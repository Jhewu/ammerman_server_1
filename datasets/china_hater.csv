"Today, prompted by an anecdote at the American Thinker, The Other McCain (the conservative Hunter S. Thompson for today) wrote about finding and convincing future ex-Democrats that conservatism is the shiznit. Also, on RedState pilgrim wrote that the Thugocracy Will Yield a Bumper Crop of Ex-Democrats. I think that I shall never see, A billboard lovely as a tree Future Ex-Democrat. (Ogden Nash, mostly) Like many another unique snowflake, I am going to apply my own unique point of view to the problem. Here goes. Luckily or not, most Republicans were raised as Republicans. Their parents were Republicans. Their parents’ parents were Republicans. The party is like mother’s milk to them, a comfort and a refuge. The other, rarer kind of Republican is the convert from either political don’t-give-a-dammism or the Democrat side of the aisle. I am going to be writing about Democrats in this article, but everything applies equally to don’t-give-a-dammers. Future ex-Democrats eventually get turned off by something in the Democrat party. It may be the economic or regulatory insanity, the alliances with America’s enemies at war, the vicious abuse of those whose opinions differ from the mob’s consensus, the egalitarian attack on equality, the Orwellian torture of language to mean its opposite, the shameless hero worship and narcissism of the movement, the treatment of women, gays and blacks as pet minorities who vote for Democrats but should really shut up, the morally inverted insistence on killing children in the womb plus saving terrorists and serial killers from the death penalty, or the general acceptance of “the lie” as the way the world is supposed to work; something about Democrats turns Future ex-Democrats off. When that turn-off happens, as it inevitably will, one of two things happens. Either the turned-off Democrat gets homesick and rejoins the Democrats, while tabling the turn-off. Or the turned-off Democrat finds something about the Republicans that is different enough, and compelling enough, to convince him to sever part or all his attachment to the Democrat Party. With some Democrats, this process will occur several times. With others there is only one chance. So we had better seize that chance! To effectively nurture turned-off Democrats and grow them into ex-Democrats and possible Republicans, Republicans need to be ready. They need to know their strengths and the corresponding Democrat weaknesses. They need to be tough instead of wishy-washy politically correct nincompoops. In other words, Republicans who wish to recruit Future ex-Democrats need to distinguish themselves from Democrats, who are wishy-washy politically correct nincompoops. Remember, if the turned-off Democrat wants to find someone who is just like a Democrat they would simply rejoin their old party. Imitating Democrats does not fool anyone. It just brings admiration from the media and Democrats (but I repeat myself) who do not have Republican best interests at heart. There are three main appeals that Republicans can make to turned-off Democrats, corresponding to the three legs of the conservative stool: Fiscal; Social; and National Security. Fiscal Conservatism and Free Market Economics As R. S. McCain points out, the biggest problem with Democrats in 2009, the year of the not-a-stimulus Stimulus and the $1.8 Trillion deficit (46% of spending and trending up), is their numbers don’t add up. Democrat economics have not ever worked, do not work now, and will never work. They are based on the same old discredited Keynesian, fascist, and socialist caveman-economics nostrums that have failed in every modern country in which they’ve been tried. To the extent that the US travels (once again) down the socialist road, that will be more wasted time, economically speaking. It always is. Compare their economics, and the economics of the middling Republicans-lite who currently dominate the leadership councils of the Republican party, to the free market economics that Reagan employed to power the American economy into 30 years of growth, that JFK used to jump start the economy in 1961, and that the underrated Harding used to recover from the Depression of 1920-21 and usher in the roaring twenties. In one year the US economy suffered a 21% contraction in GDP and unemployment up +133% from 2.1M to 4.9M, now the incident is forgotten because Harding’s approach fixed it so quickly. Of course there is an alternative to a socialist economy that Obama and his advisors may take. Often called corporatism or mercantilism, or fascism if you’re being technical, this path combines private ownership and government control of companies, with profits being privatized and losses coming out of the taxpayer’s wallet. That sounds like a bailout; doesn’t it? To the extent that the Democrat team tries to turn the American economy into another fascist command economy like that of China it will be an economic loss, and a loss of freedoms for all. There is an unpleasant memory from 2008 for many Republicans. The Ron Paul campaign demonstrated how strong the appeal of free markets can be. The Ron Paul movement tried to take the Republican party over and failed. There were some parts of the movement that Republicans were right to resist. But Ron Paul’s economics were the only economics espoused by any candidate in the elections that spoke to what was happening. And to a large degree the same excitement brought to the surface by Ron Paul’s campaign has energized the TEA Party movement, a popular grassroots movement for sound economics in a world of fiscal insanity. Republicans might desire to stick with the Keynesian ideas of the past because they are familiar, but that would be a mistake. Government stimuli have never been known to actually work. The Great Depression was not fixed with government spending. The opposite is true. It was an example of amazingly effective government propaganda and deficit financed payoffs (that we are still paying for). Republicans should not constantly invoke Reagan, but they should follow his sound economic principles. The free market economics of the Chicago school or the Hayekian and Misesian schools were behind Reagan’s greatest successes. If Republicans want to succeed they should wake up and embrace free market (libertarian) economics. It’s where the TEA Parties are leading. Republicans should not ignore it. Start at these sites. Social Conservatism: Life, Liberty, and Property Republicans believe in individual freedom as opposed to coerced sameness. We believe in law and order and politeness, and that as long as people don’t trespass on each others’ life, liberty, or property, or break the laws and duties of free men in a free society under the rule of law, they can pretty much do what they like. That does not mean license to live in anarchy, with chaos and thuggery the result, but the respect of armed men and women for each other’s unique ideas, opinions, and abilities. As a side note, this is why Republicans stink at enforcing Party uniformity in Congressional votes. They are all individualists with their own opinions, and they rebel against attempts to rein them in. The idea of equality as conservatives and Republicans understand it is that we are all unique, more unique than snowflakes, but are treated equally by the laws, with equally applicable individual duties, and are equal in the eyes of God. In nations before the US came along laws applied differently depending on who you were. A noble could ride a horse. A peasant would be flogged for riding a horse. Only the king could wear purple. Only a knight could wear boots above mid-calf. Alcohol couldn’t be purchased on Sundays unless you were a noble and member of a private club. A gentleman could flog a peasant without punishment or payment, but if a peasant hit a gentleman the punishment was death. These examples of different justice for different classes of people are an example of inequality under the law. The principle of equality under the law means that as long as people obey the laws they will be treated equally, and if they break the laws they will be treated just like others who break the same laws. This is the intent at least. Sometimes the execution falls short. But that does not damn the intent, but rather the performance. And performance can be reformed and improved, and is over time. After all, Republicans managed to get rid of slavery over the objections of the Democrat party, passed the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments against the Democrat Jim Crow laws, and wrote and voted for the bill that became the 1964 Civil Rights Act in higher percentages than the Democrats did. Slavery and its successor, Jim Crow, was the greatest injustice in the American land, and it was banned almost entirely by Republicans. Abortion is the new great injustice that kills over a million children every year, including one out of three pregnancies of black mothers. That’s true, by the way. Look it up. And I think 33% killed out of a population qualifies as genocide under the commonly accepted definitions. Yet Democrats, once again, oppose the rights of a certain class of persons. This time instead of denying a class of people, black skinned people, their liberty, they deny a class of people, unwanted or inconvenient children, the right to live. Egalitarianism: Republicans are opposed to the other concept of equality, called egalitarianism or “equality of results.” Under the concept of egalitarianism, the government takes from some and gives to others. This is a violation of property rights. If a private person did it this would be called theft. But when the government does it some claim this makes it okay. It does not. Government involvement does not turn theft into something good; it only turns the government itself into an offender against equal justice, which should protect all equally but is corrupted by a corrupt government. Life, Liberty, and Property are the three most important human rights according to Republicans. Sir William Blackstone chose them way back in 1765, because as he pointed out, when a tyrant has the right on a whim to take away Life, Liberty (freedom to travel), or Property, then none of the human rights are worth a bucket of warm spit. So these rights are jealously guarded and none have the right to take them away on a whim, but only for an offense against the law and after due deliberation by a duly appointed jury. Some Republicans may not believe in God themselves, but all Republicans fiercely guard the right of Americans to believe in God in private and in public. They realize that America was founded by people seeking the freedom to practice their religion, not by people seeking to prevent others from practicing their religion. This modern state opposition to religion in public is opposed to everything the founders stood for, was invented by the racist, anti-Catholic bigot Hugo Black, and Republicans would reverse this state hostility to religion in an instant if they could. Republicans believe in strict Constitutionalism. They believe that the Constitution was intentionally written to be a short document, with a very short list of enumerated powers for the federal government, because Madison and the rest knew the larger the federal government got the more it would steal rights and freedoms away from individuals and the states. This is the way to totalitarianism and tyranny. The United States, founded in rebellion against tyranny, must not descend into it once again. And on the question of how tightly to adhere to the plain language of the Constitution Republicans believe that you either follow the plain language of the Constitution or you’re just making it up as you go. There is no middle ground between following the Constitution and making up law by whim. Religion, constitutionalism, and rights and duties, are important for Republicans because not only do they mean something in themselves, but they also promise that Republicans actually have standards other than the rule of convenience and falsehoods that Democrats use to justify their choices. This reliability and steadfastness is more attractive than you might believe to turned-off Democrats. National Security: We’d Rather Trade, but We’re Willing to Fight for What We Believe To be prepared for war is one of the most effective means of preserving peace. Republicans generally believe that the United States will only survive and prosper if it maintains its territorial integrity. In other words it must not allow parts of the country or the waters adjoining it to become lawless or governed by foreign laws. The Constitution defines two of the federal government’s powers as military self-defense and control of immigration and citizenship. This means that the borders should be enforced. Illegal immigration must be stopped. Legal immigration, on the other hand, should be fixed. Right now legal immigration policies for countries like Mexico are draconian. They need to be repaired. But the solution to a bad law is not to break the law, but to fix it. This also means that the US should use its advanced military technology to make America and its allies safer. Missile defense is just such a technology that would prevent some nuclear weapons from getting through to kill people. There is nothing wrong with such a defensive weapon. It would never prevent 100% of Russia’s ICBMs from getting through the defensive shields anyway, but it might stop a small flight of nukes from a rogue nation such as Iran or North Korea, both of which have active nuclear weapons programs and long-range ballistic missile programs. To refuse to defend ourselves with the best technology we have is madness. When the US gets into a war Republicans support the US military until the end of the war, whether it was a Republican fight or not. We don’t believe in proportional response; we believe in overkill. Republicans believe that if you go to war with an enemy, first you kill him dead. Then you kill the corpse. Then you bomb the greasy stain. Then you plant grass over the bare dirt and put up a marble statue of a man waving a sword and perched on a rearing horse to memorialize it. There will be no negotiations other than acceptance of our surrender terms once the war starts. The American way of war is to win. That’s all there is to it! Any other choice is un-American. To choose America as an enemy is to choose death. That’s how it works when Republicans are in charge. Democrats behave the opposite way. A country that declares its enmity to America will be wheedled and bribed with incredible treasures. See Iran. And when America goes to war with a Republican president in office, Democrats will side with the enemy against their own country. Because to Democrats the political opposition to a Republican president is the most important thing in the world, they will gladly betray their own country and its soldiers to enemies while at war without ever feeling a twinge of guilt. The ends justify any means, no matter how treasonous. This behavior turns off a lot of Democrats in time of war and Republicans should always be ready to exploit it. This is what drove me away from the Democrats. Of course Republicans should prosecute treason when it happens. Unfortunately they have not been doing so, because they are scared of political in-fighting under the media spotlight. They should not be. Prosecution is the only way to discourage treason when Democrats are in the opposition. If a nation is friendly America will be the best friend it ever had. Republicans don’t believe in foreign aid; we realize the empirical fact that aid money just goes to line the pockets of dictators or pays for troops to oppress and plunder the citizens. Republicans believe in trade with countries because that creates jobs, freedom, and lasting wealth and raises the people out of poverty, instead of just turning a dictator into another billionaire. It also creates markets for American products, and brings in a multiplicity of foreign products for Americans to enjoy. Democrats behave the opposite way. A country that stands by America’s side in time of trouble will be betrayed, or treated like a pet poodle by Democrats. See Iraq. Please forgive my long-windedness. I hope that somewhere amongst all the extrapolation and digression something has proved useful for Republicans who want to improve their ability to recruit Future Ex-Democrats and convince them that Republicans are the principled, truthful, honest, hopeful, predictable, kind, and winning party.

"This is getting to be a habit. During the stimulus debate, President Obama exploited Caterpillar and spread exaggerated claims about the massive spending program’s effects on the manufacturer’s jobs. Caterpillar had to publicly refute Obama. He’s moved on to his government health care takeover plans. And once again, the b.s.’er-in-chief is using private industry to float inflating promises about the massive spending program. The health care companies have now publicly refuted Obama: Hospitals and insurance companies said Thursday that President Obama had substantially overstated their promise earlier this week to reduce the growth of health spending. Mr. Obama invited health industry leaders to the White House on Monday to trumpet their cost-control commitments. But three days later, confusion swirled in Washington as the companies’ trade associations raced to tamp down angst among members around the country. After meeting with six major health care organizations, Mr. Obama hailed their cost-cutting promise as historic. “These groups are voluntarily coming together to make an unprecedented commitment,” Mr. Obama said. “Over the next 10 years, from 2010 to 2019, they are pledging to cut the rate of growth of national health care spending by 1.5 percentage points each year — an amount that’s equal to over $2 trillion.” Health care leaders who attended the meeting have a different interpretation. They say they agreed to slow health spending in a more gradual way and did not pledge specific year-by-year cuts. “There’s been a lot of misunderstanding that has caused a lot of consternation among our members,” said Richard J. Umbdenstock, the president of the American Hospital Association. “I’ve spent the better part of the last three days trying to deal with it.” Nancy-Ann DeParle, director of the White House Office of Health Reform, said “the president misspoke” on Monday and again on Wednesday when he described the industry’s commitment in similar terms. After providing that account, Ms. DeParle called back about an hour later on Thursday and said: “I don’t think the president misspoke. His remarks correctly and accurately described the industry’s commitment.” O-nocchio! Comments are closed. Follow Us"
"The pundits are wrong. Conventional wisdom is wrong. Sarah Palin's decision to step down as Alaska governor was a brilliant move. Palin has some of the best political instincts I have ever seen. She became a pop-culture superstar overnight when John McCain made her his veep pick, and she's still second only to President Obama among politicians the public is interested in. Even in liberal San Francisco, she'd be front-page news if she ever came to town. But that kind of celebrity comes at a high price. What a lot of people don't know is that Palin entered Alaska politics as a reformer attacking the corruption of the state's Republican establishment. As such, she was the darling of the Democrats - until she hooked up with McCain. After the election, with Palin back home but positioning herself for a 2012 presidential run, it was clear she would catch nothing but ridicule from Alaska's Democrats. It was not going to be pretty. If Palin wants to play on the national field, she has to be free to move around. She has to be able to drop into Indiana, Ohio or Tennessee and help Republican candidates raise money. She has to be available for radio and TV. She has to be like Gavin Newsom, free to roam around the country, safe in the knowledge that things will pretty much take care of themselves back home. Instead, Palin faced the prospect of being constantly pinned down in a state that is a day and a half away from the rest of America. She would have been totally isolated in every sense of the word. Now she can study up on issues where she is lacking and become a full-time political celebrity. The pundits call her a quitter, but let's be honest - the pundits never liked her to begin with. Better to take one hit for stepping down and move on than to stay in Alaska and die a death by a thousand cuts. Governor or not, Palin is still the biggest star in the Republican galaxy. After all, who else have they got? It's interesting - after decades of politicians preaching about family values, we actually have a president who practices them. President Obama's decision to take his kids along with him to Russia and Italy completely stole the show. Nobody takes their kids on diplomatic missions. And it is so engaging and so authentic that you almost forgive him for not having the stimulus package working! It was wall-to-wall people the other day at the Fillmore Street Fair. Everyone was lined up to buy hats from Ms. Ruth Dewson. They were out the door. I took a look at what was taking so long for everyone to pay. It turns out Ms. Dewson has one of those old-timey registers - her bra. And she was doing one heck of a business stuffing the money in. In the time I was there she went from a 38 to a 44. Have you checked out the local music scene lately? Down at the Burlingame Grill they have a different act every night. I went there to see Bud E. Luv, who was his usual great self. Up in North Beach at Joey and Eddie's - which used to be Moose's - they have a Rat Pack tribute to Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. that had everyone dancing. We should really be more like Havana, where every club has free music early in the week. It would help fill up the town on slow nights, and maybe lead to some gigs for all these talented people on the weekends. I hopped in a cab to go to KPIX for the morning show the other day, and all the way there the cabdriver had the radio tuned to classical music. I needed to know if anything was breaking, so I asked, ""Do you ever put on the news?"" ""No,"" he said. ""Why ruin a good day?"" Hope I haven't ruined yours. Two-term mayor of San Francisco, renowned speaker of the California Assembly, and widely regarded as the most influential African American politician of the late twentieth century, Willie L. Brown, Jr. has been at the center of California politics, government and civic life for four decades. His career spans the American presidency from Lyndon Johnson to George W. Bush, and he's worked with every California governor from Pat Brown to Arnold Schwarzenegger. From civil rights to education reform, tax policy, economic development, health care, international trade, domestic partnerships and affirmative action, he's left his imprimatur on every aspect of politics and public policy in the Golden State. As mayor of California's most cosmopolitan city, he refurbished and rebuilt the nation's busiest transit system, pioneered the use of bond measures to build affordable housing, created a model juvenile justice system, and paved the way for a second campus of UCSF to serve as the anchor of a new development that will position the city as a center for the burgeoning field of biotechnology. Today, he heads the Willie L. Brown Jr. Institute on Politics and Public Service, where he shares his knowledge and skills with a new generation of California leaders."
"""One should either write ruthlessly what one believes to be the truth, or else shut up."" -- Arthur Koestler My blog is worth $210,008.88.How much is your blog worth? You're right that it always has been, but if NR wasn't a peevish clique of snobs and oddballs, it wouldn't be NR, would it?I'm fine with the National Review editorial on Birthism. I don't think the movement ought to be ignored, any more than the Birchers ought to have been ignored in their early days. Both are basically forms of political sedevacantism, which can be extremely seductive and extremely counterproductive. It is also a waste of time and money for anyone involved (although its proponents tend to make a mint off it). I usually agree with you, but on this point I think you missed the boat. NR was never supposed to be just a news mag for the conservative movement, but also a place for conservative intellectuals to get some exposure. I'm not saying that makes those writers any better than the guys in the trenches at Fox, the Washington Times, and the Boston Herald, but they're playing to a different slice of the market. Heritic!!!kidding aside.On one hand, I would like to see real proof of his birth certificate.BUT.. on the other hand, aside from the proverial smoking gun of someone stepping up and saying, ""Yes, I hid the document and here it is"", it's a very moot point. And what would happen if that was the case? Riots in most inner cities because it will be another case of The White Man Keeping The Black Man Down. And Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson will be given more prime time coverage than ever before. Can the country handle that? Also, do you want to hear the words ""President Joe Biden""? I rest my case. Hey, came looking for the FMJRA! Plus, that hot young neocon at GSGF is some notice, with trackback to R.S. McCain! See, ""'Turning the Tide of Battle': The Surge: A Military History"". ""NR was never supposed to be just a news mag for the conservative movement, but also a place for conservative intellectuals to get some exposure.""It is important to distiguish between the role that NR served in 1955 and the situation since 1981, or since 1994. Conservatism now has many powerful institutions, many media venues, many politicians who espouse its creed which is, unlike in 1955, neither novel nor ill-defined.Despite all these changes, the younger generation of NR-ites -- who have no real memory of the world pre-Reagan -- still want to try to play the role that Buckley played 1955-81. Yet there are, on Capitol Hill, perhaps as many as 200 Republican congressional aides under 40, whose names you do not even know, who are as well-versed in conservative principles as Rich Lowry. Therefore, on what basis does Lowry strike the posture of Imperial Arbiter?Yet most conservative writers are fearful of pointing this out, as their ambition (i.e., to be published by NR) conflicts with their principles (i.e., to tell the truth). This exacerbates the problem, as NR-ites become ever more arrogant because they start confusing their own individual efforts with the unchallenged superiority of NR, and develop a proprietary sense of the magazine's prestige.The baleful effect of all this is like the foolish king surrounding himself with courtiers and sycophants. You don't want to see his birth records. Fine. But what about his kindergarten records, his Punahou school records, his Occidental College records, his Columbia University records, his Columbia thesis, his Harvard Law School records, his Harvard Law Review articles, his scholarly articles from the University of Chicago, his passport, his medical records, his files from his years as an Illinois state senator, his Illinois State Bar Association records, any baptism records and adoption records. Where, oh where is that honesty and ""transparency"" Obama is so fond of demanding from everyone else? The whole birther controversy takes on a different light when one considers that Hillary Clinton had her pack of dogs investigate Obama's birth, and couldn't find anything out of place. What does that tell you? As for Rich Lowry, the firing offense ought to have been permitting the publication of David Frum's ""Unpatriotic Conservatives"" article in the spring of 2003. Lowry was a fresh-faced 28 year old when selected to edit NR, as much a symbol of WJBjr ""passing the torch to a younger generation"" as anything else. The problem is he's now just a fresh-faced 41 year old who hasn't really grown in gravitas over the years. FROM CAROL HERMAN, if I may. ""Birfirs"" is a Nixonian tag. It's placed on people to make them look extreme. While there's some truth to the fact that at age 4, Barry was adopted by his mom's new husband: LOLO SOETORO. Yes, this would change his original birth certificate. So far, you're learning that Obama has had many names. He came back to America, as a FOREIGN STUDENT! ERASED! Just like that!Sure, his mom divorced LOLO when Barry was 19. But can you erase an official adoption?And, why did Barry come back as a foreign student, using the name BARRY SOETORO. Then, with a lack of good grades he migrates to Harvard.Gee, those 'gown people' play by an assorted set of strange rules. We're just continuing to get top politicians with lousy grades: Gore, Dubya, and McCain also come to mind.But Barry actually sits, now, in the White House. When will the political parties learn to serve the very people they want to have voting for them?No. I'm not a birfer."" I came to this party way too late. But I sure suspect there's more to Barry Soetoro's resume than meets the eye. Outstanding writing Stacy:""if they actually cared about facts they wouldn't be the Left, would they?"" First point: I believe Barack Obama is qualified under Article II, not so much because I trust him (heh), but because I trust Hillary Clinton...to be Hillary Clinton. If proof of Barry's non-American birth were there to be found, the Clinton campaign would have found it during opposition research, Hillary would have arranged a come-to-Don-Vito-and-Luca meeting with him, she would have been the nominee last year and most likely the president this year.Second point: Your observations on NR go along with my impression that at least some parts of the conservative movement stand as much in need of an enema as does the GOP.Third and last point: Speaking of presidential candidates with Article II problems, what about Dennis Kucinich? Never mind whether he was born a U.S. citizen. I'm not entirely sure that guy was born on this planet. Well, write something about this, dag nabbit, while you're waiting for Smitty! I was a loyal reader of National Review for 30 years, but once I realized the insipid, moronic Kathryn Lopez was Jonah Goldberg's ""boss"", and used her bully pulpit at NRO not to discuss the primal issues of the day, but to flog the Catholic League's talking points ad nauseum, I lost interest. Nothing wrong with religion or Catholicism, but she suborned NRO to her own parochial ends.I'll never understand why Buckley threw Brookhiser to the curb and gave that nematode Lowry his magazine. Why, I have ziti on my plate that could kick Lowry's ass, and that's just in debate. I'm sure this one piece here could also out-benchpress his pussy ass. So... what you're saying is... Barry hid his birth certificate...? in Vince Foster's coffin...? before it was filled with cocain and buried at Mena? Have I got that right...? And just in case Smitty is still goofing off, MY Rule 5 stuff is up..."
"So I received an email/comment this morning about a craigslist ad soliciting health care activism for money. “Activism for money,” I thought!! Was this it at last? The missing link Democrats have been searching for? Obamacare opponents turning up at town halls really are a mob?

(click for full size) But wait, there’s more! So I started searching around, and posting links on Twitter, and reading links I received by reply. Turns out there are hundreds, if not thousands, of advertisements seeking “activists” who will be paid to support Obamacare. That’s right CNN. That’s right Olbermann. You want astroturf?

"Advertisement Supported by Green Inc. By James Kanter BRUSSELS — Carbon trading put the European Union in the environmental vanguard. Since 2005, the trade bloc has operated the world’s only continentwide system that puts a cap on greenhouse gas emissions and that requires major polluters to hold tradable allowances. But the system has also been the most “costly climate policy program in the world,” according to Jürgen R. Thumann, the president of BusinessEurope, a powerful confederation of industry and employer groups. Mr. Thumann said European business leaders are desperate to expand the system to the United States and eventually across the globe to reduce the “dangers to our ability to compete internationally.” But with talks on a new global climate treaty seemingly at a stalemate, and with climate legislation delayed in major polluting countries like the United States and Australia, those prospects look increasingly distant. Meanwhile the E.U. shows no sign of abandoning the system, leaving business leaders like Mr. Thumann with little choice but to speak out at home and to press developed nations abroad to match Europe’s efforts when they gather at the U.N. summit meeting on climate change in December in Copenhagen. Carbon trading was supposed to be the least costly way for Europe to cut emissions. The idea is that industries buy allowances to emit greenhouse gases if they exceed a certain quota or sell them if they have too many. But Europe’s relationship with carbon trading goes much deeper than economics, and “is now rooted in the bloc’s aspirations to global leadership,” said Bernice Lee, an expert in energy and environment at Chatham House, a research institution in London. After the United States declined to ratify the Kyoto Protocol in 2001, Europeans swung their weight behind the treaty, which was the first major attempt to limit emissions globally. As part of those efforts, Europe supported a bid by Russia to join the World Trade Organization. Vladimir Putin, as Russian president, reciprocated by supporting Kyoto. The treaty required ratification by countries producing at least 55 percent of the world’s greenhouse gases and support from Russia, with its large share of emissions, allowed the treaty to take effect. More recently, the E.U. authorities have identified carbon trading as a way of raising huge sums of money demanded by developing nations as part of any new global climate treaty. Ms. Lee of Chatham House said there was “a strong and growing appreciation by E.U. governments” that the revenues generated from selling pollution allowances could help them to balance their own budgets, as well as fund climate-related initiatives. Even as European nations deepen their reliance on carbon trading, governments elsewhere still are struggling to put such systems in place. In the United States, legislation to set up carbon trading is stuck in the Senate, which probably will not act until next year. In Australia, the government could call an election on the issue if the legislation fails to pass on its second attempt in November. In Japan, a new government wants to introduce carbon trading but faces stiff resistance from industry as the country emerges from its deepest postwar recession. Another factor that continues to muddy the prospects for carbon trading are reports of abuse and manipulation. In August, it emerged that British customs officials had arrested seven people near London for dodging a value added tax, which should have been paid for selling large amounts of allowances. In a bid to stop similar cases in the future, Britain, France and the Netherlands have exempted carbon trading from the levy. Last week, an E.U. court ruled that Poland and Estonia could challenge the European Commission’s assessment of how many allowances their industries were entitled to. That stoked fears among traders that those governments would take advantage of the ruling to issue larger numbers of allowances to favored industries than was originally permitted. E.U. officials sought to quash speculation about the long-term stability of the carbon markets by saying governments would no longer have the same right to intervene after 2012. But prices of allowances still fell sharply on carbon markets. Perhaps the thorniest problem for E.U. environment officials is how to make the system more palatable for business without entirely neutering its chances of cutting emissions. Stavros Dimas, the E.U. environment commissioner, pushed forward this month with plans to continue giving large amounts of allowances away free to industry sectors most exposed to international competition. The French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, said this month that he and Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, were proceeding with plans for a “border adjustment tax” on imports from countries without targets and trading systems comparable to those in Europe. Mr. Sarkozy’s approach is sure to stoke tensions with some of the Continent’s major trading partners. Such taxes could start even start a protectionist backlash – a prospect that compounds Mr. Thumann’s concerns about the effects of carbon trading on European competitiveness. “Climate protection is one of the saddest examples of a failure by leading nations to coordinate responses,” said Mr. Thumann of BusinessEurope. “We’ve got to have closer international cooperation to reduce emissions cost-effectively,” he said.

"By Jack Kelly - September 29, 2009 The contempt with which the president of France regards the president of the United States was displayed in public last week. Nicolas Sarkozy was furious with Barack Obama for his adolescent warbling about a world without nuclear weapons at a meeting Mr. Obama chaired of the United Nations Security Council last Thursday (9/24). ""We must never stop until we see the day when nuclear arms have been banished from the face of the earth,"" President Obama said. What infuriated President Sarkozy was that at the time Mr. Obama said those words, Mr. Obama knew the mullahs in Iran had a secret nuclear weapons development site, and he didn't call them on it. ‘President Obama dreams of a world without weapons...but right in front of us two countries are doing the exact opposite,"" Mr. Sarkozy said. ""Iran since 2005 has flouted five Security Council resolutions,"" Mr. Sarkozy said. ""North Korea has been defying Council resolutions since 1993."" ""What good has proposals for dialogue brought the international community?"" he asked rhetorically. ""More uranium enrichment and declarations by the leaders of Iran to wipe out a UN member state off the map."" If the Security Council had imposed serious sanctions on the regimes which are flouting UN resolutions, the resolution Mr. Obama proposed about working toward nuclear disarmament wouldn't have been so meaningless, Mr. Sarkozy implied. ""If we have courage to impose sanctions together it will lend viability to our commitment to reduce or own weapons and to making a world without nuke weapons,"" he said. The extent of President Obama's naivete - or duplicity - was on display Friday at the G20 summit when the president, flanked by Mr. Sarkozy and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, revealed to the American public that Iran had a second nuclear weapons site on a military base near the holy city of Qom. News reports indicated Mr. Obama had been briefed on the site before his inauguration. But he's been conducting his foreign policy as if the mullahs could be trusted. ""Iran has been put on notice,"" President Obama said in Pittsburgh. Iran responded to being ""put on notice"" by testing Monday two ballistic missiles that could carry a nuclear warhead 1,200 miles. It was to protect Europe from such missiles that the ABM system President Obama abruptly cancelled earlier this month was designed. Obama administration officials said the ABM cancellation - regarded as a betrayal by Poland and the Czech Republic, where the missiles and radars were to be located - actually improved U.S. security, because it has made Russia more amenable to sanctions against Iran. The UN Security Council has never passed strong sanctions against Iran because Russia and China have vetoed them. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said he still doesn't like economic sanctions, but will support them if diplomacy fails. China remains opposed. President Obama shouldn't count on Russian support, said Soviet expert David Satter. ""Words are cheap for the Kremlin and the Iranians are aware of this,"" he said. ""The Russians, having endorsed sanctions, will now find hundreds of reasons why any specific sanctions package is unfair...The reason is that support for Iran is Russia's most important trump card in foreign relations and there is little likelihood they will give it up."" Iran has been put on notice before. At the G8 meeting in Italy in July, Mr. Obama and other leaders set a ""firm deadline"" of Sep. 10 for the Iranians to make a serious offer to negotiate about their nuclear program. When the mullahs blew him off, Mr. Obama quietly extended the deadline until December. December could be too late. ""Tehran soon could have humankind's most frightening weapon if substantial diplomatic progress is not made in the coming days,"" Rep. Howard Berman (D-Cal), the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee said Saturday (9/26). If severe economic sanctions are not imposed immediately, in months if not in weeks, only a military strike will b e able to prevent an Iranian bomb. But after sternly lecturing Iran on its international obligations Friday, President Obama didn't call for sanctions. He called for more negotiations. And then, as the Iranians were spitting in his eye with the missile test, he jetted off to Copenhagen to lobby to have the 2016 Olympics held in Chicago. No wonder Nicolas Sarkozy holds him in contempt. Jack Kelly is a columnist for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and The Blade of Toledo, Ohio. Author Archive More Tweets »"
"I’ve always thought that they’re better off going for a liberal bill that the left will love and the right will hate rather than some weak-tea compromise that will only irritate both sides. In the former scenario, they get rapturous press and GOTV support from progressives next year; in the latter, they get a disaffected base and plenty of angry conservatives at the polls regardless. The GOP picks up seats either way but there’s no reason necessarily to think they pick up more in scenario one than scenario two. Sounds like The One’s figured it out, although predictably he’s unwilling to gamble his political capital on full-throated support for a government plan. Better to save that sort of thing for, say, the Olympics, where there are few political consequences to flaming out spectacularly. But now, senior administration officials are holding private meetings almost daily at the Capitol with senior Democratic staff to discuss ways to include a version of the public plan in the health care bill that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., plans to bring to the Senate floor later this month, according to senior Democratic congressional aides… At the same time, Obama has been reaching out personally to rank-and-file Senate Democrats, telephoning more than a dozen lawmakers in the last week to press the case for action… “The challenge is to go to the (Senate) floor, hold the deal,” said Steve Elmendorf, a lobbyist who was chief of staff to former House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt. But “they are more involved than people think. They have a plan and a strategy, and they know what they want to get and they work with people to get it.”… He has met repeatedly in private with Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, who has floated a proposal to allow states to set up government plans as a fallback if commercial insurers do not control premiums. Any problem with setting up the public option as plan B if and only if private insurance premiums spiral out of control? Why, yes: Between requiring all Americans to carry insurance and requiring all insurance companies to cover people regardless of preexisting conditions, the final bill’s practically guaranteed to generate that spiral. Robert Tracinski: The Baucus bill includes an “individual mandate” that requires everyone to buy health insurance-but not inexpensive, high-deductible catastrophic health insurance. Instead, it imposes a requirement for pricier comprehensive coverage that pays for routine costs like annual checkups. The bill then requires that insurance companies provide coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, and that they charge customers at high risk of medical problems the same rates as those with lower risks-which means that these extra expenses will have to be paid for by raising everyone else’s premiums. And then the Baucus bill delivers the knock-out punch: after forcing us into expensive comprehensive insurance plans and driving up the cost of those plans, the bill would impose a massive 40% tax on “gold-plated” plans-which turn out to include the health-insurance plans of many in the middle class. So that drives up the cost of insurance even higher. You can see why it doesn’t much matter whether or not we have a “public option” in the original bill. Everything else in the bill is designed to make private health insurance unaffordable-so that in a few years, people will clamor for a government-subsidized “public option,” and the same politicians who destroyed private health insurance can make a big show of coming to the rescue of their victims. A fascinating hypothetical: What if the Democrats push through a bill without a public option, the GOP takes back Congress next year, and then Tracinski’s nightmare comes to pass? Would the GOP have the stones to try to repeal the individual mandate (quite possibly) or the requirement that preexisting conditions be covered (quite impossibly)? Would they dare consider “riding to the rescue” by passing some sort of limited public option? That sounds like an insane question to ask, but remember who we’re talking about here. Follow the Tribune link and read down to the end and you’ll find the Democrats leaning hard on congressional waverers with polls about how much support the public option allegedly draws. Funny how those polls change once you introduce the possibility of adverse consequences. I’m tempted to say that the GOP should start a message blitz about those consequences ASAP, but given the near certainty that the individual mandate and preexisting coverage provisions will pass, what good will it do in the end?

"Right now in America, the people of this great nation are staring down the loaded barrel of government-run healthcare. If this bill passes, it is no less than the end of America as we know it. You know it. Most Americans knows it. Yet the people most in a position to do anything about it right now – Senate Republicans – are doing absolutely nothing. If anything, they actually are HELPING Democrats by offering amendments to “highlight problems in the bill,” giving the Democrats the opportunity to produce “cover votes.” Consider the comments of the number two Senate Republican, Jon Kyl, yesterday on Bill Bennett’s radio show, being hosted by Rick Santorum (hat tip to mayhem in comments of one of Erick’s post, here). In response to the question, “what is your strategy, to the extent you can share it,” Kyl said, “actually, I think we can be fairly upfront about it. Our strategy is not actually to delay and not take votes.” He added, “our strategy is to have a lot of good amendments and highlight the problems in the bill,” and “it is not our strategy to somehow slow things down.” This is what happens when Senators sit around their offices with overpaid, but largely incompetent staff in fancy rooms scattered about the Capitol – and they listen to pollsters and political strategists talking about how unpopular this bill is, but stressing that Republicans “need to be for something.” Senator Kyl continued, spending several minutes detailing the GOP strategy to improve the bill with amendments. But, then, the Jon Kyl that we usually applaud conceded that it was simply not possible to improve a bill that at its core allows a government takeover of health care. On the show, he said, “it is the guts of this bill that’s the problem,” Kyl told Santorum. “These guys [the Democrats] will come back and say, ‘Oh, we fixed this and we fixed that and so on.’ But did you fix the guts of the bill?” “I do not want constituents, wherever they are, to let their senators off the hook on the guts of the bill.” Right. So, use very tool at your disposal to kill it. There are two possible strategies to kill this bill. 1. Force a vote as soon as possible to try to deny Democrats the opportunity to build 60 votes. 2. Delay, obstruct and fight – using every parliamentary tactic in the book – such as forcing a reading of the bill, offering strategic amendments, etc… – and try to build up so much public opposition that Democrats cannot get 60 votes. The tools for this strategy were outlined by Senator Judd Gregg, but this is being ignored in favor of “messaging amendments” (code for: we don’t have a plan, so let’s offer “messaging amendments” even though we have no actual message, instead of useful, divisive amendments that might actually be a poison pill). The current strategy is not a strategy at all. It’s a gutless, foolish exercise in Senate-itis… a deadly disease inflicting many, where people who have been on Capitol Hill for too long begin listening to themselves and their tired, hack staff… drinking their own Koolaid, if I may say it… happy to sit back and enjoy their supposedly improving popularity in the polls as a result of anti-Obama sentiment, and the supposed great forecast for 2010 elections… As a result, Republicans are playing into Democrat hands – and America will be the big loser. Government-run healthcare for all – freedom for none. "
"d politician. Daniels writes his own speeches — and they are thoughtful, substantive exercises — and even pens the content of his political ads. His demeanor is friendly and his posture is forward-looking. He has never run a negative ad. He is a conservative, but not of the grievance variety. In style, Daniels is low-key and witty without being arrogant. In his first run for governor, he traveled the state on his motorcycle or in his motor home, spending the night as the guest of ordinary Hoosiers. His self-deprecating humor made his travels into a popular show — ""MitchTV"" — still available on YouTube. He treats every voter (supporter or not) with respect. And he's not above enjoying himself at a state fair (his wife won the watermelon seed spitting contest). He's been called the ""anti-Obama,"" but the contrast is not in style. Both men are poised, intelligent, and well spoken. The most glaring contrast (aside from philosophy) is Daniels' wealth of experience and record of governing success. Daniels has offered the view that a Republican candidate in 2012 must present a credible plan for solving the spending, deficit, and debt crisis the country is in and campaign to ""govern, not just to win."" He'd rather someone else do it, which is understandable. He promised Hoosiers he would serve out his term, and feels duty bound to abide by his promise. But Daniels has a combination of traits — broad experience, wisdom, skill, and likeability — that are rarer than rare. Surely Hoosiers would release him from his promise if he asked — if we all asked. He earned his spot on the short list of possibilities the hard way: In a quicksand year for Republicans, he managed to win re-election as governor by 18 points (in a state Obama carried). His margin of victory included 24 percent of Democrats, 20 percent of African-Americans, 51 percent of the youth vote, 67 percent of the elderly, and 57 percent of independents. When Daniels took office in 2004, Indiana, which had been enduring Democratic governors for 16 years, was running an $800 million deficit. Four years later, it had a $1.3 billion surplus. Daniels accomplished this without raising taxes (as 66 percent of states have done); in fact, he passed the largest tax cut in state history. Nor did he cut essential services like education, as 40 states have done. As Mark Hemingway reported in National Review, ""In the last three years, the state has repaid $760 million to schools and local governments that had been appropriated to finance the state's deficit spending."" Additionally, Indiana has hired 800 new child welfare caseworkers and 250 state troopers, all while cutting the rate of increase in state spending from 5.9 to 2.8 percent annually. Daniels has successfully courted business investment and has welcomed ""two Toyota plants, a Honda factory, a $500 million Nestle facility, and a British Petroleum project that will bring $3.8 billion to the state …"" This is a laboratory of successful conservative governance. As Daniels put it to NR, ""Our health-care plan is health savings accounts for poor people. Our telecommunications policy is deregulation. Our infrastructure policy was the biggest privatization in state history."" And his spending policy was less is more. A former chief of the Office of Management and Budget (under George W. Bush), Daniels is known for his incisive mind and mastery of detail. In addition to government service (he also worked as an aide to Sen. Richard Lugar and as Ronald Reagan's political director), Daniels has headed a conservative think tank, the Hudson Institute, and served as president of Eli Lilly's North American operations.

By Mona Charen  | On the morning of Nov. 5, 2008, the world rocked to news that the United States had elected Barack Obama to the presidency. That same morning, Mitch Daniels, governor of Indiana, joined the list of those most often mentioned as potentially defeating President Obama in 2012. In what may be a sign of unusual mental health and emotional balance, Daniels persistently declined to be considered a candidate. Among his many reasons, he told Brian Lamb, was reluctance to subject his family to the ""savagery"" of presidential politics. It is great news for the country, if not for him, that he has at last relented and agreed to keep the door open — if only a crack. He earned his spot on the short list of possibilities the hard way: In a quicksand year for Republicans, he managed to win re-election as governor by 18 points (in a state Obama carried). His margin of victory included 24 percent of Democrats, 20 percent of African-Americans, 51 percent of the youth vote, 67 percent of the elderly, and 57 percent of independents. When Daniels took office in 2004, Indiana, which had been enduring Democratic governors for 16 years, was running an $800 million deficit. Four years later, it had a $1.3 billion surplus. Daniels accomplished this without raising taxes (as 66 percent of states have done); in fact, he passed the largest tax cut in state history. Nor did he cut essential services like education, as 40 states have done. As Mark Hemingway reported in National Review, ""In the last three years, the state has repaid $760 million to schools and local governments that had been appropriated to finance the state's deficit spending."" Additionally, Indiana has hired 800 new child welfare caseworkers and 250 state troopers, all while cutting the rate of increase in state spending from 5.9 to 2.8 percent annually. Daniels has successfully courted business investment and has welcomed ""two Toyota plants, a Honda factory, a $500 million Nestle facility, and a British Petroleum project that will bring $3.8 billion to the state …"" This is a laboratory of successful conservative governance. As Daniels put it to NR, ""Our health-care plan is health savings accounts for poor people. Our telecommunications policy is deregulation. Our infrastructure policy was the biggest privatization in state history."" And his spending policy was less is more. A former chief of the Office of Management and Budget (under George W. Bush), Daniels is known for his incisive mind and mastery of detail. In addition to government service (he also worked as an aide to Sen. Richard Lugar and as Ronald Reagan's political director), Daniels has headed a conservative think tank, the Hudson Institute, and served as president of Eli Lilly's North American operations. This is not a slick, packaged politician. Daniels writes his own speeches — and they are thoughtful, substantive exercises — and even pens the content of his political ads. His demeanor is friendly and his posture is forward-looking. He has never run a negative ad. He is a conservative, but not of the grievance variety.

Bush), Daniels is known for his incisive mind and mastery of detail. In addition to government service (he also worked as an aide to Sen. Richard Lugar and as Ronald Reagan's political director), Daniels has headed a conservative think tank, the Hudson Institute, and served as president of Eli Lilly's North American operations.

"Advertisement Supported by By Charlie Savage and Bernie Becker WASHINGTON — During his confirmation last year, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. failed to notify the Senate that he had signed several briefs urging courts to reject President George W. Bush’s claim that he had the power to imprison an American citizen as an “enemy combatant,” the Justice Department acknowledged Thursday. “The briefs should have been disclosed as part of the confirmation process,” said Matthew Miller, a Justice Department spokesman. “In preparing thousands of pages for submission, it was unfortunately and inadvertently missed. In any event, the attorney general has publicly discussed his positions on detention policy on many occasions, including at his confirmation hearing.” But at a meeting of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which held the confirmation hearing, Republicans signaled that they were likely to attack Mr. Holder over his joining the briefs — and his failure to list them, along with other public documents, on a routine confirmation questionnaire — when he testifies before them later this month. “Are we expected to believe that then-nominee Holder, with only a handful of Supreme Court briefs to his name, forgot about his role in one of this country’s most publicized terrorism cases?” asked Senator Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona. And Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, said the opinions in the briefs “go to the heart of his responsibilities in matters of national security.” “This is an extremely serious matter,” he said, “and the attorney general will have to address it.” The comments opened a new chapter in a controversy over the Obama administration’s hiring of lawyers who had worked on detainee-related litigation. Last week, a group led by Liz Cheney, a daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, and Bill Kristol of The Weekly Standard, produced a video criticizing the Justice Department for refusing to name seven officials who previously helped detainees challenge their imprisonment. The video called the lawyers the “Al Qaeda Seven” and suggested they shared terrorists’ values. Critics, including many conservatives, accused the group of McCarthyism. Then National Review published an articleby two former Bush officials highlighting the briefs — and Mr. Holder’s failure to disclose them. The documents were “friend of the court” briefs submitted to the Supreme Court by several former Clinton administration officials, including Mr. Holder and former Attorney General Janet Reno. Mr. Miller said the group submitted several versions of the brief at different stages in the case of Jose Padilla, an American citizen who had been arrested in Chicago in 2002 and accused of planning an attack for Al Qaeda. President Bush designated Mr. Padilla an enemy combatant, placed him in military custody, cut off his access to a lawyer and declared he could imprison him indefinitely for the purpose of interrogation, without judicial review. One brief urged the Supreme Court to rule that policy illegal, arguing that “our nation has always been prepared to accept some risk as the price of guaranteeing that the executive does not have arbitrary power to imprison citizens.” Instead, the court voted 5 to 4 to send the case back to a lower court. Still, five of nine justices indicated they disagreed with the Bush administration. The four dissenters said that Mr. Padilla was entitled to a hearing and that incommunicado detention for interrogation was unlawful. A fifth, Justice Antonin Scalia, said in a related case that citizens must be given trials or released. Mr. Padilla was moved back into the criminal justice system before his case could return to the Supreme Court. He was convicted after a trial in 2007. Advertisement"
"Posted on | April 23, 2010 | 11 Comments by Smitty Have you been to any Tea Party events in the last year, Alex? (Emphasis/formatting mine) The Tea Party. The longer I report on this the more I think that the answer is Politico makes a similar point today. The movement is now doubt influential. It is forcing moderate Republicans to the right. It scared the Democrats witless over health care. It helped get Scott Brown elected. But as it stands it will not be a transformative force. Its glue is anger about the recession, the spending and about Barack Obama’s agenda. You’re dangerously close to something at the end of that paragraph, Alex. BHO is really a tool. He represents the pinnacle of homo progressivus, that delicate colloidal suspension of Marxism in hogwash that really feels that a human ant colony would be a great way to live. Especially if BHO and his puppet masters retain control. It has no real coherent ideas beyond a nebulous anti-Washington-ism, fiscal control and lower taxes. There are very few genuine libertarians with real ideas about controlling spending, such as privatising social security, a savings plan to replace Medicare, or axing a federal department or two. The reason Ron Paul wins all these straw polls is he is one of the very few with ideas. Maybe the point is less obvious from Merry England, Alex, but the root of the problems reside in the Constitutional ignorance of those taking an oath to uphold notions of Federalism, separation of powers, and common sense. We The People have been absentee landlords for decades. The lack of coherent ideas has to do with the fact that Congress, as a unit, is a stone-cold pack of liars. Walking that back just a bit, the system that has evolved the last century renders forthright behavior a virtual impossibility. Even the most individually honest, personally respectable members of Congress are at pains to accomplish much without veering in the direction of grey areas. “The Problem Will Never Fix the Problem“, states a profound post. The Federal government is collapsing in the direction of autocracy. When peaceful, impassioned citizens gather, that government and its propaganda organs started out by calling We The People racists and birthers. This hasn’t gained traction, due to the predominantly false nature of the charge. Then came astro-turf knock-offs like the Coffee Party. This week we’re seeing old tools like Bill Clinton employed to call We The People terrorists. This is going over like a showing of Triumph of the Will in a synagogue. One is generally perplexed about what the Left will do next to dismiss the 80%-ish of Americans who understand that the Progressive plug must be pulled, and now. If the debt was not such a crushing threat, one would expect the Left to veer back towards the middle, which is how Independents were duped into voting for BHO in 2008. A simple course correction, a few Stupakian bargains, combined with some statistical manipulations of jobs, home sales, and the stock markets, and the approval ratings would improve enough tho be manageable for 2012. Also, more attempts to break up the Tea Parties along social vs. fiscal lines. Foreign policy is peripheral at Tea Parties, from what I’ve seen. The blogs, Tea Parties, those rabid PJTV extremists are all combining to keep the pressure up. There is no lack of ideas, though. There is a surplus of ideas, constantly batted about. The Contract From America bears mention. Are these the final answers? Of course not. We can’t expect to erase a century of drift in even a decade. We can, we must attack the systemic causes of the situation. Chronic deficits are unethical. Taxing unrepresented future generations with debt is unethical. Acting as though the Constitution can be amended by systematically ignoring its provisions where inconvenient is unethical. Incumbency, in general, is a bad idea. Federal involvement in non-Federal issues is a bad idea. And so forth. Pragmatically, the Tea Parties know that elections matter. Lots of people can make clever signs, but the Tea Party has to transition from a pleasant group hug at the town square to volunteer activism on a scale to make Madame Bowel Movement eat. . .her words. Will the Tea Party effect that shift? Those of us who expect to greet the Founding Fathers in the afterlife, which is a sizeable chunk of the Tea Parties, won’t be ashamed at that meeting, I expect. 11 Responses to “Alex Spillius: How Many Tea Parties Have You Attended?” Smitty, Bertha Lewis is 100% accurate.

"Trending: What with the Fort Hood mass murderer, the Christmas Pantybomber and now the Times Square Bomber, you may have noticed a little uptick in attempted terrorist attacks on the U.S. mainland in the last few months. Rep. Lamar Smith did, and, at the House Judiciary Committee, he was interested to see if the attorney general of the United States thought there might be any factor in common between these perplexingly diverse incidents. “In the case of all three attempts in the last year, the terrorist attempts, one of which was successful, those individuals have had ties to radical Islam,” said Congressman Smith. “Do you feel that these individuals might have been incited to take the actions that they did because of radical Islam?” “Because of … ?” “Radical Islam,” repeated Smith. “There are a variety of reasons why I think people have taken these actions,” replied Eric Holder noncommittally. “I think you have to look at each individual case.” The congressman tried again. “Yes, but radical Islam could have been one of the reasons?” “There are a variety of reasons why people … .” “But was radical Islam one of them?” “There are a variety of reasons why people do things,” the attorney general said again. “Some of them are potentially religious … .” Stuff happens. Hard to say why. “Okay,” said Smith. “But all I’m asking is if you think among those variety of reasons radical Islam might have been one of the reasons that the individuals took the steps that they did.” “You see, you say ‘radical Islam,'” objected Holder. “I mean, I think those people who espouse a – a version of Islam that is not … .” “Are you uncomfortable attributing any actions to radical Islam?” asked Smith. “It sounds like it.” And so on, and so forth. At Fort Hood, Maj. Hasan jumped on a table and gunned down his comrades while screaming, “Allahu Akbar!”, which is Arabic for “Nothing to see here” and an early indicator of pre-Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. The Times Square Bomber, we are assured by The Washington Post, CNN and Newsweek, was upset by foreclosure proceedings on his house. Mortgage-related issues. Nothing to do with months of training at a Taliban camp in Waziristan. Listening to Attorney General Holder, one is tempted to modify Trotsky: You may not be interested in Islam but Islam is interested in you. Islam smells weakness at the heart of the West. The post-World War II order is dying: The European Union’s decision to toss a trillion dollars to prop up a Greek economic model that guarantees terminal insolvency is merely the latest manifestation of the chronic combination of fiscal profligacy and demographic decline in the West at twilight. Islam is already the biggest supplier of new Europeans and new Canadians, and the fastest-growing demographic in the Western world. Therefore, it thinks it not unreasonable to shape the character of those societies – not by blowing up buildings and airplanes, but by determining the nature of their relationship to Islam. For example, the very same day that Eric Holder was doing his “Islam? What Islam?” routine at the Capitol, the Organization of the Islamic Conference was tightening its hold on the U.N. Human Rights Council – actually, make that the U.N. “Human Rights” Council. The OIC is the biggest voting bloc at the U.N., and it succeeded in getting its slate of candidates elected to the so-called “human rights” body – among them the Maldives, Qatar, Malaysia, Mauritania and Libya. The last, elected to the HRC by 80 percent of the U.N. membership, is, of course, a famous paragon of human rights, but the other, “moderate” Muslim nations share the view that Islam, in both its theological and political components, should be beyond discussion. And they will support the U.N.’s rapid progress toward, in effect, the imposition of a global apostasy law that removes Islam from public discourse. Attorney General Holder seems to be operating an advance pilot program of his own, but he’s not alone. Also last week, the head of Canada’s intelligence service testified to the House of Commons about hundreds of “second- or third-generation Canadians” who are “relatively well integrated” “economically and socially” but who have become so “very very disenchanted” with “the way we want to structure our society” that they have developed “strong links to homelands” that are “in distress.” Homelands such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia. Hmm. If you’re wondering what those countries might have in common, keep wondering. No words beginning with “I-” and ending with “-slam” passed the director’s lips. If the head of the Crown’s intelligence service has narrowed his concerns about “disenchanted” “second- and third-generations Canadians” to any demographic group in particular, evidently it’s classified information and can’t be disclosed in public. The U.N. elections are a big victory for the Organization of the Islamic Conference. By the way, to my liberal friends who say, “Hey, what’s the big deal about the Organization of the Islamic Conference? Lighten up, man,” try rolling around your tongue the words “Organization of the Christian Conference.” Would you be quite so cool with that? Fifty-seven Prime Ministers and Presidents who get together and vote as a bloc in international affairs? Or would that be a theocratic affront to secular sensibilities? The casual acceptance of the phrase “the Muslim world” – (“Mr. Obama’s now-famous speech to the Muslim world” – The New York Times) – implicitly defers to the political ambitions of Islam. And, if there is a “Muslim world,” what are its boundaries? Forty years ago, the OIC began with mainly Middle Eastern members plus Indonesia and a couple more. By the Nineties, former Soviet Central Asia had signed on, plus Albania, Mozambique, Guyana and various others. In 2005, Russia was admitted to “observer” membership. But along with the big headline victories go smaller ones. These days, Islam doesn’t even have to show up. The Metropolitan Museum of Art has quietly pulled representations of Mohammed from its Islamic collection. With the Danish cartoons, violent mobs actually had to kill large numbers of people before Kurt Westegaard was sent into involuntary “retirement.” Even with “South Park,” the thugs still had to threaten murder. But the Metropolitan Museum caved pre-emptively – no murders, no threats but best to crawl into a fetal position, anyway. Last week, the American Association of Pediatricians noted that certain, ahem, “immigrant communities” were shipping their daughters overseas to undergo “female genital mutilation.” So, in a spirit of multicultural compromise, they decided to amend their previous opposition to the practice: They’re not (for the moment) advocating full-scale clitoridectomies, but they are suggesting federal and state laws be changed to permit them to give a “ritual nick” to young girls. A few years back, I thought even fainthearted Western liberals might draw the line at “FGM.” After all, it’s a key pillar of institutional misogyny in Islam: Its entire purpose is to deny women sexual pleasure. True, many of us hapless Western men find we deny women sexual pleasure without even trying, but we don’t demand genital mutilation to guarantee it. On such slender distinctions does civilization rest. Der Spiegel, an impeccably liberal magazine, summed up the remorseless Islamization of Europe in a recent headline: “How Much Allah Can The Old Continent Bear?” Well, what’s wrong with a little Allah-lite? The AAP thinks you can hop on the Sharia express and only ride a couple of stops. In such ostensibly minor concessions, the “ritual nick” we’re performing is on ourselves.

"Anyone inclined to lament the state of classical music today should read Hector Berlioz’s Memoires. As the maverick French composer tours mid-nineteenth-century Europe conducting his revolutionary works, he encounters orchestras unable to play in tune and conductors who can’t read scores. A Paris premiere of a Berlioz cantata fizzles when a missed cue sets off a chain reaction of paralyzed silence throughout the entire sorry band. Most infuriating to this champion of artistic integrity, publishers and conductors routinely bastardize the scores of Mozart, Beethoven, and other titans, conforming them to their own allegedly superior musical understanding or to the narrow taste of the public. Berlioz’s exuberant tales of musical triumph and defeat constitute the most captivating chronicle of artistic passion ever written. They also lead to the conclusion that, in many respects, we live in a golden age of classical music. Such an observation defies received wisdom, which seizes on every symphony budget deficit to herald classical music’s imminent demise. But this declinist perspective ignores the more significant reality of our time: never before has so much great music been available to so many people, performed at levels of artistry that would have astounded Berlioz and his peers. Students flock to conservatories and graduate with skills once possessed only by a few virtuosi. More people listen to classical music today, and more money gets spent on producing and disseminating it, than ever before. Respect for a composer’s intentions, for which Berlioz fought so heroically, is now an article of faith among musicians and publishers alike. True, the tidal wave of creation that generated the masterpieces we so magnificently perform is spent; we’re left to scavenge the marvels that it cast up. The musical language that united Bach, Schubert, Mahler, and Prokofiev finally dissolved into inaccessible atonalism by the mid-twentieth century; subsequent efforts to reconstitute it have yet to gather the momentum of the past. But in recompense for living in an age of musical re-creation, we occupy a vast musical universe, far larger than the one that surrounded a nineteenth-century resident of Paris or Vienna. We can hear the beauty in the poignant chromaticism of Gesualdo and the mysterious silences of C. P. E. Bach, no less than in the by now more familiar cadences of Beethoven and Brahms. And at a time when much of the academy has lost interest in history, contemporary classical-music culture is one of the last redoubts of the humanist impulse. The desire to know the past has grown white-hot among certain musicians over the last 50 years, resulting in a performance revolution that is the most dynamic musical development in recent times. A twenty-first-century music lover plunged into the concert world of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries would find himself in an alien land, surrounded by strange customs and parochial tastes. Works that we now regard as formally perfect were dismembered: only a single movement of a work’s full three or four might ever be performed, with the remaining movements regarded as inessential. Musical forms, such as the sonata, that are central to contemporary performance practice were kept out of the concert hall, considered too difficult for the public to absorb. And the universal loathing directed by today’s audiences at the hapless recipient of a mid-performance cell-phone call would have struck eighteenth-century audiences as provincial, given the widespread use of concerts and opera as pleasant backdrops for lively conversation. But the greatest difference between the musical past and present is what we might call musical teleology: the belief that music progresses over time. That belief had consequences that many contemporary listeners and musicians would find shocking. Throughout much of Western history, older works held little interest for average listeners—they wanted the most up-to-date styles in singing and harmony. Seventeenth-century Venetians shunned last year’s operas; nineteenth-century Parisians yawned at the elegant entertainments written for the Sun King. Composers like Bach, today viewed as cornerstones of Western civilization, were seen as impossibly old-fashioned several decades after their deaths. In his 1823 Life of Rossini, Stendhal wondered: “What will happen in twenty years’ time when The Barber of Seville [composed in 1816] will be as old-fashioned as Il Matrimonio Segreto [a 1792 opera by Domenico Cimarosa] or Don Giovanni [1787]?” Stendhal’s musical crystal ball obviously had its flaws. Berlioz was in many ways a musical teleologist himself, but he fiercely opposed the widespread outcome of the belief in musical progress: the posthumous rewriting of scores. Performers and publishers unapologetically revised works that we now regard as transcendent, seeking to correct their perceived deficiencies and bring them up to newer standards of orchestration and harmony. After describing a particularly brutal mauling of The Magic Flute for its 1801 Paris premiere and a dumbing-down of Carl Maria von Weber’s Der Freischütz, Berlioz erupts: “Thus, dressed as apes, got up grotesquely in cheap finery, one eye gouged out, an arm withered, a leg broken, two men of genius were introduced to the French public! . . . No, no, no, a million times no! You musicians, you poets, prose-writers, actors, pianists, conductors, whether of third or second or even first rank, you do not have the right to meddle with a Shakespeare or a Beethoven, in order to bestow on them the blessings of your knowledge and taste.” Conservative pedagogues altered scores as well—on the ground that they were too modern. Berlioz headed off at the last minute what he called “emasculations” to Beethoven’s avant-garde harmonies that the influential music critic and teacher François-Joseph Fétis had surreptitiously introduced into a forthcoming edition of Beethoven’s symphonies. For all Berlioz’s efforts to preserve the score’s integrity, however—during a performance of Gluck’s Iphigénie en Tauride, he shouted from the audience: “There are no cymbals there. Who has dared to correct Gluck?”—he could not dislodge the practice of “improving” older works of music. Virtuosi added to a piece whatever fireworks the composer had carelessly neglected to include. In 1837, Franz Liszt had a pang of conscience over his habit of pumping up his performances of Beethoven, Weber, and Johann Nepomuk Hummel with rapid runs and cadenzas. He briefly saw the error of his ways: “I no longer divorce a composition from the era in which it was written, and any claim to embellish or modernize the works of earlier periods seems just as absurd for a musician to make as it would be for an architect, for example, to place a Corinthian capital on the columns of an Egyptian temple.” But he soon fell off the wagon and went back to crowd-wowing revisions, reports Kenneth Hamilton in his mesmerizing study of Romantic pianism, After the Golden Age. Over the course of the nineteenth century, the concept of a musical canon emerged and displaced the zeal for new music in concert programming. Yet the updating of scores continued. Gustav Mahler added new parts for horns, trombones, and other instruments when he conducted Beethoven’s symphonies. An influential edition of Beethoven’s piano sonatas by the pianist and conductor Hans von Bülow recommended that pianists substitute Liszt’s ending of the Hammerklavier Sonata for Beethoven’s own, “to give the closing measures the requisite brilliancy.” Even in the canon-revering twentieth century, the teleologists remained cheeky. Arnold Schoenberg explained his reorchestration of Handel’s Concerti Grossi, op. 6, as remedying an “insufficiency with respect to thematic invention and development [that] could satisfy no sincere contemporary of ours.” At the start of a 1927 recording of Chopin’s Black Key Étude, the pianist Vladimir de Pachmann announces: “The left hand of this étude is entirely altered from Chopin: it’s better, modernized, more melodic, you know.” A contemporary listener, drawn to Beethoven, Handel, and Chopin precisely for what is unique in their voice and sensibility, can only marvel at the confidence with which earlier generations declared such music in need of improvement. In the second half of the twentieth century, a performance practice broke out that rejected, in the strongest possible way, the teleological understanding of music. An overwhelming drive possessed certain conductors, instrumentalists, and singers to re-create the music of the pre-Classical era—from the medieval through the baroque periods—as it was performed at the time of its composition. These musicians discarded the modern steel-strung and -armatured instruments that had evolved in the nineteenth century and learned to play the gut-strung, fragile instruments of the Renaissance and baroque periods. They pored over music treatises, prints, and other historical materials to discover, say, how a seventeenth-century violinist attacked his instrument, how he handled the shorter, curved bow of the period, how he phrased and ornamented a line, how much vibrato he used. Needless to say, any thought of “modernizing” a score’s harmonies or orchestration was out of the question. These history-obsessed musicians didn’t want to bring the music of the past into the present; they wanted to enter the past on its own terms. The stylistic particularities of older music that, according to the teleologists, limited its potential, were for these revolutionaries its very essence. The results were a revelation. The sound of these performances of Bach, Handel, and Vivaldi was light and nuanced; the music pulsed with energy. Trading the large modern orchestra for small baroque ensembles of temperamental instruments was like exchanging a leather-upholstered Cadillac for a frisky, unbroken colt. The premodern horns—unreliable and highly prone to indiscretions—blared out with a glorious astringency. The timpani shot from the orchestra with hair-raising force. Conductors emphasized the dance elements in baroque music, inflecting certain beats within measures as a courtier might beckon to his dance partner. An unfamiliar and seductive voice—the countertenor—emerged to take on roles in baroque operas and masses that castrati originally sang. This “early-music” movement (also known as “period-instrument” and “authentic-performance”) was a deliberate strike against the classical-music establishment. It provoked a counterreaction and a sharp philosophical debate about the nature of performance and the proper role of historical knowledge in music-making (see box). Listeners and performers remain divided over whether the music of Bach and Mozart is best realized by a nineteenth-century-era orchestra using contemporary methods of expression (violinist Itzhak Perlman maintains: “I’m certain Haydn and Mozart would have adored our modern approach to phrasing and vibrato”) or by a small period-instrument ensemble seeking to re-create earlier performance techniques. But regardless of such disagreements, the value of the movement to our musical life has been indisputable. It has unleashed arguably the most concentrated rediscovery of lost music in history. Composers that had lain silent for centuries—Jean-Féry Rebel, Johann Friedrich Fasch, Heinrich Ignaz Biber, to name just a handful—are heard again. Hundreds of groups of specialists are busily digging into twelfth-century plainchant and thirteenth-century troubadour traditions. Unfamiliar repertoire by overly familiar composers is also being restored. The Naïve label, in one of the greatest recording projects of the early-music movement, is releasing all of Vivaldi’s operas. A wind blows through these magnificent, mostly unpublished works, but even when the rhythms are most propulsive, a deep melancholy pervades the music. Naïve’s recording of the haunting duet for mezzo and chalumeau (a proto-clarinet) from the oratorio Juditha Triumphans, “Veni, me sequere fida,” is alone a contribution to civilization. The public’s ear for this music has expanded accordingly. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, a few aristocratic salons hosted private performances of Renaissance and early baroque music, but outside those elite settings, there was no commercial demand for pre-Classical music. Today, by contrast, enough people are eager for works from remote eras to put the medieval a cappella ensemble Anonymous 4 on the top of Billboard charts. Jordi Savall’s Renaissance music group Hesperion XXI brings audience members to their feet during performances. Early-music festivals have even reached Missoula, Montana, where Heinrich Schütz’s Musikalisches Exequien was performed in March 2010, and Indianapolis, which offered Spanish ballads from the time of Cervantes in June 2010. The New York vocal group Polyhymnia invites its audience to “glimpse behind the tapestried walls of the ducal court at Munich, to hear the psalms kept for the private use of their patron,” assuming in their listeners the same desire to know the past that animates the performers themselves. Amateurs also perform this previously discarded music. Camps teaching medieval chant are ubiquitous, from Evansville, Indiana, to Litchfield, Connecticut. Reed, viol, and lute players can brush up on their skills at the Summer Texas Toot in Austin; San Jose, California, hosts a workshop for recorder players. The movement has also demolished one tiresome credo of classical-music critics: that the way to revitalize the concert tradition is to program contemporary music. It is surely the case that the concert repertoire, derived from a narrow slice of the musical universe, is in desperate need of new music. But the critics are wrong in defining “new music” exclusively as contemporary. The public could not be more unequivocal: it finds little emotional significance in most contemporary classical music, especially that produced in academic enclaves. The early-music movement offers two alternative definitions of “new music”: the standard repertoire, such as Mozart’s symphonies, performed in entirely new ways; and unknown repertoire from the pre-Classical period. Though the reinterpretation of the standard repertoire has had the biggest commercial impact, it is the second definition of “new music” that should animate concert programming today. Countless compelling works, not just from the pre-Classical period, cry out for rediscovery: Haydn’s Sturm und Drang symphonies, Dvořák’s piano music, and virtually unknown composers such as Zdeněk Fibich. Thousands of listeners, frustrated by the constricted concert canon, would eagerly support the performance of unknown old music. The Early-Music Quarrel By the mid-twentieth century, nearly all performers respected the letter of the score and dedicated themselves to realizing its spirit as well. But to the early-music advocates, the establishment musicians seriously misunderstood that spirit, at least regarding the pre-Classical repertoire. Over the course of the twentieth century, the baroque composers—above all, Bach and Handel—had been taking on more and more weight and waddling ever more ponderously, as mainstream conductors assimilated them to late-Romantic performance styles. Early-eighteenth-century works sounded suspiciously Wagnerian—with long legato lines and a smooth, creamy sound, performed by ensembles many magnitudes larger than anything ever marshaled during the baroque or classical eras. Conductor Ivan Fischer recently recalled a Leopold Stokowski performance of Bach, after which musicians left the stage to pare down for Bruckner, the epitome of late-Romantic gigantism. While massive ensembles may have magnified the spiritual force of the music for some listeners, the orchestral inflation at the very least obscured the intricate contrapuntal writing for different instrumental voices. With a chorus of 200, no one is going to hear the flutes delicately doubling the sopranos’ line in a Bach oratorio. In rejecting this supersized sound, the early-music acolytes (whose first modern wave included Gustav Leonhardt, Frans Brüggen, Nikolas Harnoncourt, Ton Koopman, and Christopher Hogwood) embraced a fallen historical consciousness, compared with the prelapsarian innocence of mainstream musicians. (The authenticity movement had late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century antecedents, but those early experiments never achieved critical mass.) Where the great titans of traditional twentieth-century performance—conductors such as Wilhelm Fürtwangler and Otto Klemperer—assumed a continuity between the past and the present that guaranteed the fidelity of their interpretations, the early-music advocates saw discontinuity. The essence of the music of the past was no longer intuitively available to us but required historical research to recover, they believed. A gulf separated Bach’s world from ours; we could no longer assume that modern performing traditions expressed his intentions. The early-music movement quickly attained commercial success and just as quickly provoked a backlash, primarily from musicians who objected to the implication that their performances were inauthentic. Some objections were aesthetic: these old instruments sound weak and thin, critics said; stronger models have superseded them for good reason. We need a revival of period strings as much as we need a revival of period dentistry, one wag observed. In a 1990 interview, violinist Pinchas Zuckerman called historical performance “asinine STUFF . . . a complete and absolute farce. Nobody wants to hear that stuff.” Other objections were normative. “Musical archaism may be a symptom of a disintegrating civilization,” musicologist Donald Grout wrote at the start of the modern period-instrument movement. A composer of early music, if he came back to life today, would be astonished by our interest in how music was performed in his own times, Grout asserted. “Have we no living tradition of music, that we must be seeking to revive a dead one?” the composer would ask. The most interesting challenges to the historical-performance movement, however, have been philosophical. Historically accurate performance is unattainable, critics like Richard Taruskin of the University of California at Berkeley charged. There are too many stylistic unknowns, too many variables regarding tempo and phrasing, to think that treatises on technique or illustrations of musicians playing an instrument can lead to the movement’s Holy Grail: the way a piece sounded at its creation. Further, the very idea of an authentic performance is incoherent, the skeptics said: Which performance of a work should we view as authentic? Its premiere? But what if that performance—or every subsequent one during a composer’s lifetime—failed to realize the composer’s conception because of inadequate rehearsals or mediocre musicians, as Berlioz so frequently experienced? The naysayers pointed out that the context of musical performance has changed so radically from the pre-Romantic era that we cannot hope to re-create its original meaning. For most of European history, music belonged to social ritual, whether it accompanied worship, paid homage to a king, or provided background for a feast. A large concert hall filled with silent listeners, focused intently on an ensemble of well-fed professionals still in possession of most of their teeth, has no counterpart in early-music history. Early-music proponents, the detractors added, are highly selective in their use of historical evidence. No one today conducts the operas of Jean-Baptiste Lully, for example, by pounding a staff on the floor, as conductors did in the court of Louis XIV to try to keep time in an ensemble of less-than-perfectly trained musicians. Taruskin launched the intended coup de grâce. The predominant early-music style has nothing to do with historical evidence, he charged, and everything to do with the modernist aesthetic. The style’s fleet rhythms and transparent textures are a reaction against the excesses of subjectivity and expression characteristic of Romanticism; the shaky historical arguments on its behalf are just after-the-fact window dressing. Several of the arguments against the period-instrument movement had bite. They reflect the skepticism regarding the possibility of knowing the past that dominates today’s universities and that gets used (improperly) to justify junking the study of history, philology, and literary tradition. The proponents of period performance heard and considered these sophisticated objections. Then something wonderful happened. They responded, in essence: “Yeah, whatever.” They tweaked their rhetoric, junked the term “authenticity” and anything else that sounded too authoritarian—and went right on doing what they had been doing all along. That is because their hunger for the past—for discovering how the musicians at the Esterházy palace interpreted crescendi or how much vibrato a cellist performing Bach’s cello suites in the 1720s would have used—was so great that no amount of hermeneutical skepticism could extinguish it. The influential restorer of French baroque opera, conductor William Christie, exemplifying this attitude, lamented in 1997 how little we know about the hand gestures used in ballets and operas in pre-Revolutionary France. Gestural art is “a field that is painful for me right now,” he told Bernard Sherman in Inside Early Music. Christie’s pain is precious. It comes from an instinct in short supply in the rest of the culture: the belief that the past contains lost worlds of expression that would enrich us if we could just recover them. The desire to learn how a shepherdess in a Rameau opera may have inclined her hand to Cupid is an attribute of an enlightened humanity. (Unfortunately, Christie has since abandoned the project of re-creating baroque opera stagings and choreography, leaving the Boston Early Music Festival and Opera Lafayette as the sole ensembles committed to courtly theatrical sensibility as well as musical practice.) An early informal truce between modern-instrument ensembles and the historicists has long since broken down. According to this unwritten understanding, the historicists would claim the pre-1800 repertoire, while leaving nineteenth-century works to the modern symphony orchestra. It was not long, however, before the proponents of historical “authenticity” marched all the way into the twentieth century, blithely piling one historical anachronism onto another, as if to confirm Taruskin’s skepticism regarding the evidentiary basis for their work. Period-instrument groups such as the Philharmonia Baroque and the Orchestre Révolutionnaire et Romantique use the evocative Waldhorn in Brahms’s works, for example, even though Brahms himself could not persuade his contemporary brass players to give up their spiffy new valved horn for that difficult ancient instrument. In addition to adopting “historical” practices that didn’t exist, the historicists ignore widespread nineteenth-century performance traditions that did exist. There has been no movement to revive “preluding,” for example, in which a pianist improvised chords and arpeggios before breaking into the actual published score of a work, because such behavior would too forcefully violate contemporary concert norms. Nor has the habit of teleologically updating scores been adopted. This paradox points to the conceptual meltdown point of the authenticity movement, where it becomes clear that the most unhistorical practice in the history of music is the concern for authenticity. Such conundrums do not subtract from the enormous contribution that the early-music movement has made to our experience of music. Traditional orchestras, especially in Europe, have subtly changed their sound and approach to the standard repertoire in response to the competition. Sadly, we will never know whether the period-instrument movement has come close to past performance style (though Taruskin is wrong that historical materials cannot provide meaningful guidance). But the effort to recover our musical past remains a noble one. The caliber of musicianship also marks our age as a golden one for classical music. “When I was young, you knew when you heard one of the top five American orchestras,” says Arnold Steinhardt, the first violinist of the recently disbanded Guarneri Quartet. “Now, you can’t tell. Every orchestra is filled with fantastic players.” Steinhardt is ruthless toward his students when they’re preparing for an orchestra audition. “I’ll tell them in advance: ‘You didn’t get the job. There are 250 violinists competing for that place. You have to play perfectly, and you sure didn’t play perfectly for me.’ ” The declinists who proclaim the death of classical music might have a case if musical standards were falling. But in fact, “the professional standards are higher everywhere in the world compared to 20 or 40 years ago,” says James Conlon, conductor of the Los Angeles Opera. A vast oversupply of students competing to make a career in music drives this increase in standards. Much of that student oversupply comes from Asia. “The technical proficiency of the pianists from Asia is staggering,” says David Goldman, a board member at New York’s Mannes College of Music, where applications are at a record high. “They arrive here with these Popeye arms, and never miss a note.” Asia has fallen in love with classical music; many parents believe that music training is an essential part of their children’s development. “The only way to survive when you’re in a pool of literally hundreds of thousands of other Asian kids is to outwork your competition,” says Tom Vignieri, the music producer of the effervescent NPR show From the Top, which showcases school-age classical musicians. Far Eastern countries are trying to build up their own conservatory system to meet the demand for music training—Robert Dodson, head of the Boston University School of Music, recalls with awe the Singapore Conservatory’s 200,000 square feet of marble—but so far, demand outstrips supply. When Lang Lang, today an internationally acclaimed pianist, was admitted to Beijing’s Central Conservatory in the early 1990s, he was one of 3,000 students who had applied for just 12 fifth-grade spots. And those 3,000 were the cream of the 50 million children who study music in China, including 36 million young pianists. For now, the West’s conservatories continue to attract Asia’s top talent. Nineteen-year-old Meng-Sheng Shen, a slender freshman at Juilliard, dreamed of a concert career while still a piano student in Taiwan. “In Taiwan, I felt: ‘It’s not that hard to win,’ ” he says. In New York, however, “you see a lot of people who play really well,” Shen marvels, and so this acolyte of Chopin, Liszt, and Rachmaninoff has recalibrated his plans to include the option of teaching as well as concertizing. Plenty of young Americans, too, are pursuing training in the nation’s 600-plus college music programs, whose unlikely locations, such as at California State University, Fresno, testify to the far-flung desire for musical sublimity. An efficient talent-spotting machine vacuums up promising young oboists and violinists from every Arkansas holler and Oregon farm town and propels them to ever-higher levels of instruction and competition. The poise and exuberance of these budding performers can be breathtaking. At the 2007 finals for the Metropolitan Opera’s National Council Auditions, a young tenor’s eyes shone with the erotic power of commanding that massive house, a smile of mastery playing over his lips, as he flung out the high Cs of “Ah! mes amis” from Donizetti’s La Fille du Regiment. (The moment was captured in the documentary The Audition.) A self-possessed black pianist from Chicago, Jeremy Jordan, coolly unfurled the feathery arpeggios and midnight harmonies of his own virtuosic transcriptions of Wagner, Richard Strauss, and Saint-Saëns at a Juilliard student recital this year. Beneath Jordan’s laconic demeanor lies a deep belief in classical music. “It’s not as if kids don’t like music like this,” the lanky 20-year-old insists. “Liszt, Wagner, Chopin—it’s beautiful; it just takes one hearing.” But however vibrant classical music’s supply side, many professionals worry that audience demand is growing ever more anemic. Conlon calls this imbalance the “American paradox”: “The growth in the quantity and quality of musicians over the last 50 years is phenomenal. America has more great orchestras than any country in the world. And yet I don’t know of a single orchestra, opera company, or chamber group that isn’t fighting to keep its audience.” The number of Americans over the age of eight who attended a classical-music performance dropped 29 percent from 1982 to 2008, according to the League of American Orchestras (though attendance at all leisure activities plummeted during that period as well, including a 36 percent drop in attendance at sporting events). Recent conservatory graduates, struggling for work, find their commitment to a music career tested almost daily. “The culture seems to have a shrinking capacity for what I love,” says Jennifer Jackson, a 30-year-old pianist who studied at the Peabody Institute in Baltimore. The audience has a limited ability to follow serious music, Jackson says. “To make a profit, you have to intersperse lots of things that people can handle musically.” These perceptions, however valid, should be kept in historical perspective. Much of today’s standard repertoire was never intended for a mass audience—not even an 1820s Viennese “mass audience,” much less a 2010 American one. Nineteenth-century performers regarded the music that constitutes the foundation of today’s repertoire with trepidation, since they feared—rightly at the time—that it would prove too challenging for the public. Composers wrote sonatas and chamber works either for students or for private performance in aristocratic salons, not for public consumption. True public concerts—those intended to make a profit—resembled The Ed Sullivan Show, not the reverential communing with greatness that we take for granted today. Light crowd-pleasers—above all, variations on popular opera themes—leavened more serious works, which were unlikely to be performed in their entirety or without a diverting interruption. At the 1806 premiere of Beethoven’s Violin Concerto in Vienna, the violinist played one of his own compositions between the concerto’s first and second movements—on one string while holding his violin upside down. Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony premiered at Paris’s leading concert venue in 1832 with romances and tunes by Weber and Rossini spliced between the third movement and the choral finale, according to James Johnson in Listening in Paris. By the end of the nineteenth century, public concert practice more closely resembled the norm today, with symphonies and sonatas usually performed in their entirety and without other works spliced into them. Many soloists began performing marathon recitals of highly demanding works. This programming of exclusively serious music for public consumption in the late nineteenth century was no more consistent with how that music was originally performed than it is now, and it represented as much of an unforeseen advance in the listening capacities of the public. Today’s classical-music culture differs from the past in one more important way: recording technology. No composer before the advent of the gramophone ever anticipated that his music would be endlessly and effortlessly repeatable. At best, he might hope that his musician friends would give a few additional performances of his latest piece before new styles and works superseded it. The ease of repetition that recording technology enabled puts an enormous strain on the excessively li mited canon that emerged from the nineteenth century—one that could have proved fatal. Yet not only have Schubert’s piano sonatas and Chopin’s nocturnes, Beethoven’s string quartets and Brahms’s intermezzi, survived the move from the private salon to the public concert hall; they have triumphed over the potentially stupefying overfamiliarity inflicted on them by instant replay and the accumulating weight of hundreds of thousands of performances. The exquisiteness of this music is such that it continues to seduce, decades and centuries after its expected eclipse. The radical transformation of how people consume classical music puts the current hand-wringing over an inattentive, shrinking audience in a different perspective. Beethoven’s Eroica Symphony premiered before an audience of 100 at most. These days, probably 10,000 people are listening to it during any given 24-hour period, either live or on record, estimates critic Harvey Sachs. Recordings have expanded the availability of music in astounding ways. The declinists—led by the industry’s most reliable Cassandra, the League of American Orchestras—do not account for how recordings have changed the concert culture beyond recognition. Recordings have also, it is true, taken a toll on the communal, participatory aspect of music-making. But the explosion of classical music on the Internet has revived some of that communal element. The ever-expanding offerings of performances on YouTube, uploaded simply out of love, demonstrate the passion that unites classical-music listeners. A listener can compare 15 different interpretations of “Là ci darem la mano” at the click of a mouse, all—amazingly—for free. Organized websites, such as the live classical-concert site InstantEncore.com, are creating new ways of disseminating music that will undoubtedly reach new audiences. Even with recording technology’s impetus for passive, private listening, the percentage of amateur musicians studying classical music has risen 30 percent over the last six years, from an admittedly small 1.8 percent to 3 percent. Many of those nonprofessional musicians, as well as their children, are uploading their own performances onto the Web. Contrary to the standard dirge, the classical recording industry is still shooting out more music than anyone can possibly take in over a lifetime. Has the pace of Beethoven symphony cycles slowed down? We’ll survive. In the course of one month arrive arias by Nicola Porpora, an opera by Federico Ricci, a symphony by Ildebrando Pizzetti—three composers previously known only to musicologists—Cherubini’s Chant sur la Mort de Joseph Haydn, and Haydn’s The Storm. This cornucopia of previously lost works is more than any of us has a right to hope for. The much-publicized financial difficulties of many orchestras during the current recession also need to be put into historical perspective. More people are making a living playing an instrument than ever before, and doing so as respected and well-paid professionals, not lowly drones. There were no professional orchestras during Beethoven’s time; he had to cobble together an ensemble for the premiere of his Ninth Symphony. Even mid-twentieth-century America had no year-round, salaried orchestras. In 1962, most concert seasons were half a year long. But under pressure from an increasingly militant musicians’ union and with an infusion of funding from the Ford Foundation in 1966, many orchestras started paying their players annual, or close to annual, salaries. In part to justify those higher salaries, orchestras expanded their concert seasons and the frequency of concerts within each season. Neither Beethoven nor Brahms envisioned that a single orchestra would perform three or four concerts a week, critic Joseph Horowitz notes in Classical Music in America, much less that its members would draw six-figure salaries. The low pay of a typical late-nineteenth-century musician made possible the huge orchestral forces that Bruckner and Mahler summoned as a matter of course. Today’s composers usually write for much smaller ensembles, having been priced out of the symphonic form by unionized wages. Nevertheless, professional orchestras in the U.S. today dwarf in number anything seen in the past. In 1937, there were 96 American orchestras; in 2010, there are more than 350. Where union restrictions don’t exist, the music scene is even more vibrant. Volunteer adult orchestras outnumber professional orchestras two to one. New youth ensembles launch every year; there are now nearly 500 in the United States. Though Los Angeles County alone has more than 40 youth orchestras, the leading state in student involvement is Texas, where more than 57,000 high school musicians auditioned last year for slots in prestigious all-state music ensembles. Chamber-music groups have also proliferated in the last 50 years. Arnold Steinhardt recalls that back when he was studying the violin, you could count on one hand the number of string quartets and other ensembles: “Chamber music was not a profession then; it was for people who weren’t good enough to have a solo career.” Nowadays, new quartets form constantly, many associated with colleges and universities. It took nearly the entire nineteenth century for the string-quartet repertoire to broaden its appeal beyond a narrow band of connoisseurs; today, the audience for chamber music extends far beyond traditional urban centers of culture. Iowa City hosted a Haydn quartet “slam” last year in honor of the 200th anniversary of the composer’s death. String players from ages eight to 78 performed all 83 of Haydn’s quartets. It is fair to ask whether the foundation-fueled postwar expansion of orchestras artificially and unsustainably pumped up the supply of musicians and ensembles. But there is ample evidence of a continuing unmet demand for classical music throughout the country—especially in places that can’t afford the salaries and long seasons that America’s unionized musicians expect. This March, the New York Times’s invaluable Daniel Wakin chronicled the travails of the Moscow State Radio Symphony Orchestra as it slogged through a poorly paid nine-week bus tour to smaller cities and towns around America—places like Ashland, Kentucky, and Zanesville, Ohio, which are “hungry for classical music programming.” It’s even harder to spot a demand deficit at the other end of the glamour spectrum. Though Wagner fans incessantly lament the shortage of Heldentenors, the source of the problem is not a decrease in capable Siegfrieds and Tristans but the mushrooming of Ring cycles in China, Russia, and Japan, among other locales. Likewise, as Plácido Domingo explains in a collection of interviews called Living Opera, hand-wringing about singers who find themselves pushed too early into roles for which they are not yet ready reflects the worldwide increase in theaters and opera companies, which require a constant supply of singers. However bounteous today’s classical-music culture is for those already inside it, the number of children who have the opportunity to be captivated by classical music is still much lower than it ought to be. “The arts fell out of U.S. schools in the 1980s; all the music is gone,” James Conlon observes in Living Opera. “Now we have a generation of adults who make money, accomplish what they think is the fulfillment of life, but they’ve never had any contact with the classical arts—neither music nor literature. For me that’s a national disgrace.” Most leading music institutions have energetic outreach programs to try to compensate for the loss of public music education. But some school bureaucracies make no effort to accommodate these programs. The public schools’ sclerosis has fueled the growth of community music schools that offer low-cost private lessons and ensemble work to children and their parents. The schools, heirs to the music program for immigrants at Chicago’s Hull House, are particularly important in urban areas, where arts education has withered far more than in suburban and rural school districts. Philadelphia’s buoyant network of schools trains thousands of students each year. Such endeavors could reach far more children if they enjoyed better funding. That will require changing the priorities of America’s patron class, says Leon Botstein, the president of Bard College and conductor of the American Symphony Orchestra. “What is different today is that the nation’s elite, the very rich, don’t care about classical music,” he observes. “The patron class is philistine; instead of Andrew Carnegie, we have Donald Trump. Some rich guy with a hedge fund wants to be photographed with Angelina Jolie, not support the Cleveland Orchestra.” Bill Gates didn’t help matters when he proclaimed gratuitously: “I have no interest in giving to opera houses.” Younger philanthropists seem to be following Gates’s lead in spurning the arts, write Matthew Bishop and Michael Green in Philanthrocapitalism. The celebrity-bedecked Robin Hood Foundation enjoys extraordinary cachet on Wall Street; organizations that promote classical culture, far less so. Two of the best hopes for building future American audiences may come from outside the country. Gustavo Dudamel, the 29-year-old Venezuelan conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, is the closest thing the classical-music world has to a Leonardo DiCaprio. His tousle-headed exuberance, thousand-watt smile, and undoubted conducting skills have thrilled the press and public and created huge interest in his future career. But it is Dudamel’s past that may be his most important contribution to classical music. Dudamel is the most famous graduate of Venezuela’s initiative to teach slum children to play classical instruments, and in so doing to develop the self-discipline that will carry them out of the ghetto. More than a quarter-million poor children in Venezuela enroll in the nearly 200 youth orchestras that belong to El Sistema Nacional de las Orquestas Juveniles e Infantiles de Venezuela (“El Sistema,” for short). In 2002, another El Sistema graduate, the double bassist Edicson Ruiz, became at 17 the youngest musician ever to join the Berlin Philharmonic. The brainchild of José Antonio Abreu, a left-wing economist committed to “social justice,” El Sistema could not be a stronger rebuke to the multicultural dogma that currently governs American education and welfare programs. Its premise is that all children should be exposed to the West’s highest artistic accomplishments. “The huge spiritual world that music produces in itself ends up overcoming material poverty,” Abreu has said. “From the minute a child is taught how to play an instrument, he’s no longer poor.” Dudamel’s charisma and hip Latino ethos could make it safe for Silicon Valley moguls to fund classical-music education without worrying about accusations of elitism. Perhaps the sight of Venezuela’s Simón Bolivar Youth Orchestra playing its heart out could persuade even the liberal Ford Foundation to return to its roots in classical arts funding. “We have lived our whole lives inside these pieces,” Dudamel says. “When we play Beethoven’s Fifth, it is the most important thing happening in the world.” Thanks to the publicity around L.A.’s new conductor, an initiative headquartered at the New England Conservatory of Music now trains music postgraduates to start local El Sistema programs worldwide. But much more could be done. Why not a Play for America program, modeled on Teach for America, that would send music graduates into poor communities to teach and perform for two or three years? The other source of future classical-music demand is China. “I’m very hopeful,” says Robert Sirota, head of the Manhattan School of Music. “If China graduates 100,000 pianists a year, it changes everything.” The best predictor of attendance at classical concerts is playing an instrument. Asia’s passionate pursuit of music training for its children will create not just tomorrow’s professional musicians, of whom there is no dearth, but tomorrow’s audiences as well. And like El Sistema, the phenomenon of countless poor young Asians practicing fanatically for the privilege of a career performing Scarlatti and Rachmaninoff torpedoes the image of classical music as the bastion of wealthy white elites. When the 12-year-old Lang Lang competed for the first time with Europeans, he worried that their heritage would give them an interpretive advantage. “It’s your native music as well,” his father reminded him. “It belongs to anyone who loves it.” Music records the evolution of the human soul. To hear how the elegance of the baroque developed into the grandeur of the classical style, which in turn gave way to the languid sensuality and unbridled passion of Romanticism, is to trace how variously human beings have expressed longing, desire, triumph, and sorrow over the centuries. Not everyone will hear that changing sensibility; some may find the soul’s echo elsewhere. But the present-day abundance of classical music—of newly rediscovered works, consummate performances, thousands of recordings, and legions of fans—is a testament to its deep roots in human feeling. And it is a cause for celebration that so many people still feel drawn into its web of lethal beauty, in a world so far from the one that gave it birth.

"Skip to content Agence France-Presse  July 27, 2010 · 10:51 AM UTC NEW DELHI, India — Dressed in a long, orange kurta, orange pajamas and a bright orange turban, Swami Agnivesh looks every bit the haranguing fanatic. But India's latest televangelist is cut from a different cloth. In a forest of Rush Limbaugh-style conservatives, Agnivesh is the sole voice of India's fast-fading social liberalism on TV. Or was. The crusader has just been canceled. ""From March 1968 till today I've been deeply involved with the struggle of the people, with the main focus on issues of social justice,"" Agnivesh said. ""I felt that in order to consolidate an ideological perspective around these movements, struggles, agitations, which are all directed towards social change, I need a platform by which I can reach millions of viewers and engage them in discussion, debate and dialogue."" At 74 years old, Agnivesh speaks with a quiet, measured voice. As the president of the World Council of Arya Samaj — an affiliate of the Hindu reform movement that was founded in the 19th century to eradicate the caste system — his ""sermons"" are as much about politics as they are about religion. Frustrated with religious leaders' opaque platitudes and increasingly commercial bent, not to mention the news channels' preference for shouting matches featuring the same old rogue gallery of party hacks, he set out to open substantive debates about the causes underlying caste discrimination, illiteracy, poverty, corruption and more. And he did it by passing the microphone to people whose voices had never been heard on Indian TV: including the Dalits who scrape human excrement from primitive toilets for a living, AIDS patients and lepers. ""We got an extensive response, not only through letters and emails,"" said Agnivesh. ""But in my travels throughout the length and breadth of the country, people would walk up to me, shake hands and talk about the latest episode. I could see from their faces that it was impacting the minds of the people."" An ascetic who took monastic orders in 1970, Agnivesh is most famous for his decades-long fight against bonded labor. But he has also crusaded against female feticide, the liquor mafia and sati — a practice in which widows are encouraged, or forced, to immolate themselves on their deceased husbands' funeral pyres. On TV, he adopted the talk show format to send out his message for 52 episodes, playing devil's advocate instead of preaching. ""The strength of this program was that we took up issues that were not being taken up by the mainstream media and demonstrated through this talk show that there is more than one side to the truth,"" Agnivesh said. There were some of the usual hijinks, too, of course. He theatrically touched the feet of a Dalit woman on one episode. But what was striking about the show was that he encouraged his underprivileged guests to talk for themselves, rather than banging on for them. The fact that the government and the Maoists agreed to make him the go-between for peace negotiations in May — until his Maoist interlocutor was killed in controversial circumstances in June — is testament that he came off as fair, reasonable and honest. But fair, reasonable and honest doesn't sell. Agnivesh's message of social reform cuts against the grain in modernizing India, where the upwardly mobile masses are increasingly looking to conservative leaders to explain their new world. That's why his show first migrated from the state-owned general interest channel, Doordarshan, to Lok Sabha TV — a channel primarily dedicated to the live broadcast of parliament — and was eventually canceled, while his most prominent competitors continue to amass million-dollar television empires. ""[The new conservative evangelism] marries the notion of what the audience feels to be traditional with consumption and individualism,"" said Santosh Desai, a prominent media analyst and CEO of Future Brands. ""It sits really well with the Indian middle class, which is trying to make sense of the world around them. It assuages a lot of anxiety about change, by giving it a sort of spiritual sanctity."" Freed from state control in the 1990s, Indian cable has moved from soap operas to game shows to reality TV. Along the way, spiritual India's preoccupation with gods and gurus has inspired a bouquet of religious channels, too. They run the gamut from homegrown Sanskar TV, which broadcasts Hindu sermons and devotional music, to Power Vision, an all-God-all-the-time Christian channel that broadcasts in Hindi, Malayalam and English. But in contrast to bygone gurus like the Hare Krishna movement's Swami Prabhupada or Beatles inspiration Mahesh Yogi, who sought to explode and transform society, India's new preachers are essentially conservative protectors of tradition. And the biggest stars of televangelism are its most controversial ideologues: Hinduism's Baba Ramdev and Islam's Zakir Naik. Both televangelists appeal to a young, new India that's embracing commercialism and trying to make sense of a rapidly changing socio-economic landscape. Ramdev is more like self-help star Tony Robbins than Pat Robertson; he promises viewers tangible, individual benefits, like any brand, says Desai. Similarly, Naik offers an imminently practical and useful service for Muslims. ""He seems to have connected with the middle class Muslims ... [because] he tries to show that Islam is not incompatible with modern ideas,"" said Mujibur Rehman, a professor at New Delhi's Jamia Milia University. ""They are propagating themselves,"" said Agnivesh. ""With each show, they are getting a little more followers, a little more power in that sense and, also, a little more money."" Their self-promotion, if that's what it's all about, can take an ugly turn. After claiming simple breathing exercises could cure cancer and AIDS, Baba Ramdev drew liberal ire — and additional fans — by opposing India's progressive move to decriminalize homosexuality. He went on to claim he could turn any erring lad with his yogic arts, and promptly announced he was forming his own political party. For his part, Zakir Naik's opaque statements in support of terrorism and Osama bin Laden — though he claims they've been taken out of context — got him banned from entering the United Kingdom and Canada this June. Arguably, this is reactionary radicalism in the guise of the rational. Whether the effect is intentional or not, Naik's propensity for inflammatory statements like ""every Muslim should be a terrorist,"" make him a dangerous influence. And Ramdev's peddling of prejudice and superstition is perhaps more dangerous still in a country already flirting with Hindu fundamentalism. ""It's too much to say that Hindu right revivalism is directly linked to this, but certainly it softens up the audience for the revivalist agenda to some extent,"" said Desai. ""In that respect, although it's couched in the language of modern, it has the effect of the other kind."" Indeed, with every bombshell, India's conservative gurus have grown more popular. Ramdev's programs reportedly attract an audience of more than 85 million people, and his yoga and homeopathic medicines businesses bring in $40 million a year. Meanwhile, Naik claims an audience of 50 million for his program on Peace TV, and one of India's top newspapers ranks him the country's third-most powerful guru, after Ramdev and the Art of Living's Sri Sri Ravi Shankar. At the same time, Agnivesh's most radical statements helped get his show canceled. He didn't just call out the government on the Maoist issue. He came out against Hinduism's massively important kumbh mela — a ritual bath in the Ganges that attracts millions of pilgrims — and threatened to launch a Right to Information inquiry into the huge sums that the government spends on the celebration. And he pilloried Dalit leaders, like the present Congress Party speaker of the Lok Sabha, who rise to power based on their caste affiliation and then abandon the empowerment agenda for party politics.

"An Australian traditionalist conservative site Liberal ""guilt"" is the means by which liberals display benevolence. Rousseau in his Confessions acknowledged he was not a man of virtue, but claimed he was the most benevolent fellow in the world. This, notwithstanding he abandoned his five newbord children to foundling homes, effectively a death sentence in those days.Liberal benevolence is the ostentatious display of concern over suffering, which is caused by the shortcomings of others. Thus instead of the hard work of attending to one's own moral character, there is the easy satisfaction of indignation over the failings of others.Liberal guilt is in effect vanity. Maybe another way to look at it is this. If society says we all are given an equal opportunity to succeed, and if you don't you are inferior, then lurking at the back of your mind is the fear that you weren't actually all given an equal opportunity to succeed. Some parents are better than others, some people are given better chances, some people are born into better cultures. It's false to say that there are unconquerable barriers to progress but its also folly to say that we all have an equal chance or that it all comes down to innate intelligence. So a liberal will say, ok we don't all have an equal chance to be superior, but I am aware of that fact, ie I have liberal guilt, and my awareness of that makes me ""actually"" superior. A very common liberal view is that everything outside of the western world is a hell hole. Of course this isn't the case, but the concern or horror, as anonymous says, reinforces liberal vanity or superiority. The liberal guilt culture seems to be strongly related to the secularisation of Protestant theology.Its interesting how the countries at the vanguard of implementing egalitarianism and political correctness are Protestant nations (Canada, Sweden, New Zealand etc) and the nations that bend the rules a little (like Italy and Switzerland) have a strong Catholic or Eastern Orthodox tradition. My view is that the internalisation of guilt that is characteristic of Protestant theology has now been transformed into secular political correctness.This is why traits that characterised Protestant nations in the 1950s, like low crime and corruption, have started to erode, while the public display of political correctness has intensified.Three of the reasons why this transformation has occured:1. society has become more secular2. egalitarian ideology has been pushed by academia and the media3. society has become more extroverted. A more extroverted society aids the transmission of left liberal thinking and works against conservatism. Left liberal intellectuals and activists tend to be quite extroverted while rank and file liberals are introverts with a low profile, so liberalism is seen by the public as serious, middle class and intellectual. Conversely, educated conservatives tend to have introverted 'scientific' temperaments and are less visible to the general public, while rank and file conservatives tend to be anti-intellectual extroverts. Thus conservatism has an unserious anti-intellectual image, and the public face of conservatism tends to be people like Glenn Beck. The basic idea behind the modern left wing viewpoint is that if a person is rich in the west, and another is poor in the east, then the westerner must have ""stolen"" that wealth from the easterner.The idea that wealth grows unequally in societies based on their capacity to create it seems an alien notion to them.If there is only a limited amount of ""wealth"" in the world, and that ""wealth"" is all that truly matters, and all humans are born with a blank slate, and all cultures have the same relative good, and all ethnic groups are merely social constructs, then any inequality in the world is a crime on a massive scale.But if any of these assumptions are false then it is natural and nothing to feel guilt about. If liberal guilt is about resisting injustice, racism and prejudice, how come liberals are so astoundingly unjust, racist and prejudiced? I don't know, this almost seems like some sort of contradiction or something. Re Rousseau, it has been maintained (notably by Harold Nicolson in his study The Age of Reason) that Rousseau fathered no children at all. Certainly at some stages of his life he was sexually impotent, as a Venetian prostitute unkindly pointed out to him (she told him, on his own account, to ""leave the women and stick to mathematics""). So one may legitimately take the widespread ""five abandoned babies"" allegation with a grain of salt.As to the liberal death-wish / Protestantism connection, Paul Gottfried's books, notably Multiculturalism and the Politics of Guilt, acknowledge this and explain it in great detail. I recommend them to any reader of this website who hasn't already discovered them. I only feel pangs of conscience about things I actually did. I feel no guilt whatsoever about the supposed crimes of the white race from ancient time to the present day. That's nuts. I haven't enslaved anybody or colonized anybody, so I feel no personal remorse for those actions at all. V. Walter: To take the idea of Rousseau's abandonment of his children ""with a grain of salt,"" one has to ignore Rousseau's specific description of his doing this in the Confessions. So, on the one hand, we have Rousseau himself's testimony as to what he did, and on the other the speculation of a third party that he did not. This is ""legitimate?"" If enslaving and colonising helped my society to succeed then I don't feel guilty about it, rather I'm proud. This view can be made in the the knowledge that we were the most reasonable and beneficial enslavers and colonisers around. Additionally that as human life proceeds materially and socially (largely thanks to us) enslaving and colonising no longer become necessary.On the point about guilt, if guilt is a mechanism of group and social cohesion, then people in their individual state will always feel prey to it. Should we feel guilt for specific events that our forebears committed in the past?That's a somewhat different issue, I think, than feeling ""existential guilt"" as a default setting for the fact of unequal autonomy.If I identify closely enough with my communal group to feel pride in its historic achievements, then I don't think I can simply say ""well I wasn't there to do it"" when it comes to historic failures.I can certainly feel regret that certain events took place.If the overall aim is to carry forward or even improve the tradition, then I think it's OK to recognise where things might have gone wrong (as a means toward improvement) but not to dwell in a crippling, guilt-ridden way on such events (which works against carrying forward the tradition).Let's say you're a young Japanese man today. The Japanese committed some cruel war crimes in WWII. It's better to recognise that these took place, to express regret for them, and to think about why they happened (what was wrong with the mentality of the times?)But this shouldn't be dwelt on in a demoralising way - there is much within Japanese culture and history to generate pride and a positive identity and that has to remain at the forefront of consciousness.The problem white males have is that we are the target of a political campaign which portrays us as the ""cosmic enemy"" of humanity - the group which has held back the march to ""equal freedom"" through our racism, our sexism etc etc.At the school I teach at every book presented to the students and every film presents white males as evil oppressors. It is remorseless.It would be naive to respond to this with feelings of guilt. What is required is a political criticism of the liberalism which presents us as a cosmic enemy. Re Anonymous's remark at 4:47:00 AM AEST: it would be naive in the extreme, I should have thought, to give much evidentiary weight to otherwise unsupported statements in the Confessions. Santayana's remark on Rousseau's level of veracity is devastating:""If Rousseau, for instance, after writing those Confessions in which candour and ignorance of self are equally conspicuous, had heard some intelligent friend, like Hume, draw up in a few words an account of their author's true and contemptible character, he would have been loud in protestations that no such ignoble characteristics existed in his eloquent consciousness; and they might not have existed there, because his consciousness was a histrionic thing, and as imperfect an expression of his own nature as of man's. When the mind is irrational no practical purpose is served by stopping to understand it, because such a mind is irrelevant to practice, and the principles that guide the man's practice can be as well understood by eliminating his mind altogether.""And Orwell's remark about Salvador Dali's autobiography is pertinent to Rousseau:""Some of the incidents in it are flatly incredible, others have been rearranged and romanticised, and not merely the humiliation but the persistent ordinariness of everyday life has been cut out. Dali is even by his own diagnosis narcissistic, and his autobiography is simply a strip-tease act conducted in pink limelight."""
"by Martin Hamilton returns to his favorite theme in Federalist No. 11, the importance of maintaining a strong Union. His arguments in this essay center around the benefits to commerce, protection against foreign manipulation, and the ability of a United States government to form and maintain a navy. To the People of the State of New York: THE importance of the Union, in a commercial light, is one of those points about which there is least room to entertain a difference of opinion, and which has, in fact, commanded the most general assent of men who have any acquaintance with the subject. This applies as well to our intercourse with foreign countries as with each other. Almost everyone agrees on the importance of the Union from a commercial aspect. However, there are legitimate areas for discussion about how a prospective Union should interact with foreign countries and amongst its members. There are appearances to authorize a supposition that the adventurous spirit, which distinguishes the commercial character of America, has already excited uneasy sensations in several of the maritime powers of Europe. They seem to be apprehensive of our too great interference in that carrying trade, which is the support of their navigation and the foundation of their naval strength. Those of them which have colonies in America look forward to what this country is capable of becoming, with painful solicitude. They foresee the dangers that may threaten their American dominions from the neighborhood of States, which have all the dispositions, and would possess all the means, requisite to the creation of a powerful marine. Impressions of this kind will naturally indicate the policy of fostering divisions among us, and of depriving us, as far as possible, of an ACTIVE COMMERCE in our own bottoms. This would answer the threefold purpose of preventing our interference in their navigation, of monopolizing the profits of our trade, and of clipping the wings by which we might soar to a dangerous greatness. Did not prudence forbid the detail, it would not be difficult to trace, by facts, the workings of this policy to the cabinets of ministers. Apparently the adventurous spirit which characterizes the commercial activities of America has already alarmed several European maritime powers. They are apprehensive about competition with their trade. That trade is the support of their navigation and the foundation of their naval strength. Those countries with colonies in America are paying very close attention to what happens here and are aware of what this country is capable of becoming. They foresee the dangers that may threaten their American dominions posed by a power capable of creating a strong navy. America is not only capable, but also possessed of the means, inclination, and resources to do so. This is a powerful motivation for them to foster division among us, so as to weaken our ability to conduct trade in our own ships. Weakening us in this way would accomplish three benefits for them. First, it would reduce our interference in their navigation, second it would allow them monopolize the profits of our trade, and third by clipping the wings by which we might soar to a dangerous greatness. We don’t need to give them any ideas, but such a stratagem will doubtless occur to the cabinet ministers of these powers. If we continue united, we may counteract a policy so unfriendly to our prosperity in a variety of ways. By prohibitory regulations, extending, at the same time, throughout the States, we may oblige foreign countries to bid against each other, for the privileges of our markets. This assertion will not appear chimerical to those who are able to appreciate the importance of the markets of three millions of people — increasing in rapid progression, for the most part exclusively addicted to agriculture, and likely from local circumstances to remain so — to any manufacturing nation; and the immense difference there would be to the trade and navigation of such a nation, between a direct communication in its own ships, and an indirect conveyance of its products and returns, to and from America, in the ships of another country. Suppose, for instance, we had a government in America, capable of excluding Great Britain (with whom we have at present no treaty of commerce) from all our ports; what would be the probable operation of this step upon her politics? Would it not enable us to negotiate, with the fairest prospect of success, for commercial privileges of the most valuable and extensive kind, in the dominions of that kingdom? When these questions have been asked, upon other occasions, they have received a plausible, but not a solid or satisfactory answer. It has been said that prohibitions on our part would produce no change in the system of Britain, because she could prosecute her trade with us through the medium of the Dutch, who would be her immediate customers and paymasters for those articles which were wanted for the supply of our markets. But would not her navigation be materially injured by the loss of the important advantage of being her own carrier in that trade? Would not the principal part of its profits be intercepted by the Dutch, as a compensation for their agency and risk? Would not the mere circumstance of freight occasion a considerable deduction? Would not so circuitous an intercourse facilitate the competitions of other nations, by enhancing the price of British commodities in our markets, and by transferring to other hands the management of this interesting branch of the British commerce? If we remain united, we can counteract these harmful policies in a variety of ways. Through the regulation of trade uniformly throughout the States, we can play foreign powers against each other, forcing them to compete for the privilege of access to our markets. This is not idle speculation. The value of this access to a market of more than 3 million people who subsist largely on the basis of an agricultural economy and who are dependent on external sources for manufactured goods is not insignificant. Any manufacturing nation will benefit hugely from commerce with such a market. Suppose, for instance, we had a unified government capable of negotiating trade agreements and even perhaps excluding it from Great Britain (with whom we currently have no treaty of commerce), what would be the effect of such a thing on her politics? Would this not give us a tremendous advantage in negotiating for favorable terms in trade? Whenever such questions have been posed in the past, they’ve been answered in a plausible, but not a solid or satisfactory manner. Supposedly, any restrictions on trade imposed by us would merely be circumvented by Britain by them using the Dutch as an intermediary. Therefore, there would be no material change in British policies. However, isn’t it reasonable to suppose that her shipping business would be damaged by the loss of cargoes? Would it not be harmed by losing the advantage of being able to transport their own goods? Wouldn’t most of the profits of trade go to the Dutch as compensation for assuming the bulk of the risk associated with transport? Wouldn’t the fees associated with shipping amount to a considerable cost in and of themselves. The added costs from such a circumvention on their part would encourage others to try and compete for our business. A mature consideration of the objects suggested by these questions will justify a belief that the real disadvantages to Britain from such a state of things, conspiring with the pre-possessions of a great part of the nation in favor of the American trade, and with the importunities of the West India islands, would produce a relaxation in her present system, and would let us into the enjoyment of privileges in the markets of those islands elsewhere, from which our trade would derive the most substantial benefits. Such a point gained from the British government, and which could not be expected without an equivalent in exemptions and immunities in our markets, would be likely to have a correspondent effect on the conduct of other nations, who would not be inclined to see themselves altogether supplanted in our trade. Any thoughtful consideration of this matter will quickly lead to the conclusion that Britain, because of its own predisposition for trade with America, will not risk losing it. Consequently, seeing the inherent advantages of it, will likely allow us greater access to the West India islands, which are much more conveniently located for our commerce than hers. We would benefit substantially from such trade. Such a concession from Britain could not be obtained without negotiations. Other nations would necessarily offer concessions of their own in order not to be entirely cut off from the benefit of our trade. A further resource for influencing the conduct of European nations toward us, in this respect, would arise from the establishment of a federal navy. There can be no doubt that the continuance of the Union under an efficient government would put it in our power, at a period not very distant, to create a navy which, if it could not vie with those of the great maritime powers, would at least be of respectable weight if thrown into the scale of either of two contending parties. This would be more peculiarly the case in relation to operations in the West Indies. A few ships of the line, sent opportunely to the reinforcement of either side, would often be sufficient to decide the fate of a campaign, on the event of which interests of the greatest magnitude were suspended. Our position is, in this respect, a most commanding one. And if to this consideration we add that of the usefulness of supplies from this country, in the prosecution of military operations in the West Indies, it will readily be perceived that a situation so favorable would enable us to bargain with great advantage for commercial privileges. A price would be set not only upon our friendship, but upon our neutrality. By a steady adherence to the Union we may hope, erelong, to become the arbiter of Europe in America, and to be able to incline the balance of European competitions in this part of the world as our interest may dictate. The establishment of a federal navy would also strengthen our bargaining position with European nations. It’s easy to see that if the Union continues under an efficient government, it will be capable of fielding a respectable navy. This navy might not initially be able to contend with those of the more established maritime powers, but it might tilt the scale if applied to the benefit of one or the other. This is particularly germane to the West Indies theater of operations. It would only require a couple ships of the line to shift the balance of power, if those ships were judiciously applied to a campaign. The outcome of such a campaign in this region might be highly significant. This could give us quite a lot of influence. Furthermore, if one considers the value of materiel from this country to the conduct of any military operations in the West Indian theater, our commercial bargaining power is not inconsiderable. There would be a price on not only our friendship, but even for our neutrality. By maintaining a strong Union, we may be able to alter the balance European competition in our hemisphere to our best interest. But in the reverse of this eligible situation, we shall discover that the rivalships of the parts would make them checks upon each other, and would frustrate all the tempting advantages which nature has kindly placed within our reach. In a state so insignificant our commerce would be a prey to the wanton intermeddlings of all nations at war with each other; who, having nothing to fear from us, would with little scruple or remorse, supply their wants by depredations on our property as often as it fell in their way. The rights of neutrality will only be respected when they are defended by an adequate power. A nation, despicable by its weakness, forfeits even the privilege of being neutral. But, on the contrary, without a strong union, we will quickly find that the individual States would act as rivals and place checks upon each other. All of the advantages that nature has bestowed on us would be wasted. Because of the inherent insignificance of our divided commerce, it would be vulnerable to the whims of nations at war with each other. Having nothing to fear from us, they would, with little scruple or remorse, supply their wants by preying on our shipping whenever they saw fit to do so. The rights of neutrality will only be respected when they are defended by an adequate power. A nation, despicable by its weakness, forfeits even the privilege of being neutral. Under a vigorous national government, the natural strength and resources of the country, directed to a common interest, would baffle all the combinations of European jealousy to restrain our growth. This situation would even take away the motive to such combinations, by inducing an impracticability of success. An active commerce, an extensive navigation, and a flourishing marine would then be the offspring of moral and physical necessity. We might defy the little arts of the little politicians to control or vary the irresistible and unchangeable course of nature. However, under a strong national government, the natural advantages and resources of the country, directed to a common interest, would baffle all the alliances of European jealousy to restrain our growth. This situation would serve to discourage such alliances against us by virtue of the impracticality of their success. The fruits of a strong union would be robust commerce, extensive shipping, and a flourishing navy. But in a state of disunion, these combinations might exist and might operate with success. It would be in the power of the maritime nations, availing themselves of our universal impotence, to prescribe the conditions of our political existence; and as they have a common interest in being our carriers, and still more in preventing our becoming theirs, they would in all probability combine to embarrass our navigation in such a manner as would in effect destroy it, and confine us to a PASSIVE COMMERCE. We should then be compelled to content ourselves with the first price of our commodities, and to see the profits of our trade snatched from us to enrich our enemies and p rsecutors. That unequaled spirit of enterprise, which signalizes the genius of the American merchants and navigators, and which is in itself an inexhaustible mine of national wealth, would be stifled and lost, and poverty and disgrace would overspread a country which, with wisdom, might make herself the admiration and envy of the world. But, if we were in a state of disunion, such alliances might be quite successful. Maritime nations would like nothing better than to limit us to passive commerce. They would not hesitate to take advantage of our impotence to dictate the conditions of our political existence. They share a common interest in providing the transport for our trade and even more in preventing us from providing it for them. It is probable that they would ally together to weaken our merchant marine to prevent competition. In such a world, we would have to be content to be wholesalers. Most of the profits would be realized by our enemies and persecutors. The innate entrepreneurial spirit of competition which symbolizes American merchants and navigators, and which is an inexhaustible source of national wealth, would be wasted. The country would be relegated to poverty and disgrace instead of becoming the admiration of the world. There are rights of great moment to the trade of America which are rights of the Union — I allude to the fisheries, to the navigation of the Western lakes, and to that of the Mississippi. The dissolution of the Confederacy would give room for delicate questions concerning the future existence of these rights; which the interest of more powerful partners would hardly fail to solve to our disadvantage. The disposition of Spain with regard to the Mississippi needs no comment. France and Britain are concerned with us in the fisheries, and view them as of the utmost moment to their navigation. They, of course, would hardly remain long indifferent to that decided mastery, of which experience has shown us to be possessed in this valuable branch of traffic, and by which we are able to undersell those nations in their own markets. What more natural than that they should be disposed to exclude from the lists such dangerous competitors? There are certain rights pertaining to fisheries, the navigation of the Western lakes and to that of the Mississippi that are of critical importance to the Union. Its dissolution would leave room for a lot of ambiguity in the disposition of these rights. The interests of more powerful sovereignties would hold sway. Questions surrounding these rights would not be resolved in our favor. The situation with the Mississippi and Spain needs no elaboration. Both France and Britain compete with us in the fisheries and consider them of prime importance to their navigation. They would not be content to let us keep our current advantage in this business if they didn’t have to. They don’t particularly like being undersold in their own markets by us. What would be more natural than for them to try and displace us, and eliminate such a dangerous competitor if they could. This branch of trade ought not to be considered as a partial benefit. All the navigating States may, in different degrees, advantageously participate in it, and under circumstances of a greater extension of mercantile capital, would not be unlikely to do it. As a nursery of seamen, it now is, or when time shall have more nearly assimilated the principles of navigation in the several States, will become, a universal resource. To the establishment of a navy, it must be indispensable. This branch of trade ought not to be considered as a partial benefit. All the States with ocean access would benefit from a greater extension of mercantile capital. This trade might be thought of as a nursery of seamen. The combined shipping industries of several States will eventually become a universal resource and will be indispensable to the formation of a navy. To this great national object, a NAVY, union will contribute in various ways. Every institution will grow and flourish in proportion to the quantity and extent of the means concentred towards its formation and support. A navy of the United States, as it would embrace the resources of all, is an object far less remote than a navy of any single State or partial confederacy, which would only embrace the resources of a single part. It happens, indeed, that different portions of confederated America possess each some peculiar advantage for this essential establishment. The more southern States furnish in greater abundance certain kinds of naval stores — tar, pitch, and turpentine. Their wood for the construction of ships is also of a more solid and lasting texture. The difference in the duration of the ships of which the navy might be composed, if chiefly constructed of Southern wood, would be of signal importance, either in the view of naval strength or of national economy. Some of the Southern and of the Middle States yield a greater plenty of iron, and of better quality. Seamen must chiefly be drawn from the Northern hive. The necessity of naval protection to external or maritime commerce does not require a particular elucidation, no more than the conduciveness of that species of commerce to the prosperity of a navy. Union will contribute to the formation of a national navy in various ways. Every institution grows and flourishes in proportion to the resources that are devoted to it. A navy of the United States would leverage the combined resources of all the States. Whereas a navy of any single State or partial confederacy would be limited to the resources available to that part. As it happens, different resources are available in different areas of the continent. For instance, the more southern States have a greater abundance of tar, pitch and turpentine. The wood available in these States is also of a more solid and lasting texture. This wood is what makes naval ships last. Good quality iron is to be had in the Middle and some of the Southern States. However, seamen are a product of the northern regions. Just as the necessity of naval protection to maritime commerce, so is the reverse true – a merchant marine is essential to the formation of a navy. An unrestrained intercourse between the States themselves will advance the trade of each by an interchange of their respective productions, not only for the supply of reciprocal wants at home, but for exportation to foreign markets. The veins of commerce in every part will be replenished, and will acquire additional motion and vigor from a free circulation of the commodities of every part. Commercial enterprise will have much greater scope, from the diversity in the productions of different States. When the staple of one fails from a bad harvest or unproductive crop, it can call to its aid the staple of another. The variety, not less than the value, of products for exportation contributes to the activity of foreign commerce. It can be conducted upon much better terms with a large number of materials of a given value than with a small number of materials of the same value; arising from the competitions of trade and from the fluctations of markets. Particular articles may be in great demand at certain periods, and unsalable at others; but if there be a variety of articles, it can scarcely happen that they should all be at one time in the latter predicament, and on this account the operations of the merchant would be less liable to any considerable obstruction or stagnation. The speculative trader will at once perceive the force of these observations, and will acknowledge that the aggregate balance of the commerce of the United States would bid fair to be much more favorable than that of the thirteen States without union or with partial unions. Unrestrained interstate commerce will not only benefit the States in their respective industries to supply each others needs, but also help their exports to foreign markets. Commerce will be strengthened by the uninhibited circulation of the commodities of every part. The scope of commercial enterprise will be increased by the diversity of production in the States. A bad harvest need not be catastrophic as other crops may take its place. It is not only the value of the products, but their variety that contributes to a healthy foreign commerce. Having more products ensures protection against fluctuations in market value through wider variety. After all, particular articles may be in demand at some times and not at others. But, if there is a wide variety of products, it is highly unlikely that they would all fall out of favor at the same time. Because of this, a merchant would be less liable to the vagaries of the market. It should be obvious that the aggregate balance of commerce of the United States would be much better for all concerned than that of thirteen States without union or with partial unions. It may perhaps be replied to this, that whether the States are united or disunited, there would still be an intimate intercourse between them which would answer the same ends; this intercourse would be fettered, interrupted, and narrowed by a multiplicity of causes, which in the course of these papers have been amply detailed. A unity of commercial, as well as political, interests, can only result from a unity of government. In answer to this, some might say that regardless of whether the States are united or disunited, there would still be trade between them and that the end result would be the same. However, this is just not the case. In the end, intercourse between the states would be hampered, interrupted and limited for many reasons. These reasons have already been explained in previous papers. A unity of commercial, as well as political, interests, can only result from a unity of government. There are other points of view in which this subject might be placed, of a striking and animating kind. But they would lead us too far into the regions of futurity, and would involve topics not proper for a newspaper discussion. I shall briefly observe, that our situation invites and our interests prompt us to aim at an ascendant in the system of American affairs. The world may politically, as well as geographically, be divided into four parts, each having a distinct set of interests. Unhappily for the other three, Europe, by her arms and by her negotiations, by force and by fraud, has, in different degrees, extended her dominion over them all. Africa, Asia, and America, have successively felt her domination. The superiority she has long maintained has tempted her to plume herself as the Mistress of the World, and to consider the rest of mankind as created for her benefit. Men admired as profound philosophers have, in direct terms, attributed to her inhabitants a physical superiority, and have gravely asserted that all animals, and with them the human species, degenerate in America — that even dogs cease to bark after having breathed awhile in our atmosphere.1 Facts have too long supported these arrogant pretensions of the Europeans. It belongs to us to vindicate the honor of the human race, and to teach that assuming brother, moderation. Union will enable us to do it. Disunion will will add another victim to his triumphs. Let Americans disdain to be the instruments of European greatness! Let the thirteen States, bound together in a strict and indissoluble Union, concur in erecting one great American system, superior to the control of all transatlantic force or influence, and able to dictate the terms of the connection between the old and the new world! Although we could take this discussion into the realm of the distant future, and it would be interesting to do so, it is probably not appropriate for newspaper discussion. The topic at hand is of our current and near term potential. The world may politically, as well as geographically, be divided into four parts, each having a distinct set of interests. Unfortunately, Europe has extended her dominion over the other three parts – Africa, Asia, and America. Europe has grown to think that she is entitled to her role as Mistress of the World with all the rest of mankind created for her benefit. Supposedly erudite philosophers have tried to claim that the inhabitants of Europe are innately superior, whether they be dogs or human beings. Some have even claimed that all animals degenerate in America and that even dogs cease to bark after having breathed our atmosphere for a while. It is up to us to disprove these arrogant European pretensions and to vindicate the honor of the human race. Union will enable us to do it. Disunion will prove their arrogance well-founded. Let Americans disdain to be the instruments of European greatness! Let the thirteen States, bound together in a strict and indissoluble Union, concur in erecting one great American system, superior to the control of all transatlantic force or influence, and able to dictate the terms of the connection between the old and the new world!

"Advertisement Supported by By Abby Goodnough DERRY, N.H.  A fight to lead the New Hampshire Republican Party through next year’s presidential race ended Saturday with an upset victory by a conservative candidate backed by members of the Tea Party and other grass-roots groups. The candidate, Jack Kimball, a relative newcomer to party politics who ran for governor last year as a fiscal and social conservative, beat Juliana Bergeron, who leads the Cheshire County Republicans and was supported by former Gov. John H. Sununu, the outgoing party chairman. The race was watched as a sign of how much influence Tea Party groups will exert here in the lead-up to New Hampshire’s presidential primary, the first in the nation, tentatively scheduled for Feb. 14, 2012. Mr. Kimball wasted no time in saying, minutes after his election, that he wanted the state’s Republican primary voters to choose a “good, strong conservative” candidate. At least one potential presidential candidate hustled to congratulate Mr. Kimball. Before speaking with reporters, he took a cellphone call from former Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota, who is scheduled to be here on Monday for a book-signing. Andrew Hemingway, chairman of the Republican Liberty Caucus of New Hampshire, said Mr. Kimball’s win was evidence that the Tea Party and similar groups were pushing the state’s Republican Party to the right. Mr. Hemingway’s group helped a large number of conservatives, including many with Tea Party support, win election to the state legislature in the fall. “I don’t think it’s fair to say that New Hampshire is a moderate state, and I think this proves it,” Mr. Hemingway said. “There are new people voting, and they have a conservative outlook.” Others said that the vote was not a sure sign of a changing Republican electorate. Republican primary voters here chose John McCain in 2008, and Barack Obama won the state decisively in the general election, with help from its many independents. In a presidential straw poll conducted at the party meeting by ABC News and WMUR-TV, Mr. Pawlenty received 8 percent of the vote. In backing Ms. Bergeron for Republican leader, Mr. Sununu seemed to be sending the message that Mr. Kimball, a self-described “warrior” who has said he would not tolerate deviation from the party platform, would threaten party unity at a crucial time. In a strongly worded speech to state committee members before the vote, Mr. Sununu said that he was worried about divisions within the party and warned that its leaders must not alienate more moderate members, independents  who make up about 40 percent of the state’s voters  or even Democrats. “We don’t want to be seen as a party that’s a sliver of a party,” he said. “We want to be seen as a party that welcomes all views.” Mr. Sununu also urged the roughly 425 members in attendance not to alienate any Republican presidential candidates leading into the 2012 primary, saying it was imperative for New Hampshire to provide a “comfortable environment” for all. “We have a responsibility because every four years the world watches as we are the most significant component in selecting a president of the United States,” he said. “The worst thing for the New Hampshire first-in-the-nation primary is for people to feel this is not a place they want to participate.” This month, Mr. Kimball alarmed some Republicans here when he said the new chairman should let presidential candidates know that New Hampshire Republicans want their party to “get back to its conservative values and stay there.” Traditionally, the state party chairman remains diligently neutral in presidential primaries, serving more as a good-will ambassador. Mr. Kimball won the support of several powerful Republicans, including the new speaker of the state’s House of Representatives, William O’Brien, and its majority leader, D. J. Bettencourt. After his victory, which came in a 222-to-199 vote, Mr. Kimball told reporters that he would not take sides in the primary. “It’s the folks that are going to make those determinations,” Mr. Kimball said. “It is the state G.O.P. chair’s responsibility to remain neutral and to make sure that there is an even playing field for all candidates.” Addressing committee members, Mr. Kimball promised to build on Mr. Sununu’s successes and keep the party unified. “I feel I can be that bridge for the new activists and the old,” he said. “I am a Republican  a conservative Republican who happens to have come out of the Tea Parties, but you will find the Reagan values in this guy.” He also vowed to fight to ensure New Hampshire’s primary remained the first in the nation, a point of pride that was challenged in 2008 and almost surely will be again next year. In the straw poll, former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, who has not curried Tea Party support, won with 36 percent of the vote, followed by Representative Ron Paul of Texas with 11 percent. Mr. Pawlenty was next with his 8 percent, and Sarah Palin received 7 percent. More than a dozen other potential candidates won smaller percentages. Advertisement"
"Cost of crime and punishment is high on new governor Nathan Deal's list By Jim Galloway The Atlanta Journal-Constitution ATLANTA — Despite three years of turmoil, the economic crisis in Georgia has resulted in few fundamental shifts in state policy. We have had furloughs, layoffs and ballooning classrooms forced by the whittling of state and local budgets. Price-conscious state troopers, looking to save on gas, are chasing fewer speeders and setting up more DUI gantlets. But the Great Recession has yet to alter our basic approach to problems — although that may be about to change. In recent days, both Gov. Nathan Deal and House Speaker David Ralston have dropped not-so-subtle hints that Georgia can no longer afford to lock up so many of its people. Or, at least, so many of the wrong people. Some of the first words out of Deal's mouth as governor last week touched on the cost of crime and punishment. ""One out of every 13 Georgia residents is under some form of correctional control,"" he said in his inaugural address. ""It costs about $3 million per day to operate our Department of Corrections."" The governor spoke carefully. Law enforcement ranks are still fuming over the December death of Trooper Chadwick LeCroy, allegedly killed by a miscreant who had skated through the judicial system 18 times. Violent men and women will be kept behind bars, the new governor promised. But we need to rethink the costs of locking up others. Nonviolent drug offenders, for instance. ""As a state, we cannot afford to have so many of our citizens waste their lives because of addictions,"" Deal said. ""It is draining our state treasury and depleting our work force."" Georgia has roughly 53,000 people under lock and key — a higher proportion of its population than that of all but seven other states. Those whose principal offense is possession of cocaine, crack or methamphetamine number 1,500 by themselves. Look for the governor to propose a statewide expansion of drug courts that emphasize treatment rather than prison. As for the source of Deal's inspiration, cast your eyes no further than the man who administered his oath of office: Hall County Superior Court Judge Jason Deal, the governor's 42-year-old son, who runs one of Georgia's 28 drug courts. ""I would come home and tell stories about what I'd seen,"" Jason Deal said in an interview. ""If you don't believe in miracles, just come see drug court for a day. You'll leave believing in miracles. When [drug offenders] start getting clean and being held accountable and having to work, their whole life changes. They become law-abiding citizens who work every day and support their kids. That should be the goal of our justice system."" The phrase ""drug court"" is something of a misnomer — because to enter, you first have to plead guilty. Participants are required to have a job and pay the costs of the program. Random testing for drug use is constant. Upon completion of a two-year program of addiction treatment and counseling, the felony conviction is erased. Violations and backsliding are punished with community service and jail time. The key, Jason Deal said, is presenting participants with immediate consequences for their actions. Think, he said, of the normal bureaucratic path a criminal takes. ""Somebody commits a crime, they get arrested and they go bond out. It may be a year before they have to face the consequences of their act. That's terrible when you think about behavior modification,"" Jason Deal said. His drug court is different. ""If you test positive on Tuesday, you're going to come see me on Friday, and I'm going to put you in jail. Not for a long time — but long enough to get your attention,"" Jason Deal said. Nathan and Sandra Deal are big fans of their son's work. In an interview last week, the first lady proudly noted that Jason Deal had been forced to buy more refrigerators to house a surplus of urine samples. Nathan Deal, as a congressman in 2009, addressed a graduating class of his son's drug court. But Gov. Deal won't be relying solely on Judge Deal's experience to justify an end to placing drug addicts behind bars. A report issued by the state Department of Audits last year said that only 7 percent of those who went through drug courts in 2005 returned to the criminal life. Among a similar population that was sent to prison, the recidivism rate was 29 percent. ""Each individual sentenced to drug court instead of state prison saves the state an estimated $10,293 in sentencing costs,"" the report said. In other words, drug courts cost less and work better than prisons. ""We're spending a huge amount of money locking people up that have drug problems,"" Ralston said earlier this month. ""At some point, the people of Georgia have a right to ask if that's an appropriate way to spend their tax dollars."" On the Senate side, both Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle and Senate President pro tem Tommie Williams, R-Lyons, say they're open to the idea of putting drug offenders somewhere other than prison — if the thing is done right. Drug courts aren't magic. They cost money to establish. One of the larger hurdles would be making sure participants had access to jobs while they're being treated. But conservatives often say that economic hardship is a fine thing when it comes to government because it forces efficiencies upon those most resistant to change. We're about to find out how true that is. "

"An emboldened caucus of Senate Republicans came out in full force in favor of a bill to repeal the new health care law Monday, just hours after Federal Judge Roger Vinson ruled the law unconstitutional. All 47 Republicans have signed on as co-sponsors to a repeal measure in the Senate, said South Carolina Sen. Jim DeMint, chairman of the Senate Steering Committee. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who controls what bills are allowed to reach the Senate floor, has vowed repeatedly that he will not allow a vote on any repeal bill. But there are procedural maneuvers Senate Republicans can take to get it on the floor, including offering it as an amendment to another bill. Republicans began the process last week to use Senate Rule 14, a procedural objection tactic, to put the House bill passed on Jan. 19 to a vote in the upper chamber. Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and John Barrasso of Wyoming plan to introduce legislation that provides Americans the opportunity to “opt-out” of the portion of the law mandating that all citizens purchase health insurance plans. The U.S. Department of Justice plans to challenge the judge’s ruling, and legal observers expect the question of the law’s constitutionality to eventually reach the U.S. Supreme Court.

"On Monday, U.S. District Court Judge Roger Vinson in Florida ruled the ObamaCare health insurance mandate unconstitutional. And although this law will still have to be heard by other courts, what if eventually the Supreme Court of the United States finds the law constitutional, as many Democrats would prefer? According to author Ann Coulter, they perhaps should be careful of what they ask for. On Monday’s broadcast of Fox News Channel’s “Hannity,” host Sean Hannity asked Coulter to offer her thoughts on what he deemed a thoughtful ruling by Vinson, citing James Madison and the Federalist Papers. “He also quoted Obama saying we don’t need an individual mandate,” Coulter said. “OK, then try to pass your health care law without it. Though, you know the Democrats and the White House are also arguing that the linchpin of the law is the individual mandate, which is why the judge found the entire law unconstitutional. It doesn’t work without forcing people to buy insurance. I must say, I mean there are two court opinions on each side now.” Watch: She added that supposing the law was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, then Congress could impose its will on anyone using this authority and therefore Republicans should use it to champion their issues – gun ownership and religion. “Obviously, I find the two that hold it unconstitutional more compelling, but I mean for logical reasons, Which is to say the interstate commerce clause – there’s no point in having even any limits on Congress’ authority if they can force citizens, all citizens to buy a product,” she continued. “By the way, if this is constitutional, then Republicans should turn around and mandate all citizens be forced to purchase a gun and a Bible. And, there’s a lot more evidence that owning a gun and a Bible is better for society than everyone having to own health insurance. But, if that’s what Congress has the right to do, we can have all kinds of mandates. The interstate commerce clause says Congress can regulate either something that affects interstate commerce or the instrumentalities of interstate commerce. I think the judge, Judge Vinson makes a good case as apparently the plaintiffs did that simply not buying insurance is not an activity.” The Daily Caller | 1775 Eye Street NW | Suite 1150-290 | Washington, DC 20006"
"by Brett Stevens on February 7, 2011 As usual in politics, we’re going about everything the wrong way. Huge parts of the Midwest and South want to distance themselves from Obama, so talk about nullification and secession looms. That backward thought suggests that, if a new idea takes over your land and turns out to be horribly wrong, you should drop out and let it take over the rest. I propose instead a scientific approach. When you have a new idea to test, you create a control group which you keep as it has been, and separate a new smaller group on which you test the new idea. This way, you can see how that idea works out. Liberalism proclaims itself a new way. It’s “progress,” a new vision, a social vision instead of an economic or hierarchical one. It is begging to be tested. I propose we make California our test subject, a nation-within-a-nation, and construct a Liberal Utopia there. Instead of constantly fighting over whether liberal or conservative ideas are right, we can implement the liberal ideas — all of them — in a test subject that is both wealthy and varied. Legalize dope, keep abortion legal, go hogwild with diversity, enact all the welfare you can, ban all taboos, make gay marriage mandatory if you want. Just do it in California. The rest of us will watch. It takes about three decades to see the beginnings of the long-term effects of any political plan, as Europe has found out. By 2040, we can know whether liberalism will work for us here in the United States. No one has any legitimate reason to prove this plan. Liberals, who presumably believe their leftist and progressive ideas can work, should welcome this chance to create a Utopia and show the world how right they are. Conservatives, who believe their ideas are workable, should delight in this chance to be seen in contrast to whatever comes from the liberal Utopia. Instead of splitting our nation in half over our irreconcilable divide between liberalism and conservative values, maybe we should just make a test subject — a blank canvas for liberal imaginations — and see how our idealistic notions work out there.

"by James D. Best Contrary to popular opinion, the Boston Tea party was more than a protest over taxes. Taxes were a big element, but it was also a protest against a Parliament that wouldn’t listen, denied the colonists representation, and tried to control trade throughout the empire. It took many years of corrosive exchanges between the American colonies and England to ignite the Boston Tea Party. The Boston Tea Party was not a prank perpetuated by a few rowdies dressed as Native Americans. On December 16, 1773, as many as 7,000 people congregated around the Old South Meeting House. Hundreds crowded into the church to hear partisan speeches, but most of the protesters spilled out onto the streets. Legend has it Sam Adams gave a signal to send 200 colonists—a few dressed as Native Americans—marching in columns down to the docks. As they approached, the protestors split into equally sized groups to board the three tea-carrying ships. Within three hours, the Tea Partiers broke open 342 chests and threw the tea into the sea. The Sons of Liberty organized the protest. For the most part, the Sons of Liberty was comprised of merchants, tradesmen, farmers, and the professionally self-employed. Americans were used to limited government, and with the truly free markets in the New World, many, if not most, had built a prosperous life. They had engaged in trade within the colonies, but Parliament had severely restricted their trade with the rest of the world. They despised control of their livelihood, which included the tea monopoly given to the East India Company by Parliament. The Boston Tea Party was a deliberate act by ordinary citizens who would be remembered for their extraordinary courage and conviction. Beyond the tax, it was a revolt against the philosophy of mercantilism that lay behind the Townshend Revenue Act of 1767. Mercantilism assumed the world economy was a zero-sum game, but Adam Smith, in Wealth of Nations proposed a new economic theory that said the capitalism and free markets grew wealth for all. The colonists had a perfect example right before them. Starting from scratch, commerce and prosperity thrived to the point where most Americans were literate, well-fed, and optimistic about their future. In fact, Philadelphia had grown to be the second largest English speaking city in the world. Back in England, Parliament reacted predictably. First, members ridiculed and belittled the protesters. Then they punished the colonies by passing the Intolerable Acts which, among other things, closed Boston Harbor. For all the rage against the colonists, no one in London seemed to notice the mounting emotion, growing size, or broad-based leadership of the movement. The modern Tea Party movement has many similarities with its namesake. More than two centuries later, on April 15, 2009, reborn Tea Parties assembled throughout the United States, to protest a government which was unresponsive. Like the original Boston Tea Party, today’s incarnation exploded from grassroots discontent; leadership is dispersed; and affiliated organizations spread out across the nation so fast it startled seasoned politicos. The Tea Party deserves a lot of credit for raising awareness about excessive government spending, the national debt, and the encroachment of the national government on more and more aspects of the economy and daily lives of Americans. The discontent that set off the Boston Tea Party eventually led to rebellion. Tea Partiers engage in peaceful demonstrations because, unlike 1773, they have representation. Not only were the colonists unrepresented in Parliament, the king appointed the top executive in most of the colonies. Today, the Tea Party wields a potent ballot box to make their voice heard. Congress may not have fully grasped the message from voters and activists, but as the movement refuses to abate, they are listening better every day. When people get dissatisfied enough to leave their home, those in power need to heed their concerns. James D. Best is the author of Tempest at Dawn, a novel about the 1787 Constitutional Convention.

Sam Adams was pretty busy for a lot of years riling everyone up before the actual event. [Reply] Leave a Comment Name E-mail Website Notify me of follow-up comments via e-mail "
" At least you admit you have no morals nor is charity important to, that however still does not mean are not an arsehole. There are vast numbers of impoverished people in Africa, India, China etc. So you will have no problem if redistributing your wealth to make sure those regions are no threat to the stability of the society and thus be able to buy the shit others are selling. And of course having bankrupt states and chasing away business makes perfect economic sense. Oh there is a perfectly sound moral argument too, but you guys believe taxes are worse than starvation so there is little common ground there. Ya it makes economic sense for the increasingly globalized world to increase in prosperity too, but one thing at a time. Tony|2.18.11 @ 7:55PM|# “Oh there is a perfectly sound moral argument too, but you guys believe taxes are worse than starvation…” You’re a lying sack of shit. Tony|2.18.11 @ 5:35PM|# “Fuck charity and fuck morality. It’s about what makes the most economic sense. Having vast numbers of impoverished people is a direct threat to you…” You’re a lying sack of shit. By this argument, shooting the poor people is the way to go. I mean, fuck charity and morality, right? We shoot anyone whose income drops below the poverty line and the rest of us get to divvy up their stuff. It makes more economic sense! Swoosh! Tony|2.18.11 @ 7:57PM|# “Swoosh!” And I’ll bet your Mommy told you that meant something other than you are an ignoramus. Of course you can’t debate the point. I was not claiming that morality should be absent from policy discussions, I was ignoring it for the moment because you guys have no moral coherence. I’m right morally, but, more relevantly, I’m right economically. You guys are wrong on every count. Your argumentation is at a 4th grade “I’m right, you’re wrong!” level, yet you’re clearly not in the 4th grade. Seriously, what is the financial component in this for you? You talk about beach houses and laptops, but when some commenter here destroys your arguments, or even challenges them, you disappear like the morning fog. The only people I’ve met in my life who practice this sort of constant straw man, distraction style method of argumentation are lawyers and PR managers (I’m sure there are others). Both of them represent professions that are paid to continuously spout talking points and avoid an actual search for the truth. Even MNG has the ability to address pertinent arguments made against his assertions. You don’t, and don’t seem to want to. Yet you’re here, getting pounded into the ground at each appearance, and fleeing out the window when the paint approaches your corner. You can spell. You can form a sentence and organize a thought, yet there’s something unnervingly phony about your entire presence. Worst of all (for you), you’re only helping to destroy your own arguments by this behavior. Funny how you selectively use “morality” in your welfare arguments, Tony… Fuck charity and fuck morality. No Tony, fuck you. Charity that is not freely given is not charity, no matter what your idiot college professors told you. Charity and morality make economic sense, where coercion and collusion do not. One is more common in freer markets, the other is more common in government restricted markets. Having vast numbers of impoverished people is a direct threat to you and the stability of the society in which you are able to prosper. Define poverty. For those without knowledge of basic economics, poverty is not defined in terms of absolutes. It has nothing to do with absolute measures of subsistence, or health, or quality of clothing or standards of living. It is simply based on income percentiles; if you rank financially in the bottom third of the population, then you are below the poverty line (the exact placement of the poverty line may vary from country to country). To put this concept in stark relief, consider this: if everybody in North America experiences a tenfold increase in wealth over the next 30 days, the number of people living below the poverty line won’t change one iota. The “poor” grocery store clerks might have 6000 square foot homes and Porsches, but the “rich” people would have 30,000 square foot homes and McLarens (insert whatever ostentatious displays of wealth you prefer, if you’re not into cars). In other words, a general increase in the standard of living cannot possibly eliminate poverty, no matter how high that increase is. It’s all relative, so even the most comfortable country in the world must have poverty … unless the government forces everyone’s standard of living to be the same. Being charitable with OTHER peoples money is not charity no matter how much you try to convince yourself how good a person that makes you. I wish we could shout this from the rooftops and tattoo it on the foreheads of every leftoid schmuck in the country. It’s easy to be generous and charitable with other people’s money. Is it moral? Not by a long shot. Is it moral to knowingly put millions of people into misery over a stupid philosophy? Nope. Tony|2.18.11 @ 9:17PM|# “Is it moral to knowingly put millions of people into misery over a stupid philosophy? Nope. Shut up and sit down, assshole. Ask Stalin and Mao, your philosophical cohorts. You are the master of absurd assumption. You have a career in modeling progressive and Keynesian public policy. Translation from Tony-ese to English, Re: Tony, Change tax policy so that it’s more progressive. Steal more. Bolster the safety net. Include more thieves. Make rules for the financial sector so that reckless gambling with the nation’s money is discouraged, and actual productivity is encouraged Encourage rent-seeking. (after all, the only  the financial sector exists is to support the economy I believe the economy is a thing, not a phenomenon. The more people with disposable income, the more money goes into the economy I’m a Keynesian. I see things backwards. Rich people simply don’t spend as much of their money as the middle class does. That’s just an obvious reality. I am a nitwit who thinks spending is productive. Oh, by the way Tony: People spend because they produced previously. it doesn’t work the other way around. Try learning some economics, at least for a refreshing change. Anyway, I’m done with this post. Obama is a scary narcissist, a would be dictator with a fake smile and a heavy hand. People in this country are so dumb they think he’s a “great guy.” I can’t help the stupid, but hopefully enough people will see the light by 2012. As for Tony and other economic idiots on this board, probably a waste of breath. 2% of wage earners pay 40% of the federal income tax. Can’t get much more progressive than that. What Tony wants is for someone to babysit him, for the little boy that he is…. Obama is a moderately liberal pragmatic Democrat who was actually elected to office legitimately unlike his predecessor. Fox News rots the brain. Where’s the difference? They both suck. Obama is a moderately liberal pragmatic Democrat A leftist moderate would not organize the DNC and his former community group to shut down a state capital and shut down schools over a government union squabble with the state’s Governor and majority legislature who are trying to balance their budget. The most a moderate would do is say a few words about it to the press. Radical action requires a more radical response. The Republicans want to destroy unions and they know if it gets done in Wisconsin, it can get done anywhere else. Obama has a duty as a Democrat to do everything he can to stop them. Tony|2.18.11 @ 9:16PM|# “Radical action requires a more radical response.” Shut up and sit down, asshole. Obama has a duty as a Democrat to do everything he can to stop them. Wow. Thanks for arguing that Obama’s duty to his party trumps his duty as President. You’ve summed up in one sentence exactly why people such as yourself should be locked up in cages and thrown into the ocean. You have nothing more to offer in your philosophy but glorified managerial feudalism. And here you are doing free prostitution for Republicans. Such self-motivated entrepreneurs you are!

I hope you’re prepared to accept that. “Obama has a duty as a Democrat to do everything he can to stop them.” Sooo… He has no duty whatsoever as President of the United States to any of the citizens of Wisconsin (or any other State for that matter) who are NOT Democrats?

I had long suspected as much but it is going to be delicious watching your type and Obama spell this out so explicitly in the months to come to the mushy middle!

As an Independent Contractor! “Deety we really need someone like you up in Gotham to take care of XYZ”. “You KNOW that I charge a base of $100 just to drive up there from here in Springfield! You MUST have someone in Gotham for something like this, should cost you $60 total! That’s what I would charge if it were in-town for me.” “No, it’s an important client. We need them done right and we need them done on deadline. No room for error!” “Why would you tilt your hand this way if you weren’t desperate? Do yourself a favor call around for a few days and source this out!” “Don’t you want to know what the exact scope of work is, the deadline?” “No! Hang up now and call someone cheaper! I’m mentioning to you NOW that I am committed to my “real job” down here thru Friday and have a family event all Saturday…” * 4 hours later* “I tried, Deety but we still want YOU.” “I don’t WANT to, not this week, not driving up to Gotham, I hate that shit! Nothing personal.” “What if we offered you $600?” “For six hours worth of my time including commute on a Saturday? For 3 BS 30 min. projects like this? You must be crazy, let me talk to Abigail (the big boss)! *Abigail cuts in* “It’s an important client. I authorized this. It’s not just important that you can complete the job. [Any monkey could!] You work very well getting those jobs completed in retail locations with enthusiastic feedback. It reflects well on us and it reflects well on our clients.” “Well, shit.” (Flattery and a bit of cash will get you EVERYWHERE with me it seems.) “It’s not like my cousin’s daughter isn’t likely to have many more birthdays in her life and even if SHE won’t I have like 15 other Aunts and Uncles and upwards of 40 something cousins to supply any lack of rug-rats in my life!” “I’m in!” Aaaawww!!! See Tony, how exploited the little guy can be by the evil “free market” Plutocrats? Too bad I don’t have a union to NEGOTIATE a “fair” wage for me, no? I discerned what a ‘fair’ wage for those projects on a piece-work basis was, in town, for me. I even TOLD the recruiter that it was probably wasteful to try to import my labor to a far away city. I don’t know exactly WHY they hired me at that outrageous sum for such a simple shit job but they did and they keep hiring me for other jobs as well. (Some of them ARE kind of crappy $20 per location jobs that require I hang out in gang-banger territory [in Town] after dark.) Radical action requires a more radical response. I don’t disagree but it does make Obama a radical not a moderate as you claimed above. Tony|2.18.11 @ 5:46PM|# “Obama is a moderately liberal pragmatic Democrat who was actually elected to office legitimately unlike his predecessor.” Lies. “Fox News rots the brain.” I take it you’re an example. If we do not address this enormous problem of ever growing, politically motivated entitlements now, we will not be able to address it in the future. By his many, many unconscionable actions since he was elected, Obama has shown that he does not have the best interests of the United States at heart. In fact the vast majority of his actions have been decidedly un-presidential. To accurately reflect this I will hence forth always refer to him as the UN-President.

Yeah, I’m against Obama on this one. Its pure politics, and bad policy. The Republicans deserve it, the American people don’t. Your a rasist! This was Tony’s thread. This is Tony’s theme Fuck.  Just in case I wasn’t clear, Republicans want to destroy unions (and public employees have the last big one), because unions give money to Democrats. This is not about workers having too many rights, it’s about Republicans trying to make policy that makes it easier for them to win elections. That is what you guys are supporting. Are you proud of yourselves? “Just in case I wasn’t clear, Republicans want to destroy unions (and public employees have the last big one)” Did the UAW and AFL-CIO implode when I wasn’t looking? “because unions give money to Democrats.” And if unions were purely voluntary organizations, then there wouldn’t be anything wrong with that. But sadly, right-to-work laws have not been passed on a national level, and thus most unions are still labor cartels. “This is not about workers having too many rights, it’s about Republicans trying to make policy that makes it easier for them to win elections.” So it’s good political strategy to stoke the rage of unions, some of the most influential organizations come election time? “That is what you guys are supporting. Are you proud of yourselves?” Yes, we do support requiring gluttonous public-employees to pay for more of their own retirement. Yes, we are against union monopolies. Yes, we don’t believe collective bargaining is a “right”, if such things exist in the first place. I for one am very proud of myself, thanks. Making statists cry is one of the greatest pleasures for a libertarian, right up there with kicking old people in the teeth and running over the poor in gas-guzzling Cadillac Escalades. “kicking old people in the teeth and running over the poor in gas-guzzling Cadillac Escalades.” Hey, careful there! Not only is Tony an ignoramus, his/her sarcasm detector is out of order. S/he’ll take that seriously! You ignorant tool, before you focus on teachers and firefighters, why don’t you give a second’s thought to the people who’ve been actually stealing from society, the ones benefiting the most from government policy? You aren’t wrong because of your principles, you’re wrong because you apply your principles selectively, as in, however Limbaugh or whatever plutocrat mouthpiece tells you to. God damn you people are hopeless. Limbaugh? LOL. You ignorant tool, before you focus on teachers and firefighters, why don’t you give a second’s thought to the people who’ve been actually stealing from society, the ones benefiting the most from government policy? That would be people who would rather do drugs than work. They should be left to starve to death on the streets. That would be people who would rather do drugs than work. I disagree. That would be the crony insiders of GS, GM and Lawrence Summers, etc. who, after their organizations miraculously survived the “shake-up”, were appointed to top positions in the Obama administration. Tony doesn’t like to talk about how corrupt his Chicago hero is. The difference in relevence lies in the differentiation between the Federal and State budget deficits. State deficits are cracking precisely because of PubSec unions and their control on the individual legislatures, along with other unfunded entitlement programs. California’s unfunded pensions are estimated at 500B – 1Trillion. Unsustainable. The end is coming, and these people have run up their compensation over the last decade + so that, when the time for ‘cuts’ actually happens, their negotiated “reductions” will leave them still far ahead of the rest of society. It’s a ponzi scheme and wealth transfer, and has nothing to to with ‘rights’. Would that be GM, or one of the many banks that Bush/Obama gave taxpayer money to? That would be tax-payer money. It is a slight conflict of interest don’t you think? Actually, not true. The largest donors to the Democratic Party the last two election cycles were Wall Street/banking interests and lawyers. Unions were a distant third place. Brian Miller|2.19.11 @ 12:49PM|# “Actually, not true.

I want to “destroy” (not really destroy just level the playing field) Unions for completely different  then what you claim are the  why the Republicans are doing it. No this isn’t how a normal President should act, but then Obama isn’t a normal President. Obama is and extreme left wing ideologue that is heavily invested in the corrupt deal the democrats have made with the public employee unions. The unions provide billions of dollars and votes to get democrats elected and democrats tax working people to pass provide every increasing payoffs…I mean salaries and benefits to the unions. If that corrupt deal breaks down the democrats and Obama might not get the money and votes they need to keep their extreme left wing ideology alive. So Obama is mobilizing to protect his corrupt compact. Its a result of his extreme left wing ideology, and more than that…its the Chicago Way. Meaning corrupt! Tony|2.18.11 @ 9:14PM|# “Just in case I wasn’t clear, Republicans want to destroy unions (and public employees have the last big one), because unions give money to Democrats.” Oh, you are *very* clear.

You are a lying asshole with all the redeeming qualities of a train-wreck. Go away, asshole. How can libertarians oppose citizens bargaining for a contract timb|2.18.11 @ 10:02PM|# “How can libertarians oppose citizens bargaining for a contract” Uh, who said libertarians are? The people in question are “bargaining”; they’re trying to use the coercion of the government to rent-seek. But I have a feeling being busted on your lie isn’t what you had in mind. Correction: “aren’t “bargaining”” Jeesh why are you guys even conversing with Tony? Democrats, Republicans, whatever. If he cannot grasp the simple fact that it is just plain old immoral to force one group of people, against their will, to subsidize the lifestyle and retirement of another group people then the guy is a total twit. This whole thing is absurdly simple. What you have with this situation is a small percentage of the population pitching a fit because the rest of us are coming to the conclusion that the services they are providing are no where near the compensation they are demanding. Well, fuck them. Fire them all and get a group of people in there that can do the job. No, nowhere is it written stone that coercing people is bad. No. I know it sounds terrible, but its the foundation of civilization. Just so you know? When you hear in our founding documents somebody talking about “liberty”? They’re talking about the opposite of “coercing people”. When you hear them talking about “justice”? They’re talking about the government protecting people from coercion. Seriously, your ideas about how “coercing people” isn’t a big deal? They’re bogus. Our founding documents are all about liberty and justice–which means not coercing people–and everybody who still cares about liberty and justice and isn’t drawing a paycheck from the government? Is disgusted by the public employee unions. Everybody. They’re a parasite on the American people, and if you work for the government and you’ve come to imagine yourself entitled to the fruit of their labor, then you’re a disgrace to the American people too. I mean, holy smokes… These union members are interfering with the right of the people of Wisconsin to govern themselves! It’s indefensible. I didn’t say it wasn’t a big deal. A Constitution or social compact that binds government to protect liberty implies coercing politicians and those with public power NOT to pass certain laws. I’m saying that if you base your entire argument on the simple moral point that coercing = wrong, then your argument is on its face weak. There’s nothing weak about it. Coercion is crime. If you’re saying we can’t put a stop to crime without coercion, then you’re in some kind of circular argument. Stopping people from coercing others isn’t coercion. The only person here having trouble keeping up is you. And the kind of coercion we’re talking about here can’t even be conflated with coercive things like tax collection! I may think income taxes and property taxes are coercive, much more so than sales taxes, which are more or less figured into the price of things and paid voluntarily–but the kind of coercion you’re openly defending isn’t even comparable to that! At least with our coercive taxation, we can vote the politicians who support that taxation out of office if we want to. How do I vote the public employee unions out of office?! “No taxation without representation.”–do you understand what that means?! The people of Wisconsin voted for their state politicians–and the government employee unions are inflicting themselves on the people of Wisconsin…over and above any authority by their legitimate government. The government employees aren’t even accountable to their own politicians?! That’s a subversion of the basic premise of government by the consent of the governed! That’s the coercion you’re defending?! You’re saying that the people of Wisconsin have no right to complain about the coercion they’re being subjected to by their own government workers–because… …because coercion has become so ubiquitous that it’s unacceptable to object to it?! That’s worse than absurd. That’s sick. “The people of Wisconsin voted for their state politicians–and the government employee unions are inflicting themselves on the people of Wisconsin…over and above any authority by their legitimate government. The government employees aren’t even accountable to their own politicians?!” I mean, in your world, how do the people of Wisconsin get the government employees unions under control? Is there any option other than moving out of state? The most basic functions of government are coercive. Before you can even talk about preventing theft you have to acknowledge that government coerces people from stealing. Living among other people requires coercion. Grow up and deal with it. Because no one has the right to steal, the government employee unions have a right to override the legitimately elected politicians the people of Wisconsin chose to run their government?! Because no one has a right to steal, the people of Wisconsin should suffer whatever the public employee unions decide to inflict on them–regardless of what their legitimately elected representatives legislate?! Even if protecting people from coercion like theft were the same thing as coercion, what you’re suggesting doesn’t even pass the smell test. If the only  you aren’t stealing is brcause it’s against the law, that makes you a pretty fucked up individual. Well, first of all, I’m not arguing in favor of the public employee unions, as I made clear earlier in this thread. So do yourself a favor and stop creating that straw man. Second, “stopping people from coercing others isn’t coercion”? Really? Thats exactly what that is. The point isn’t that coercion is wrong, it’s that certain types of coercion are wrong due to some underlying theory or value. I’m arguing that the underlying theory of coercion = bad is simplistic and easily rebutted. Justice isn’t coercion. In fact, the whole idea of justice is about when the government can use force without it being coercive. Generally speaking, the government is supposed to prove beyond a able doubt that someone used coercion on another party–and intended to do so–before they can use force and deprive someone of their liberty or property. That’s what justice is all about. The use of force isn’t necessarily coercion either. If someone uses the courts to enforce a contract–an agreement both parties entered into quite willingly–that’s hardly coercive. Justice is the opposite of coercion. That’s why they call it “justice”. Coercion is crime when ordinary people do it, and when governments do it, it’s called “injustice”. “Second, “stopping people from coercing others isn’t coercion”? Really? Thats exactly what that is. The point isn’t that coercion is wrong, it’s that certain types of coercion are wrong due to some underlying theory or value. I’m arguing that the underlying theory of coercion = bad is simplistic and easily rebutted.” Only for those willfully ignorant. There are two ways to get someone to do something: 1) Persuasion. 2) Coercion. Coercion may be necessary in the case of self-defense, but it is always bad. “Coercion may be necessary in the case of self-defense, but it is always bad.” See? I’d argue that self-defense is a legitimate justification for shooting someone because “self-defense” means you didn’t have any choice… You were coerced! Coercion is always the difference between criminal behavior and freedom. The difference between sex and rape is coercion. The difference between a contract and fraud is coercion. The difference between accepting a charitable donation and armed robbery is coercion. The difference between murder and justifiable self defense is coercion! The determining factor is always coercion. Coercion is the definition of crime. …without exception. And justice is the opposite of crime. I think most of our political problems come from people like GMAC, who, for some , can’t seem to tell the difference between justice and crime. In this instance, it’s particularly egregious too! It’s one thing when you’re defending some supposed right of the majority to elect leaders to “coerce” the rest of us to do things. …much worse to suggest that the people of Wisconsin have no right to complain about government employee unions inflicting themselves on their democratic process–because coercion is ubiquitous?! It was an absurd suggestion to begin with. “See? I’d argue that self-defense is a legitimate justification for shooting someone because “self-defense” means you didn’t have any choice…” It is or would be justified. And it still would be ‘bad’; I’d rather not have to do that. I’d rather people not resort to force or have to resort to force. ; ) “I know it sounds terrible, but its the foundation of civilization.” Ken, you probably beat me to it. G Mc, you’re full of it. Coercion isn’t the ‘foundation of civilization’, it’s the sad admission that there are those who must be kept from harming others. Further, without constraint, it’s the end of civilization. Given that, we grant government the monopoly on coercion and do our best to limit its use. The ‘foundation of civilization’ is the voluntary truck between those who wish no harm to others. So . . . we grant government a monopoly on coercion just for the fun of it? Not because its the foundational notion of Western civilization? You rebut what I say, then fail to establish why. Why is it a “sad admission”? Is it always sad to acknowledge facts of human behavior?

Repeal of the 13th Amendment, here we come! You are coerced from enslaving another person. You’re confused. An inability to control the behavior of another person who is not threatening you does not constitute ‘coercion’. Without the approval of the government, ‘enslaving’ others becomes quite tricky. But you’re welcome to try it yourself if you think you’ll be successful. G Mc|2.20.11 @ 12:33PM|# “You are coerced from enslaving another person.” Bullshit. The claim is that the government “stopped” slavery. It didn’t; it simply stopped enforcing it. It stopped as soon as the government stopped enforcing slavery through coercion. No, coercion is not the basis for civilization. For clarity: “It [slavery] stopped as soon as the government stopped enforcing slavery through coercion. No, coercion is not the basis for civilization.” Holy shit that is stupid. Force? Those poor corporations entered into these contracts against their will? Is this a joke? You pea brains have been brainwashed with this Ayn Randian fantasy. You’re all probably not much different than the working class yet you have been hoodwinked into attacking those like you and you run inter democratic legitimacy. Absolutely. 85% of Americans opposed TARP, yet it was passed overwhelmingly. 55% of Americans opposed the Iraq War, but it was pushed into place without regard to their opinion. And 60% of Wisconsinites are in favor of the governor’s bill to rationalize state employee compensation, but the unions aren’t interested in allowing the lumpenproles to slow down the gravy train. Actually, support was high in the beginning. 3-16-2003 Poll 1. Would you favor invading Iraq with U.S. ground troops in the next week or two to remove Saddam Hussein from power? * Favor: 58% * Oppose: 40% 2.

The Governor should stop imperiling our children’s education…. He should hire teachers who are going to show up to school. Tony is the Jacket posting to boost site hits! I read it on DailyKOS!

Are inferior hivemind, destined to suck on the dregs of society and be tossed bones like so many oysters. Sensemaking is not my fucking business. Hey! Remember when people were all snarking about how the Republicans, once given power, would quickly prove themselves to be just as big a bunch of craven sellouts as the Dems? Meet the new boss same as the old boss and all that? Well, yeah. Looks like that’s wrong, so far. Holy shit, Scott Walker is a hero if he pulls this off. Don’t give a shit what he thinks about the drug war, or gay marriage…if he breaks the back of the public sector unions he’s done more for the state of Wisconsin than anyone in 50 years. Scott Walker cleaned up J*ck*ss Party corruption in Milwaukee County, too. God bless him and his rightful, noble cause. Stand fast, Governor! Compel their performance and obedience. If they won’t behave, fire them! Enacting a halfway-able policy does not a hero one make. Him cutting public employee benefits, while admirable, does not detract one iota from the injustice of the drug war or discriminatory policy based on sexuality Him cutting public employee benefits, while admirable, does not detract one iota from the injustice of the drug war or discriminatory policy based on sexuality You have to pick and choose your battles. With respect to marriage, this definition was used for centuries. The Supreme Court noted in ober dicta that marriage was a “union for life of one man and one woman in the holy estate of matrimony” (Murphy v. Ramsey, 114 U.S. 15 at 45) Then the state should take their fucking noses out of everyone’s business. yeah, but if he does not have the support of the people, they’ll vote him out. Then they’ll bring in another asshole who will reinstate things.. and probably make the deal a lot more cushier to make up for it, on top of back pay and a bunch of other crap. “Remember when people were all snarking about how the Republicans, once given power, would quickly prove themselves to be just as big a bunch of craven sellouts as the Dems?” I think they were thinking that in terms of the special interests that give both parties a share of the loot; unions are a staunch Democratic ally, and are therefore at a state of war with the Republicans. If SeeYou and AssFuckMe starting putting more of their campaign funds behind Republican candidates, they wouldn’t be where they are right now. You forget. President Obama hasn’t done a darn thing in his entire career except community organizing. That’s his resume. This is all he knows how to do. The time to remind public employees for whom they really work is long overdue. If they don’t like the terms and conditions, they should have the honesty and guts to resign and seek their fortunes in other occupations. They are so removed from reality that when they are expected to pay as much for their medical as the private sector producers who generate the wealth that handsomely compensates them, they whine like stuck pigs. Enough! If they don’t get back to work, fire them and hire others who will do as well or better in performance despite the modestly adjusted compensation scheme. Collecting dues for private organizations? Heck, yes! Just as valid and appropriate to collect them for my church and my membership in the NRA. Yes, let’s have more public sector administrative effort for personal and political organizations. Lawyer people: 1) Isn’t this strike a violation of the collective bargaining agreement? 2) Can’t the Organizing for America and possibly the administration be charged with interfering with a contract, a collective bargaining contract? “1) Isn’t this strike a violation of the collective bargaining agreement?” A little late but the school board has now ordered them back to work (essentially saying one more day of this will constitute a strike and a breach of the CBA). We’ll see what happens if they ignore the order, but my guess is they know better. I heard many superintendents got an injunction. Isn’t this strike a violation of the collective bargaining agreement? Not technically a strike, more of a sick-out. I wonder if a teacher who falsely claims to be sick can be fired under the agreement. Can’t the Organizing for America and possibly the administration be charged I can see a pretty solid case being made that they are engaged in tortious interference with contract. The contract requires teachers to come in, except in certain specified circumstances. Attending political protests is probably not one of those circumstances. Thus, the teachers are in breach, and their breach has been induced by their unions, Organizing for America, etc. Not technically a strike, more of a sick-out. I wonder if a teacher who falsely claims to be sick can be fired under the agreement. Dude, please. Teachers can’t be fired for having sex with students, you think taking a sick call when they really might not have an owie will result in termination? sicky! No, I’m pretty sure teachers get fired for having sex with students. At least where I’m from. Check out how NYC deals with ’em — “rubber rooms.”  So I just heard that the good Rev. Jesse Jackson will be speaking in Madison, WI soon. So how is a group of fat old white people his audience? What can he possible say to them? There’s a basic  why public sector unions should have restricted collective bargaining rights. Unlike the private sector, public sector workers can vote themselves benefits. Which they have. Public sector workers enjoy better benefits and more job security than private sector workers, a direct outcome of their ability to influence elections. In my opinion, working for the public sector should be something people do out of a sense of civic duty. It SHOULD be a sacrifice. It shouldn’t be something you go for because you can’t hold down a private sector job and want the security and cushy benefits. Leftists are always talking about how doctors shouldn’t get exhorbitant salaries. That they should work out of the goodness of their hearts, from a moral desire to help save lives. Well, why doesn’t this same logic apply to public sector workers? If money is not a primary motivating factor, why don’t public sector workers accept lower pay and benefits than private sector workers? In my opinion, working for the public sector should be something people do out of a sense of civic duty. You lost me here… The government was supposed to work on what I sometimes call “The NPR” model. Your lower level workers were supposed to get living wages and stable employment whereas your upper level government employees were supposed to make far less money as they were truly in it for the service aspect. While it can be argued that say, the President probably makes far less than he will in the private sector (doing what I can’t imagine), at the municipal and local levels, this has been far from the truth. I’ve had plenty of progressive friends continuously compare the CEO of Coke or Apple to the guy who runs 50 employees for the county Park system. The fact of the matter is that’s a bogus comparison. Many of these extremely well paid municipal mangers make way, WAY more than they ever could in the private sector– as if they were in the private sector (and those who do) more than not end up in middle to upper management jobs in obscure companies which pay “good” salaries, somewhere in the high five to low six figure range. Add into that all the stories (at least here locally) where these managers game the system with byzantine overtime rules which sometimes pad their salaries to even double or triple what their official base pay is. Certainly there can be abuse. But if the public sector pays more at the bottom and less at the top than the private sector, then it would seem to be doing things better. Nobody can call the gap between the top and bottom in the private sector the product of fairness or supply and demand. Its just distorted beyond all sanity. Maybe we should invert the republican mantra, and business should act more like government? business should act more like government? So you want business to be inefficient, insulated from market competition, and able to finance itself by confiscating citizen’s earnings by force? Sounds stupid enough to be Tony. Nobody can call the gap between the top and bottom in the private sector the product of fairness or supply and demand. Sure I could. It depends on the underlying circumstances, but I can think of plenty of cases where it could. Let’s consider an example like Goldman Sachs. That’s a company I fucking hate, so I can’t be accused of being biased in their favor. Goldman Sachs generates very large fees on certain transactions. Handling the underwriting for a major new stock issue, for example, can easily generate fees in the tens or hundreds of millions. You know how you get those transactions? Through relationship sales. Those “financiers” you hear about who get big bonuses? At the end of the day, they’re salesmen. They design and pitch financial instruments to the relatively small set of people who have large transactions like that to bring to market. That means that the difference between landing an underwriting deal worth 8 figures and not landing that deal can often, for Goldman, boil down to the skills of two or three salespeople. So yeah, to Goldman, it makes perfect sense to compensate those salespeople more than the guy who sweeps the floors. The guy who sweeps the floors has absolutely no impact on the outcome of whether or not Goldman gets that hypothetical deal. The salesman does.

Since then the gap has gotten bigger.”  I had four links, but the limit is two, so you’ll just have to get along with these. Or maybe even try to support your lies. sevo showed you his, now why don’t you start providing citations for your made-up numbers? And Tony runs away. What a pussy. United we stand United we stand United we stand United we stand I’m beginning to believe that Obama is interpreting his own election, little more than a repudiation of his predecessor and his policies, as a wholesale endorsement of every Democrat party position. I can’t wait to see the look on his face when it all ends up biting him in the ass. There should be no public sector unions. The ‘protests’ in Madison are a perfect illustration of the gross conflict of interest in having public sector unions. Those unions shout about collusion between politicians and corporations? How about the collusion between the politicians and the unions? They are not loyal American public servants any longer. They are anti-democratic thugs out to line their pockets with tax payers funds. Fire them all. Every last one. I see all of this as a good thing. I encourage the public employee unions to make asses out of themselves. It will be educational for everyone else. This is in the running for the best thread evar! People need to stop talking as though the Dems and the unions are separate entities; they are literally one and the same. The Left has always accused the Repubs of being owned by big business, but the truth is that the unions have literally bought the Dem party and dictate terms to it. It’s just that republicans have been infinitely more successful getting their puppetmasters what they want. But by all indications, apparently that’s freedom. Teachers and janitors defending their salaries? Soshalist conflict of intrest bad evil!!! Toni…Toni…Toni…. You don’t always have to play catcher. I suggest you pitch for once and that just might help with your thought processes. Just a little suggstion. It’s just that republicans have been infinitely more successful getting their puppetmasters what they want. So Republicans are more effective than Democrats? That does not exactly sound like an endorsement of the Democratic Party. Due to the sheer number of Tony posts, I can only conclude that a) there are multiple Tonys or b) he should be writing novels since he can output so much material in such a short time. or c) he’s nuts I’m caught up at the office and don’t have anything better to do, until office hours are over and it’s time to start drinking. So you’re a public sector employee? Makes sense. For the record I work for a private corporation, as in it doesn’t even sell stock. +100000000 🙂 tony, you work for an EVIL CORPORATION!? too bad they don’t know how you feel… wait a minute, bet your Co. has to store all of it’s e-mail… be afraid, be very afraid… President Obama should just keep out of this. I agree. Kudos to those Govenors trying to keep their states functioning… It seems the unions are running out of others peoples money to spend. No this is not how a president should act but then this president hasn’t really acted anything like a president in so many ways whether it is apologizing all day long or sticking his nose in situations where it doesn’t belong. I can only hope the people in this country are as fed up with him as I am and vote him out in 2012. It’s about time this public union feedback loop stopped. Cancel it all. Salon’s Andrew Leonard, who is always good for a larf, has fabricatin’ Joseph McCartin explain to us why FDR would support the union members: Because what happened for the most part over the next 20 years was that collective bargaining worked pretty well in the public sector. The fear-mongering that broke almost immediately when Mayor Wagner signed that act in 1958 never played out. Seriously, the man utterly ignores the 1975 near-bankruptcy. This, my friends, is the left’s “those weapons of mass destruction are in Syria!” moment. I think this would make it “The Kaine Mutiny” As my former governor, I can attest that Kaine is worthless. He wouldn’t even participate on local radio talk shows unless there was an agreement that no phone calls would be taken during his appearance. “The president’s heavy-handed involvement, along with House Republicans’ refusal to sign off on any new bailout of the states, means that this may very well be America’s biggest and most widespread political fight in 2011.” No true libertarian would ever expect the federal government to bail out a state government! Where are the brown shirt comments and outcries about civility? Once the host is destroyed, our power will be even greater! I find it fascinating to see all the libertarian thinkers rooting for government to eliminate the right of individuals to join together and bargain for their working conditions. I guess big government is only evil when it raises taxes or protects the rights of women and black folk. Hi, I’m conducting a poll for trolls that are new to this site. A “troll-poll,” if you will. Please answer the following: 1) How did you find this site? 2) Do you troll at other sites? If so, which ones? 3) Do you have to shield your eyes from the light when emerging from your parents’ basement? Thanks for your participation! 1) friends 2) Yes, list is too long 3) my wife lets me out of the closet and I have to shield my eyes you’re welcome 1)Brick Brats changed my life. 2) Oh, no. This is the D-Lux apartment in the sky of trolling sites. 3) The sun is not my friend. The issue in this case has to do with UNIONIZATION OF PUBLIC EMPLOYEES and their selling their votes to the politicians w/ whom they negotiate pay, benefits, pensions, etc. This is CORRUPTION. John Lee-Ur Correct-public employee unions need to be eliminated. Its not my business to be paying for both there healthcare and retirement also? Screw them. No fair! The host is NOT suppose to bite back! We’ve had enough. We’re taking our marbles home. Better yet, we’re staying in our Beach House for the next few months to recuperate from this nonsense.

We’re here to laugh at brain-dead lefty justifications for coercion; the dumber the better. You and Tony are tied. Ah, so ending collective bargaining rights doesn’t constitute a form of coercion? I’m sure all public servants will work in coercion-free environments once their union rights are stripped away. DJ Bensonhurst|2.18.11 @ 9:59PM|# “Ah, so ending collective bargaining rights doesn’t constitute a form of coercion?” Ah, you stupid shit, no. “I’m sure all public servants will work in coercion-free environments once their union rights are stripped away.” As a brain-dead lefty, I’ll bet you actually think there’s something a rational person could understand in that word salad. Hint: There isn’t. Further hint: “up” /= “down”. And I’m sure both of those are a surprise to such an ignoramus. Oh, and you and Tony are still tied. Hey moron, since when do Homos, blacks and UNIONS deszerve special PRIVILEDGES. Yes, Ive seen what so-called “civil rights” has done to the inner cities. I have nothing to do with 70% illegetimacy. Niether does any UNION have the PRIVILEDGE of asking me to pay for there retirement and healthcare-especially when , as a whole, they do a TERRIBLE job. Please ignore this paleo troll and do not try to conflate his views on civil rights on the rest of us here. Fuck off, ding-a-ling. My queer Jewish inner-city ass has been paying taxes to get you and your Teatard compatriots “your” Medicare and “your” Social Security. I find it fascinating to see all the libertarian thinkers rooting for government to eliminate the right of individuals to join together and bargain for their working conditions. Who here has argued that people should be fined or imprisoned for collective bargaining. People have a right to bargain collectively. And employers have the right to say no. Isn’t all this pointless? Public Sector Unions on one end, Defense Contractors on the other. In the middle there is the corrupt banking sector. The Bedrock of the whole failing system being two generations of Americans who expect full retirement and healthcare benefits. At the end of the Day didn’t Greenspan sum it up by stating they could ensure the money but not the purchasing power of the money. Let them ask for all the benefits they want, they’ll all turn to dust anyways. It’s a real pisser for anyone who actually managed to save any money. Why so? Why so? This issue, and some states’ refusal to implement ACA, will sooner or later get Odumbo to a tipping point: 1. NOT intrude into state level issues and infuriate his base/unions 2. Intrude into issues of state sovereignty and infuriate the country NOT in his base. Gonna be a big one especially if SCOTUS shoots down ACA. I wish my state legislature was short of a qourum and thus not doing a damned thing today. I seriously don’t know why they can’t be compelled to appear by subpoena before an assembly committee, pass legislature to close senate and assembly proceedings, arrest one of the fuckers on contempt, haul his ass back to the senate floor, lock the doors, open senate and vote, unlock doors and wish him well. Preferably arrest him with a SWAT team. Why would dopebama care? This is what the commie moslem grew up on . These mobs of overpayed, lazy, the  Johnny cant read rent-a-mobs are what Dopebama is. He hates America, and he wants the lazy and the stupid with him. Or in the case of the public employee unions , the bribed. Kasich, Walker and Christie have it right. Dopebama, as always, steps in it again. Go off and kiss Soros backside again, Dufus. *groan* WorldNetDaily called. They need their troll back. ^^ This. This thread is rockin’ Nobody can call the gap between the top and bottom in the private sector the product of fairness or supply and demand. I fail to see the unfairness in compensation that is earned via voluntary transactions. The fact that some make more and others less has nothing to do with fairness, unless your moral and ethical development topped out in kindergarten. Oh god the freepers have shown up. On second thought, maybe Glennbeckistan should secede. You’ll be back, hopefully before mass cannibalism sets in. Somalia!111!!!! eleventyone A good take by Robert Reich. As I’ve noted, this demonizing of public employees is premised on false data. Public employees don’t earn more than private-sector workers when you take account of their education. To the contrary, over the last fifteen years the pay of public-sector workers, including teachers, has dropped relative to private-sector employees with the same level of education ? even if you include health and retirement benefits. Moreover, most public employees don’t have generous pensions. After a career with annual pay averaging less than $45,000, the typical newly-retired public employee receives a pension of $19,000 a year. Bargaining rights for public employees haven’t caused state deficits to explode. Some states that deny their employees bargaining rights, such as Nevada, North Carolina, and Arizona, are running big deficits of over 30 percent of spending. Many states that give employees bargaining rights — Massachusetts, New Mexico, and Montana — have small deficits of less than 10 percent. Last year, America’s top thirteen hedge-fund managers earned an average of $1 billion each. One of them took home $5 billion. Much of their income is taxed as capital gains — at 15 percent — due to a tax loophole that Republican members of Congress have steadfastly guarded. If the earnings of those thirteen hedge-fund managers were taxed as ordinary income, the revenues generated would pay the salaries and benefits of over 5 million teachers. Who is more valuable to our society — thirteen hedge-fund managers or 5 million teachers? Let’s make the question even simpler. Who is more valuable: One hedge fund manager or one teacher? Bargaining rights for public employees haven’t caused state deficits to explode *cough*California*cough* Reich is a goddamned tool. Proof by repeated assertion — his favorite rhetorical device, used consistently throughout his career — doesn’t make anything he says any truer today than it was back in the Clinton administration. Also, some of the worst effects of public employee unionization have happened at the municipal level (as witness New York’s near-bankruptcy in 1975), where “deficits” aren’t strictly speaking allowed. Even if it were mere parity, why would public sector workers, who don’t generate any revenue to speak of, get paid the same amount as workers in the private sector, who generate enough revenue to cover their own salaries–and government workers’ salaries too? And when Reich is comparing private industry workers to government workers, how’s he adjusting for professions like firefighters and policemen? I’m not sure there’s much in the way of apples to apples to compare there. And teachers? Here’s a chart for teachers from 2009…  I’m seeing public school teachers getting an average base salary of $49,630 nationally, and private school teachers are getting an average base salary of $36,250… I don’t think that includes benefits, and I suspect public school teachers get more and better benefits. Call it a hunch. So why don’t teachers go start hedge funds? I know, because it’s easier to have all summer off, the risk v. reward has a larger spread, and I don’t know a single teacher with a masters in anything but education which is like a masters in basket weaving, while I can name more than one hedge fund manager with econ degrees, finance degrees, math degrees, one in chemistry… Basically in comparison teachers are fucking dumb. Basically in comparison teachers are fucking dumb. So true. Re: Tony, “As I’ve noted, this demonizing of public employees is premised on false data. Public employees don’t earn more than private-sector workers when you take account of their education.” Reich, you fool – they DO, even when taking into consideration their education (such as it is).  “Bargaining rights for public employees haven’t caused state deficits to explode.” “Somewhere, over the rainboooooow…!” “Some states that deny their employees bargaining rights, such as Nevada, North Carolina, and Arizona, are running big deficits of over 30 percent of spending.” “Hi-ho! Hi-ho!

Stick your fingers in your ears and scream: “I CAN’T HEAR YOU!” Tony|2.18.11 @ 4:47PM|# “A good take by Robert Reich.” There is no such thing; Reich is as predictable and as stupid as you. I can’t speak for the other states mentioned, but until recently, North Carolina was run by Democrats. Sadly, they continued to spend vast amounts of money on non-essential programs even as the recession got worse. Hopefully, the new legislature will be able to establish a responsible budget. You sure can troll but you can’t do math for shit. 13 hedge-fund managers making $1 billion average: $13 billion (assuming a tax rate of 50 percent) income tax on the $13 billion: $6.5 billion divide by 5 million teachers: $1300 per teacher. $1300 is enough for their salaries and pensions? For some teachers it should be. Average city teacher salary tops $100,000 February 18th, 2011 Share | [Milwaukee, Wisconsin] MacIver News Service ? For the first time in history, the average annual compensation for a teacher in the Milwaukee Public School system will exceed $100,000. That staggering figure was revealed last night at a meeting of the MPS School Board. The average salary for an MPS teacher is $56,500. When fringe benefits are factored in, the annual compensation will be $100,005 in 2011. This is what Fat Cats really means and they still want Tax payers to pay for their Health Care and retirement policies ? “So our state is going broke…can we cut $7000 out of your $100,000 a year salary and benefits?” “No Way!!! We will shut down the schools!! We will shut down the Government!!! Go tax the other rich people!!!” sooo…any one read this:  So much for claims that these teachers are poor and under paid. “say our state is going broke can we cut $7000 from your $100,000 a year benifits so our state does not default?” “No way we will shut down the schools!! we will shut down the government!!! Tax the the other rich people!!!”  601 comments!!!! Not all of them stupid!!! EPIC THREAD!!!! over 600!!! E-MAIL I sent to Ed Schultz: Ed, Non-union and private-sector employees are people, too. I’ll bet he finds “hate speech” in it. Tony you care so much for the downtrodden poor, don’t you think that instead of wasting your time here, you could be help out in a soup kitchen or helping out at an orphanage. Being charitable with OTHER peoples money is not charity no matter how much you try to convince yourself how good a person that makes you. Fuck charity and fuck morality. It’s about what makes the most economic sense. Having vast numbers of impoverished people is a direct threat to you and the stability of the society in which you are able to prosper. And you can’t very well prosper if there is no one who can afford to buy the shit you sell. s not always used correctly, as a true “troll” comes not to debate but to throw bombs in an effort to work a forum into a frenzy. But of course, being a nerd, you already knew that. 1) How did you find this site? We were looking for a conservative site to bitch on but like left wing sites conservative sites will not let people post or have heavy moderation. We are incapable of seeing how both sides are equally as stupid on this issue. Conservatives censure us while left wing sites keep the riff raff out and the message pure. 2) Do you troll at other sites? If so, which ones? No…no other site will allow us to post or will moderate us 3) Do you have to shield your eyes from the light when emerging from your parents’ basement? No we work for the government and post during business hours…want a drivers license? HA! the line is empty and the wait is 5 hours you fucking sheeple!!! Just for the record, I don’t think joe belongs on that list. We may not have agreed on much, but I never doubted that joe a) knew what he was talking about and b) put a lot of thought into what he was saying… The other three? I have those doubts every time they type. Tony’s like a Magic 8 ball–he’s always got the same six answers no matter the context… The Truth? He’s like a parrot that’s been trained to talk by listening to someone flip back forth between news channels…he says things, but he has no idea what they mean. Agreed. Joe scrupulously applied clear and consistent logic to a gawd-awful set of premises. Just for the record, I don’t think joe belongs on that list. We may not have agreed on much, but I never doubted that joe a) knew what he was talking about and b) put a lot of thought into what he was saying… I put him on that list because of the context of the questions. ie why do lefties come here.

That being said joe also had demonstrated at times to be even more intentionally deceptive and divisive then Tony has ever been. Basically joe was a better left wing commenter but tony is a better man. He spent too much time playing rhetorical games and misusing wiki entries for my tastes. But he wasn’t all bad when you were off politically charged topics. What, no love for my Maxie? Unions exist to increase their members pay by restricting competition. This is flatly illegal behavior for an other entity. It also requires compulsion and violence to enforce. Sure they should be able to form groups for bargaining purposes. One of the responses available to the entity with the money who is actually purchasing the labor should be “your fired”. And when the entity with the money is the government, it should represent the people who are supposedely “purchasing” the labor, instead of colluding with the union in a big boondoggle/vote-buying scheme. I don’t think that libertarians are against private-sector unions, just in the public sector. I don’t think that libertarians are against private-sector unions, just in the public sector. Only because they can’t figure out a way to be against them and be intellectually coherent. Not that it’s coherent to be against the liberty of public employees to collectively bargain. Tony|2.18.11 @ 12:38PM|# ” I don’t think that libertarians are against private-sector unions, just in the public sector. Only because they can’t figure out a way to be against them and be intellectually coherent.” WOW! A true Gold in the stupidity event! You’re griping *because* libertarians are consistent! Can we print and frame this? It’s gotta be a record! Actually, it’s completely coherent. Even that progressive fucker FDR saw the dangers of public sector unions. They hold the government hostage to their demands for more money Stop trying to guess what people think. You are really bad at it. Believe it or not, I at least, really do believe that people should be able to associate in any way they want, including forming a union and trying to collectively bargain. I also believe that employers should be able to decline to bargain with unions. Unions still have a lot of power without government force behind them. It is not good for a company to have to fire their whole workforce all at once. But the case of public sector unions is different. The legislature controls the purse strings, period. Binding contracts with unions strip them of that power. Stop trying to guess what people think. Tony’s not trying to guess what people think. His method of argumentation is mis-stating an opponent’s position and then attacking the fallacy. He’s a regular internet Ray Bolger Employee—“I have the right to bargain collectively” Employer—“I have the right not to bargain with your collective” (I admit to stretching the definition of “right” for illustrative purposes) Both are right. Until we reach that point, fuck unions, and public employee unions in particular (because I have to pay them but don’t get any say in the process) In context, should be: Freedom, not right I’m only for private-sector unions, and only if one is not forced to join or contribute. Tony? What say you? Addendum: Those who pay union dues get a say in how any portion is spent on political donations. Sounds good to me except I think all workers should have the right to unionize. Look the  public employee benefits look so generous is because everyone else’s have been decimated. I’m not about to endorse destroying the last bastion of the middle class. Allowing public servants to unionize is a hugely bad idea. We’re mostly concerned that employers have the same freedom to NOT be coerced by unions. Employees are given the freedom to associate, but employers would be denied the same freedom. In the public sector, the problem is exacerbated because the unions’ primary weapon is withholding employee production through strikes. In libertopia government services are either so necessary that a strike would be literally endangering lives of citizens OR the employees’ jobs are nont necessary and should be abolished anyhow. Additionally, striking is usually (wrongly) protected from employer retribution. In this case, the state of Wisconsin cannot fire employees who have refused to show up for work in violation of agreed to contract rules. Thanks for this. I agree that a balance must be struck. Do you think that there is a problem with undue coercion of employers by unions? If so, what is the best way to solve that problem? Would it be to take away the right to collectively bargain? Or is there a middle ground? “Do you think that there is a problem with undue coercion of employers by unions?” Yes. “If so, what is the best way to solve that problem? Would it be to take away the right to collectively bargain?” There is no “right” to exclude other workers from bargaining on their own. That’s what is coerced by the government. “Or is there a middle ground?” Like giving the government smaller-caliber weapons? Is there a middle ground between a thief and a victim? The right to collectively bargain does not include the right to be collectively bargained with. You need to brush up on the difference between rights and privileges. The problem is not coercion of employers by unions, but the coercion by government of employers to deal with unions. People should have the freedom to bargain collectively. An employer should also have the freedom to consider a strike a mass resignation. “Shouldn’t people have the freedom to bargain collectively?” But their employers should also have the freedom to tell them to go pound sand and quit if they don’t like it. This becomes complicated when the employers become the government, but then that’s another  to be wary of putting the government in charge of such businesses. There is interesting article on MSNBC frontpage right now is Chuck Todd pseudo-ed-blog thing about the ‘Newtonian’ physics of politics, every action has opposite reaction…blah-blah. Basically its the Republicans now who will face town-hall ire he says, because of what they want to do. Just like the health-care bill! He misses a critical difference. When people read what’s at stake with the Wisconsin tax-suckers, they’re like “Stop crying that you’ve got to pay 12.6% of your healthcare costs.” All the mainstream support seeps away after you get through the jingoisms. With healthcare law, it was exactly the opposite. I don’t think the Toddster grasps that. Neither do any of the other clowns at MSNBC. Basically its the Republicans now who will face town-hall ire he says Interesting. Except it looks like they’re literally facing Town Hall Ire, in that the employees of Town Hall are the ones with the ire. Is this how a President should act? You bet !!! The best historical analogy that comes to mind was JFK’s intervention when Governor Wallace also attempted to thwart the civil rights of his citizens, in that case the integration of the state university. And as I recall, that wasn’t too popular with libertarians, either…. Awesome use of the race card when race isn’t involved at all. Please work in SOMALIA and ROADS too for full credit. And don’t forget to show your work. THIS NOT HOW STEVE SMITH SHOULD ACT. NOT HAVE OPINION, ONLY RAPE. What about opinions on rape? RAPE ONLY NATURAL THING TO DO WITH UNCONSCIOUS HIKER. IF THIS MAKE STEVE WRONG, STEVE NO WANT BE RIGHT. Is this any way for a President to Act? No and Hell No! The Wallace analogy is false because the equal protection clause provided minorities with a civil right not to be segregated by race. There is no civil right to collective bargaining. You have a civil right to freely associate, and you have have civil right to bargain–but that does not mean that the other guy has to bargain with you or your association. Instead, he has a civil right to ignore your association and ask to bargain directly with you. If you don’t want to bargain directly with him, then exercise your civil right to go elsewhere. So a lawfully elected governor and legilsture curring public sector salaries is like Jim Crow? I know we make fun of you for being a man raping ape man and all. But you really are disgusting Steve. You just pissed on the fucking grave of every person who ever suffered under Jim Crow by trivializing their suffering. Wow, dude. So making public servants contribute slightly more to their over-stuffed pensions is the same as hanging niggers from a tree. That’s the kind of intellectual craftsmanship that could spark up a tea light. Steven Smith|2.18.11 @ 12:04PM|# “…The best historical analogy that comes to mind was JFK’s intervention when Governor Wallace also attempted to thwart the civil rights of his citizens…” And you admit that sorry piece of crap is the BEST you can come up with?

I NOW GO RAPE UNION MEMBERS FOR PENANCE. It’s looking more and more like Obama’s politically calculated move to center last all of about sixty days after the November massacre. If he keeps this up, look for his poll numbers to start tanking again in fairly short order. Is it me or has Tony gotten dumber? Or is someone spoofing? I suck at telling when people are spoofing. Judging by the saliva dripping off my cock I’d say it’s the real Tony. I think he has gotten dumber. he seems to be letting The Truth lead on this…co-opting the “teachers are being hurt” meme even though the state capital does not determine teacher benefits…school districts do. Maybe they both get their orders from the same left wing blog. I think he’s just overly emotionally invested in this topic. I imagine at this point his face is red, tears are streaming from his eyes and his voice is nearly hoarse from screaming about how the evil libertarians hate the poor people. I think it’s a spoof. Or he really has gone from just plain stupid to incandescently idiotic. but I do hate poor people… and rich people… and well… It may just be the topic. Some topics really bring out the dumb in some people. You never know, but this sounds like the real Tony. As somebody else pointed out, I think the topic just struck a nerve. So Scott Walker started a war and now the DNC’s and their biggest supporters are fighting it. Personalizing this as something Obama is doing is kind of silly (kind of like calling Walker Hitler). Basically, I would liken this to Rove getting gay marriage on the ballot in as many states as he could to increase evangelical turnout in swing states. These are what special interests do and in a democracy you have special interests – which everyone hates until they are your favorite special interests. If you’re gonna hate (and I do often) then hate both national parties. Hey – I was right there with Greenwald demanding that Rove face prosecution for using federal resources for electioneering purposes. So I do hate both sides. I have no problem with the DNC doing any of this. At all. But if Obama did it, or if any of his staff using WH resources did it, then I do have a problem with it. Just a hunch, but I bet Greenwald won’t be demanding any federal prosecutions over this. And I would be curious to see what Rove actually did and what resources he used. Rove organized and proctored meetings at federal departments where he asked staffers to produce materials trumpeting the success of Bush policies to help with the upcoming election campaign. Isn’t that pretty much the same as what Obama has done with Obama care and all of the federal signs talking about how great the stimulus is? Personally, I would say so. Unfortunately, there appear to be lots of precedents out there for signage referring to the sponsoring legislation and sitting officers behind a particular project. It’s galling, but par for the course. Rove went into uncharted territory. I think Obama is also going into uncharted territory here. The nerve of that man! So Scott Walker started a war and now the DNC’s and their biggest supporters are fighting it. Personalizing this as something Obama is doing is kind of silly Do you know what the URL for Organizing for America? Do you know how URLs and personal names work legally with respect to being able to take a URL that is using your name for purposes you do not wish?  Would you like to rethink your point? actually i thought Christie started it but, it seems there are more people unemployed in neighboring states to Wisconsin that wanted a bus ride and a hot lunch for a few hours of holding Hitler union made Hitler signs and chanting progressive spew… Folks, don’t argue with the communists. Prepare instead, to shoot them where they stand and bury them where they fall. There is no rational argument to be had with thieves. “bury them where they fall.” Buzzards gotta eat and I’m lazy. +1000 Abiss, I’m almost completely certain it’s going to come to that. I’m waiting for the Preston Brooks moment to come again. It’s probably not far off. When it does, I’ll be ready. Jesus, this is like watching the Islamic Student’s Union march on the government. A popular uprising that you’re really, really gonna fear if it prevails. Community Organizer in Chief. Aka, Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers writ large.

(yawn) Tony|2.18.11 @ 12:23PM|# “Yes let’s just do away with public education.” But then who would you blame for your stupidity? Sorry if someone already addressed this, but does anyone have the feeling that this is all going to end in a revolution or a civil war? And soon? Well, I am already gathering powder, shot and wadding, and knapping a few fresh flints… Just in case. I certainly hope it doesn’t, but if it happens, ol’ Leftykiller is locked, loaded, and ready to go. It is after all a casus belli when a Democrat gets elected president. Conservatives are such children. yea we’re all terrified of some fat ol white dudes. We were promised an Abraham Lincoln, and we got a James Buchanan instead. No we got a Jimmy Carter minus the sweater and 3 times the malaise Sorry if someone already addressed this, but does anyone have the feeling that this is all going to end in a revolution or a civil war? And soon? If by “this” you mean a bunch of government employees whining at some Midwest state’s capital…then no. And if you think otherwise then you should seek help. When your revolution comes I’m going to wait it out on the 2nd floor of my house if the fat fucks you see at Tea Party rallies are any indication. After it’s over I’ll clear the heart attack victims from the stairs. None of you are going to do shit but piss and moan on the internet. I visit this site when I want to see impotence in Arial Black. Too bad that’s not the font used. Idiot. Lol, as opposed to the fat white f—s marching in Wisconsin? Have you seen any pics of those people? Hope not. I can’t shoot guns for shit. Now, archery, that I can do. Maybe I’ll get a bow and work up some high tech arrow prototypes. No. That is definitely not going to happen. The case against public sector unionism …The very nature of many public services ? such as policing the streets and putting out fires ? gives government a monopoly or near monopoly; striking public employees could therefore hold the public hostage. As long-time New York Times labor reporter A. H. Raskin wrote in 1968: “The community cannot tolerate the notion that it is defenseless at the hands of organized workers to whom it has entrusted responsibility for essential services.”… This is exactly why Reagan fired the air traffic controllers. Some government functions are simply so critical that you just can’t allow the people carrying them out to hold you hostage. yeaa plus the alzheimers & astrology! Re: Tony, First, it was the moneymakers (not the money earners) who are at fault. Again with the semantic fallacy? A person that makes money also earns it. Only marxoid Statist Fucks believe people that do not toil fields or machinery are not really working. Second, who gives a fuck whose fault it was? What’s important is what makes fiscal sense. That’s a red herring. You cannot overspend and then lay a bill on someone else’s footstep, calling it “fiscal sense.” That’s not continuing to reduce the tax burden on the wealthy and expecting people making less than 50K to pick up the slack. Nobody is asking 50K earners to pick up any slack. Myself, I call for tarring and feathering all public employees and send them to find real productive jobs, instead of plundering us all. You cannot get the economy moving by reducing the spending power of most of the people in the country. Oh yes I can! You think it can’t be done because you’re pathetically ignorant of economics. Re: Tony, Except public employees, I gather. Of course – STEALING is not making or earning. MAKING implies productivity, EARNING implies obtaining it through voluntary exchange. So-called PUBLIC EMPLOYEES receive ALL THEIR MONEY from thieving, from plundering. It’s not possible for policy to enrich the rich, is it? Sure it is possible. So? Only the poor are powerful enough to have government do their bidding, right? The government couldn’t care less about the poor… or anybody, for that matter. Government types only care about government. What some rich companies or people do is at least cull some favors with the almighty state, but that’s an indictment on the State, not on the rich. As long as you’re not conflating public sector workers with the evil bogeyman “the state.” They’re just people looking out after their own interests, and I don’t think there are many private sector workers who do more for their society than teachers. And you know perfectly well that we have a fundamental disagreement about whether taxation is theft. You’re wrong, but you won’t accept it so there’s no point in you ever bringing that argument up again. Tony|2.18.11 @ 1:09PM|# “As long as you’re not conflating public sector workers with the evil bogeyman “the state.” They’re just people looking out after their own interests…,” Bull……………. shit. Using the state to collect money for your salary means you ARE the state. So what? We need a state, and it needs employees. They aren’t evil. In fact many public servants forgo a much higher salary in the private sector in order to contribute to their society. EEEEEVIL! Re: Tony, So what? We need a state, and it needs employees. What’s with this “we” business, Kimosabe? They aren’t evil. Thieves and rent-seekers don’t see themselves as evil either. In fact many public servants forgo a much higher salary in the private sector in order to contribute to their society. EEEEEVIL! So never mind their acts (their thieving, their lies) – it’s their good intentions that count. Right. To the gas chambers go? Talking about classes of human beings in such a broad and viciously negative way betrays something other than clear headed rationality. Re: Tony, To the gas chambers go? Talking about classes of human beings in such a broad and viciously negative way betrays something other than clear headed rationality. You think so, Mr. “The-Wealthy-are-evil”? I judge acts, Tony, not anything else. The ACT of accepting payment that came from thievery is the same as committing theft. Ergo, public servants who are paid with taxes are thieves. That’s a fact. Haha fact. Theft only means something if it is defined legally. It’s not whatever you say it is. Taxation is a user fee for civilization. It’s much more correct to say that not paying taxes is theft. That is, theft of government services. And I don’t think wealthy people are evil. I’m friends with more of them than inal poor people, after all. I just think that they have their interest and by definition the means to secure them, and therefore part of the role of government should be to protect the interests of the nonrich. Taxation is a user fee for civilization. It’s much more correct to say that not paying taxes is theft. That is, theft of government services. If the mob extorts money for protection, it’s not really extortion if they really offer protection. Ah, you mean like the way you talk about the rich and libertarians? You think so, Mr. “The-Wealthy-are-evil”? Ah, you mean like the way you talk about the rich and libertarians? The rich are not a class suspected of discrimination or oppression. They are BY DEFINITION the most privileged of society. This little trope is one of the things in libertarian rhetoric that really needs to die (the idea that the rich are a class of people that need protecting from oppression). You are either deliberately lying or dumb as a box of rocks. I’ve worked both USG and private industry. The USG people were lazy, unmotivated, uninterested, and not half as productive as the private sector workers in the same industry. Public sector workers should not have the right to unionize because the reality is that politicians indebted to public union bosses for their election sat at negotiating tables with those same union bosses and made deals for unsustainable wages and pensions at taxpayer expense. The taxpayer, the actual entity who was being stuck with the bill, had no effective representation at all, which is why he was so badly served. Public unions should be disbanded and public employees barred from having the right to unionize. Nor should they be able to make political contributions. If they’re taking the public’s wage, they have an obligation to remain scrupulously apolitical in the public media. The military knows this and abides by it. So should all other public workers. Mish is all over this and he’s absolutely right. The exorbitant salaries and pensions negotiated to public workers in the past are either going to be repudiated through bankruptcy or taxed back at punitive rates because they are simply unsustainable. Moreover, since they were effectively obtained through fraud and collusion this is exactly what should happen. What’s going on now in Wisconsin is the beneficiaries of criminal activity demonstrating against the fact that some of their ill-gotten gains are going to be removed. They haven’t the slightest bit of moral justification for this action. They just make the situation worse for themselves when you add lying (falsely claiming sick time) and unjustified defamation of character. Walker as Hitler? Really? Give me a break! I hope, for the sake of the taxpayers of Wisconsin, that Walker is their Margaret Thatcher and breaks their public unions utterly beyond any hope of reassembly. The public unions deserve such treatment and worse. So what? We need a state, and it needs employees. They aren’t evil. In fact many public servants forgo a much higher salary in the private sector in order to contribute to their society. EEEEEVIL! reply to this How did Amadou Diallo, Eurie Stamps, and Timothy Cole benefit from the state? I don’t think there are many private sector workers who do more for their society than teachers. Private sector teachers do a better job of teaching then public sector teachers. We should make all teacher jobs private sector jobs, we would get better teachers. What the Governor of Wisconsin is doing is moving in that direction, by exposing public sector teachers to the same market incentives that private sector teachers are exposed to. And private school teachers are on average paid A LOT less than public school teachers. and they don’t get the sweet bennies either… Re: Tony, As long as you’re not conflating public sector workers with the evil bogeyman “the state.” They’re just people looking out after their own interests, So do thieves. […]and I don’t think there are many private sector workers who do more for their society than teachers. Really? Like farmers, for example? You should be careful about what you write, fool. And you know perfectly well that we have a fundamental disagreement about whether taxation is theft. I know – thieves say it isn’t. I disagree. You’re wrong, but you won’t accept it so there’s no point in you ever bringing that argument up again. There’s no point because you simply construe taxation as something else besides the forceful taking of property, as it would make your view of the state that much tacky. Sorry I’m not an anarchist, just like most people. Why don’t you try resting an argument on something else besides a premise almost nobody believes? It’s kind of a cop out. I’m not an anarchist and support taxes on land and corporate value. But taxes on income are theft (I’d call it slavery but we aren’t necessarily forced to work.) That money is our money, and we work for months a year to earn that money only to be forced to hand it over to government on threat of imprisonment and to pay for all the typical elite and politically connected interests while I’m getting next to nothing in return. “I don’t think there are many private sector workers who do more for their society than teachers.” Yeah, it’s a good thing it was the NEA jumping in to offer relief in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and not Wal-Mart. Cause Nagin, Landrieu and the NOLA PD had it all under control!  Ooopsie! *Slaps herself for responding to a troll more than 12 hrs later* Worst. President. In. History. Everything looks worse when you are living through it. Give it a few years and he will blend in with all the other shitty presidents we have had. To take a moment off from reading Tony’s troll posts: What are the odds that the WI Dems can prevent a quorum forever? Who blinks here? Opinions? I don’t see anyway that the Dems can continue to stay away, so they’ll be the ones blinking. Not that the fight will end there. Just a suggestion. Stop the auto-transfer of pay checks; make ’em come in to pick them up. What I don’t understand is why the fuck did they write a law that stops the legislature from running its business if a minority goes on holiday? What if those same people died in a disaster? Do the survivors have to wait for a new election to pass emergency relief legislation? If the government dies, who cares what happens afterward? From their perspective, that is. You need rules about a quorum to make sure legislatures can’t be called into session in the dead of night by 3 guys who then pass laws by votes of 3-0. Why not just make the quorum one vote over half of the body. ie if you have 100 senators 51 can be a quorum. And any vote must get a majority of the 100 to pass. So if 51 form a quorum them they all must vote yes to pass a bill. Wisc. Senate Dems Game Plan: 1) Run to Illinois 2) ? 3) The bad bill goes away I’ve always heard that “shutting down the government” is politically unpopular, but maybe the Dems can succeed where the Repubs failed. I’ve always heard that “shutting down the government” is politically unpopular, but maybe the Dems can succeed where the Repubs failed. They will succeed only because the network media carries water for them. I think it is time to change the quorum rules. They all know perfectly well that there is a quorum call and they are all perfectly capable of getting there and voting. It’s not the 19th century. I say give them a week to show up, then hold the vote anyway and consider everyone who doesn’t show and abstention. Rome really began it’s full stride toward decline when it’s first African – Septimius Severus – was Emperor. Trade declined, inflation soared and public corruption was basically acceptable. Just sayin . . . Fuck off. We don’t need racist fucks cluttering up the blog dude The GOP must be happy to see BHO bleeding his own campaign chest on stuff like this. Oh my, certainly animated comments…so I will jump into the fray! All of the teachers that “called in sick” should be FIRED, immeidately. Secondly, why should public employees be guaranteed benefits at the cost to tax payers, and without any standards? Our education system is falling apart as teachers are more worried about tenure rather than the students and quality of education. I have worked my A** of my entire life, paid into to SS, contributed to my IRA; where is my guarantee of 100% of my salary throughout retirement? This is ridiculous. Think about it people. And Tony should be barred from this site based on his language and overall disrepect for others. I like the cut of your jib, Allie F. 100% of your salary PLUS Social Security and Medicare, lest we forget. If he was Presidential material,it would be different!But he’s NOT………. I wonder if the governor can “compel” the legislature to assemble and vote; I would love to see footage of those clowns being delivered to the Capitol by the state Police. The notion that all of these huge bills being racked up are going to be payed for by “soaking the rich” is as utopian as anything any libertarian ever believed. In the first place, there simply aren’t very many rich folks. Progressives are always going on about what a small percentage of the population they are; well, can you remember that now? Can you work out the implications of that? Namely, that even if you take every last dollar that the “rich” have it won’t be close to enough. Especially since you’ve already figured to use those dollars to “solve” federal revenue problems. And you’re not going to get those last dollars, anyway. Your precious big government, that protector of the little guy? Ha. A plutocrat’s b  can also convince voters into recalling the existing legislature or electing politicians to re-establish their contract (and advertise for them thanks to the Citizens United decision). To argue that this bill somehow oppresses workers’ rights diminishes real events of oppression globally and historically. If you want a real example of oppression of workers by government, try the income tax, which steals workers’ hard-earned money by threat of imprisonment. I don’t enjoy getting robbed for 5+ months worth of salary a year, receiving very little in return. It’s all going to pay for higher-paid upper middle class state workers’ retirements instead of my own. Walter Wit Man|2.21.11 @ 1:27PM|# “[a series of brain-dead lefty lies]…Fuck off and die you terrorist fuckwads. Same back atcha, asshole. In reality, it is the elite capitalists and the political class that have undue influence and have captured our government to funnel the wealth of the productive class to their parasitic hands. Good post, really helpful to me. Thanks for sharing. You’re welcome. If you libertarians had argued to remove the undue political power of corporations as well as unions in Wisconsin, I would have supported that. But you don’t, because you are bad people, so now I hope you all die instead. My hands: tied. God you’re dumb. Learn more about libertarianism before posting things that show you don’t know what you’re talking about. I don’t see the glibertarians here arguing that Walker’s bill is ridiculous. But that’s what it is – it wants to permanently screw over unions over a temporary problem Walker partially caused by buttering up corporations. He isn’t spreading the hurt equally but pursuing a vendetta in a way he did not campaign on. Most of the little insects I see here don’t want to admit that, showing once again that they hate certain entities more than others. Never trust libertarians. From the perspective of non-union taxpayers everywhere, it has been the government that has been completely unwilling to share the hurt. In comparison to private sector, even after passage, public sector workers will still have superior pay, benefits and pensions over private sector workers. And yet they complain? That’s why the rest of us see the public sector unions as the truly greedy ones. I’m in agreement with you on corporations, but that’s got very little to do with the debate we are currently having. As pointed out repeatedly, FDR himself opposed public sector unions. I know there are 1000 comments here and I might’ve missed something, but why didn’t anyone mention to Tony the practical point that soaking the rich doesn’t work? The rich are capable of moving to another place to make their money, hence fleeing areas with higher taxes and going to a place with more favorable ones. The rest of the populace generally doesn’t have this recourse (at least not at the same level). This is even more pronounced when it comes to a state-to-state situation, as opposed to whole different countries. Someone may talk about moving to Costa Rica, but they’re much less likely to do that than move from Madison to Minneapolis. explain the change in debit cards– if it is going to cost me I will just cancel it–debit card is the last thing I have to have—I can use cash,credit cards,checks. explain the change in debit cards– if it is going to cost me I will just cancel it–debit card is the last thing I have to have—I can use cash,credit cards,checks. explain the change in debit cards– if it is going to cost me I will just cancel it–debit card is the last thing I have to have—I can use cash,credit cards,checks. explain the change in debit cards– if it is going to cost me I will just cancel it–debit card is the last thing I have to have—I can use cash,credit cards,checks. explain the change in debit cards– if it is going to cost me I will just cancel it–debit card is the last thing I have to have—I can use cash,credit cards,checks. explain the change in debit cards– if it is going to cost me I will just cancel it–debit card is the last thing I have to have—I can use cash,credit cards,checks. explain the change in debit cards– if it is going to cost me I will just cancel it–debit card is the last thing I have to have—I can use cash,credit cards,checks.

Or had his political operative building counter war protests designed to disrupt the antiwar protests. Or had people protest the California governor over some enviromental law. You would have been calling for his impeachment. This is no different. Bush did quite enough with his anti-protest suppression tactics, secret policy-forming meetings with energy CEOs, oh and torturing people and starting wars based on lies. There’s plenty he deserved to be impeached for. And so that makes it OK for Obama to do the same? You are as bad as MNG Tony. There is nothign Obama does that you won’t defend. How many wars has Obama started under false pretenses again? How many wars has Obama started under false pretenses again? He has continued to fight two wars under false pretenses…and he even promised to end one of them….which he did end…at exactly the time Bush planned on ending it. He continues to the fight the other one. And as a nonpartisan libertarian you’re so not interested in shuffling off as much blame as possible from the actual people who started the wars and onto the guy who inherited them. Why didn’t Obama just snap his fingers and end them? shuffling off as much blame as possible from the actual people who started the wars and onto the guy who inherited them. Obama got more then a few libertarian votes because he said he would end the war. When he did not end it is it not fair that he should receive blame for lying to us? Also Bush is dicking around in some ranch in Texas probably annoying the crap out of his wife. Obama on the other hand is in the white house fucking up the whole country. Bush sucked ass…but he is not the one in power right now. Not just fight. Escalate. Barack or Michelle? Shorter Tony: “But…the other team did it too!” No. The other team is much worse on every single count, and I do not live under the illusion that I have more than 2 choices. Shorter Tony: The other team did it worse! I cannot see but I believe. I apologize for the mass-murdering socialists of the past, but My Party is different: their goals are the same but they would never….. Which is hilarious, because you just accused us libertarians of doing the same thing with Republicans on spending… He’s just trolling folks. We need to stop feeding him. Yes I believe in picking the major party that most reflects your values and influencing it from within. Yes I will call out libertarians when they claim to hare both parties equally but then do free shill work for republicans. So what about when we did “free shill work” as you call it for the Democrats against the Iraq war? Against the Patriot Act? A pittance of intellectual consistency? Congratulations, you still believe all the destructive plutocratic economic policies republicans do, but you sure are against a couple of the most egregious abuses the country has known! Tony, would you prefer being raped by a bear, or by a gorilla? That’s the Team Red/Team Blue “choice” menu. Tony – “Anything is ok if my guy does it”. 5 minutes earlier … I don’t give a shit who the president talks to in public or private And now Obama is doing all of those things too (maybe not starting wars, but continuing and escalating wars based on lies is almost as bad). Tony on Obama, 11:50: I don’t give a shit who the president talks to in public or private Tony on Bush, 11:55: Bush did quite enough with his … secret policy-forming meetings with energy CEOs…There’s plenty he deserved to be impeached for. Glorious. I think it would have been a little different, John. Because if George Bush had done that, it wouldn’t have interfered with the ability of the people of Wisconsin to run their own state government. Barack Obama, on the other hand, may effectively shut down the Wisconsin legislature ’cause he didn’t like what they were doing. That’s a big difference! Oh noo Republicans are all for federalism, like telling women what they can do with their reproductive systems, gay people what are allowed to do with their sex organs, oh yeah, and students which stupid standardized tests they have to pass. None of which has anything to do with Barack Obama interfering with the people’s right to representation! And Tony, you democrats tell everyone what we can do with our incomes, what foods we are allowed to eat and cars to drive and force us to buy health plans we dont want… so please tell me why you think you are so morally superior? You have things you want to force onto people because you think its better for society, and conservatives have things they want to force on people because they think it is better for society. You guys are one in the same – you just have a slightly different view of what “good” is. We are morally superior because we care about the well-being of people other than the most privileged people on earth. Leaving people with the crappy options of the status quo in healthcare does not equal more freedom than giving them better, cheaper options. Yeah Tony you care so much you are willing to sacrifice the education of the children of Madison so you can keep from paying 5% of your pension. Yeah, they really fucking care. “We are morally superior because we care about the well-being of people other than the most privileged people on earth.” That’s why you rich snob Progressives try to stop Wal*Marts from moving into poor neighborhoods. That’s why your disgusting public employee unions fight school choice programs and trap underprivileged children in substandard school districts! There isn’t a political movement in the country that’s done more to hold back the poor than the Progressives. …and now Obama is hiring 1,054 IRS agents to go after poor people who can’t afford to buy health insurance. You should all be ashamed of yourselves! There isn’t a political movement in the country that’s done more to hold back the poor than the Progressives. Yeah, except conservatives, for whom holding back the poor is there raison d’etre. You have to do better than relating the studied wisdom of Professor Beck. I’ve never once watched anything with Beck in it…in my life! …unless Gillespie happened to be covering a live event or something. The Republicans around here hated me for bashing Bush on these pages for pretty much the entirety of his presidency… But I understand! Progressives are indefensible on their treatment of the poor–on three items I just pulled off the top of my head! …so indefensible that you felt it necessary to lash out at me personally. It doesn’t change the truth, Tony. Progressives may tout themselves as being all about helping the poor–doesn’t make it so. Their recent record on the poor is indefensible. …and you just proved that. What recent record? Progressivism has been struggling just to stay relevant during the decades-long dominance of supply-sider bullshit. Sure they haven’t been terribly successful in making society more progressive, but progressives aren’t the ones championing policies that shit on the poor. We’ve had modest success with the election of Obama, though, including the biggest change in the (incidentally budget-killing) healthcare status quo in generations. “What recent record?” All three of those items I mentioned were pulled from the pages of Hit & Run over the past few days! Go look them up yourself. Tony|2.18.11 @ 12:21PM|# We are morally superior because we care about the well-being of people other than the most privileged people on earth. This has got to be a spoof Tony – this is too idiotic even for him. Oh, no he is not. Re: WTF Dude, NOTHING is too idiotic for Tony. We are morally superior because we care about the well-being of people other than the most privileged people on earth. Then write those people a fucking check and leave me out of it. What libertarian have you ever heard defend the status quo of health care? You are so fucking full of shit today, Tony. You really can’t see why this is a totally inappropriate thing for the president to be doing? wind him up and watch him go. —“We are morally superior”— This type of statement scares me, because people who feel they are morally superior have no compunction at all about forcing people to do their bidding. We are morally superior because we care about the well-being of people No you don’t. You’re perfectly happy to take an ever bigger slice of my ever-shrinking paycheck to pay yourself and your supporters ever richer benefits. You don’t “care” — you don’t give a fuck about real working people. It shows in the rhetoric about real poor people that your party indulges in. When a homeless person comes up to the limousine of a prominent liberal politician and the politician shrinks away from the “icky” poor person. When your own presidential candidate described working people in the rust belt as “stupid and bitter” in a high-end wine and cheese party in a San Francisco mansion. And so on. No, you don’t “care.” You feign concern in order to help yourself to other people’s earnings. we care about the well-being of people other than the most privileged people on earth. You’re fucking thieves. Nothing moral about that. you love Sharia law states, cuz your dream progressive state would be very similar. Oh noo Republicans are all for federalism, like telling women what they can do with their reproductive systems, gay people what are allowed to do with their sex organs, oh yeah, and students which stupid standardized tests they have to pass. What federal anti-sodomy laws are there? Because if George Bush had done that, it wouldn’t have interfered with the ability of the people of Wisconsin to run their own state government. Actually if you remember Katrina Bush’s hands were tied by federalism and the left still blamed him for the mistakes of Louisiana’s Governor and New Orleans’ Mayor. Ha… Yes it’s such a strawman when I call you guys Republican cocksuckers. Bush has a well paid team of knob polishers doing his history-rewriting propaganda. Why do you need to do it for free? Bush has a well paid team of knob polishers doing his history-rewriting propaganda. Why do you need to do it for free? So you think the US president should be allowed to just send in troops into any state he wants to when ever he wants to without consent from that state’s government? I know your answer to that question. But as you well know i am a libertarian. Now in your small brain can you conceive of a possibility why as a libertarian I might not want the federal government to have that kind of power? regardless of which blue/red team member is in the white house? I am not defending Bush. I am defending a libertarian value; limiting the power of the federal government. Bush just happened to be the guy that did the right thing….and the left just happened to be the creeps that attacked him for it. I have no favorites…if the roles were reversed I would not have an issue with calling the offending parties out for it. A natural disaster like Katrina is a national issue, and the federal government should have the power to deal with it. And it did. The Bushies, because they agree with you on the role of the federal government (but only apply it to poor black people), seriously dropped the ball. I HATE HATE HATE you cocksuckers, and my guy can do no wrong. If he does it’s Bush’s fault. A natural disaster like Katrina is a national issue, and the federal government should have the power to deal with it. And it did. The Bushies, because they agree with you on the role of the federal government (but only apply it to poor black people), seriously dropped the ball. Then we disagree..I think in order for the federal government to take action in the states it must first follow due process and get permission from the state… but the point is that my position is a principled one….and not about republican worship or a love of Bush like you accused me of. We are not a collection of 50 countries, the nation has its jurisdiction, interests, and responsibilities too. If its role isn’t to respond to large (multi- state) natural disasters, then we might as well just be 50 independent countries. But keep up the good fight, the civil war may be won yet! We are a collection of 50 soverign states with their own elected governments, their own laws, and their own clearly defined local authority to act on emergencies. Otherwise there’s no  to have states. The federal government doesn’t have the authority to do any damn thing it pleases just because someone like you says it should. Don’t like it? Don’t argue with me – argue with the Constitution. Pass an Amendment. Stop whining. The federal government has broad powers, and they are not constrained by your fantasies of what the constitution says. They’re just lines on a map anyway. It is prudent to have governments to fit jurisdictions, and there is some sense to having states with the ability to enact policies to fit their communities. But I don’t think it’s all that important. In the modern world, commerce and society are increasingly homogenized, thus necessitating more policy-making powers on larger scales. Have never understood what’s so libertarian about sanctifying state powers. Have never understood what’s so libertarian about sanctifying state powers. The check on power thing. The states check the power of the federal government and the federal government checks the power of the states. You know, Tony, you’re awfully free with the insults in cyberspace. Somehow I feel that you’d be a bit more reticent in a place where your dental work would almost certainly be rearranged as a consequence of your free expression. Oh irl I’m unflappably polite.  It’s almost cute how Republicunts pee themselves in anticipation of Obama doing something to merit his ouster. Of course he should. If the consequences for the world weren’t so dire, I’d almost hope a Republican gets elected in 2012 just to shut up your incessant whining and pouting. Which consequences would they be, boy? Every fucking week Obama does something that astounds me. Every time, I think he really can’t get any more stupid/craven/dangerous than this, but next week he’ll do it again. The President is using the political power of the Presidency to organize protests… Organizing protests is his only experience and qualification. When all you have is a hammer… True. He was a “community organizer,” and has never had a job apart from that role. If W had devoted staff time and White House resources to organizing protestors to pursue Democrat legislators prior to key votes on his policies, the left would have gone berserk. There’s supposed to be a division between policy and political operations and it doesn’t seem to have be honored here. And they would have had a right to go bizerk. This is downright Nixonian. The reality here is that the teachers “called in sick” AGAIN today, and the taxpayers in Wisconsin who had to rearrange their day to make sure their kids have something else to do since school is closed are none too happy at the Teachers right now. The WI Teachers Union is pulling the same shit the Air Traffic Controllers did with Reagan, and they picked a BAD time to do it. No matter what Obama does, he isn’t governor of Wisconsin and if the teachers keep playing these games they will be out of work eventually. I’m sure you’d take a 7% pay cut forced on you by your political opponents in stride, and thank your employer for the privilege. —“I’m sure you’d take a 7% pay cut forced on you by your political opponents in stride, and thank your employer for the privilege.”— So if I decide to put aside, say 7%, for my retirement, do I get to complain about the pay cut I just took? You can pull your pockets inside out and play kiss the rabbit for all I care. How is that situation analogous to what I described? So what’s the alternative? Bouncing paychecks? That’s what would have happened at my employer years ago if we’d not taken a cut to support the business and ensure no layoffs hit. But then that requires concern for colleagues and for others — not a perpetual assumption that one can just steal an ever larger amount of money from others’ stagnant paychecks to pay for fancy pensions and gold-plated health care. it’s not a pay cut, idiot. They are being told they will have to contribute more of their pay for their health insurance and pension. As a resident of WI and a person who currently contributes 10% of my pay for my health insurance, well my sympathy registers in the negatives. The average retirement age for WI teachers is between 55 and 59. Me, I am quite sure it will be 65 or later. yep, sympathy < 0 Oh, and when my employer increases the percentage I must pay, I don’t get to skip work and picket in front of the CEO’s office. at least I don’t if I want to continue to work. Oh and WEAC (teachers union) strongly suggests that the teachers, upon retirement, go live in Florida because the taxes are lower. There is a very good  why the Governor and the Legislature flipped so hard this last election. A pox on al of them. You are one giant disingenuous prick aren’t you? IT ISN’T A FUCKING PAY CUT. They won’t get paid less, they will have to contribute more to their benefits than they have in the past. And by more I mean SINGLE FUCKING DIGIT PERCENTAGES of increase. I’m sure you remember how sympathetic the nation was to the plight of the ATC workers in the 80’s right? Guess what’s gonna happen this time? Republicans are going to do to the rest of the country what they did to the airlines? Oh, you mean make them affordable to normal people? Actually, Ted Kennedy and Jimmy Carter were the main drivers of airline deregulation. Yeah, I know, hard to believe… Broken clock and all… Carter’s three successes: 1. Airlines 2. Trucking 3. Afghanistan (yes, Reagan finished it, but Carter set up the groundwork which allowed Reagan to succeed) Oh, you mean make them affordable to normal people? If they had not done so, high speed rail would be profitable. Republicans are going to do to the rest of the country what they did to the airlines? What did Republicans do to the airlines? The guy holding the “Scott = HITLERRRRRRR!” sign is probably a history teacher. I’m sure the media will be outraged at the reckless Hitler analogies. remember, we are in the new era of toning down rhetoric… waiting for Ed Schultz to report on this one tonight. “Scott Walker” that is. The Texas Ranger guy? What a fantastic musician… Dumb motherfucker never even heard of Mubarak until it was in the news last week. Short attention span or what? I’ve entertained a notion of carrying a map of the middle east with no names on it. Anyone opening their piehole about said  is presented the map and asked to fill the names in. Less than 80% filled and correct needs to STFU. region, not . Ugh, I should STFU. It’s called an iron law for a . “We are witnessing the logical conclusion of the Democratic Party’s philosophy, and it is this: Your tax dollars exist to make public sector unions happy.” Hear, hear! …although I’d probably take it further than that. The logical conclusion of the Democratic Party’s philosophy is that “We Our tax dollars exist to make the public sector unions happy. Anybody see Rachel Maddow talk about this? Her very distilled point was that if the Parasites lose this one it means the death of the Democratic party. If Glenn Beck had been saying the same stuff it would have sounded like a ridiculous exaggeration. I hope she’s right! …because they’re gonna lose this one. All the spin in the world isn’t gonna make being gouged by public employee unions okay with average Americans. …and the longer this goes on, the worse it’s making the government employees unions look. I’d say that the Democrat party of today will ‘die’ in the sense that it will change very dramatically. Boosh is a Nayzee Time for Obama to have another beer putsch. I mean, summit. Could Obama be brought up on charges of T against the state of Wisconsin? I would call this levying war. “T. Section 10. T against the state shall consist only in levying war against the same, or in adhering to its enemies, giving them aid and comfort. No person shall be convicted of t unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in open court.” That depends. Do you consider nonviolent protesters (however misguided their demands might be) to be the equivalent of an armed rebellion or foreign invasion? If so, please leave your libertarian card here with me, I’ll go get the scissors. “We are witnessing the logical conclusion of the Democratic Party’s philosophy, and it is this: Your tax dollars exist to make public sector unions happy. When we run out of other people’s money to pay for those contracts and promises (most of which are negotiated outside of public view, often between union officials and the politicians that union officials helped elect), then we just need to raise taxes to cover a shortfall that is obviously Wall Street’s fault.” Public Schools are nothing more than a retirement ponzi scheme that uses children as human shields +1000000 Public Schools are nothing more than a retirement ponzi scheme that uses children as human shields Simplify this: Public schools are nothing more than cradle-to-grave daycare for teachers and students. Yes let’s just do away with public education. The better to create an underclass of slave workers for those oh-so-victimized employers you spend all your time fellating. Gay Kettle? You’re black. Yes let’s just do away with public education. Might as well considering the quality of public education these days. Public education is needed to create an underclass of slave workers for those oh-so-victimized employers voters for the benevolent progressive ruling class FIFY Yes let’s just do away with public education. The better to create an underclass of slave workers for those oh-so-victimized employers you spend all your time fellating. Public schools already do that. Why waste the money? I think that they are a bit more than that. But not too much at this point. we can demand an effective 7% pay cut for teachers. Wrong. We want them to pay for what they are currently demanding for free. Like, you know, normal people. Why are Libertarians anti-union? Shouldn’t people have the freedom to bargain collectively? Or do Libertarians believe that this should be regulated by the government? Please educate me. Re: horchata, Why are Libertarians anti-union? First of all, don’t you dare call yourself after my favorite rice drink. Second, nobody here is against unions. Libertarians are against COERCION. Shouldn’t people have the freedom to bargain collectively? Yes, and equally employers have the right to tell union collective bargainers to go fuck themselves. Statist fucks believe employers are plutocrats that deserve to be coerced by government fiat. Or do Libertarians believe that this should be regulated by the government? Government ‘regulation’ requires COERCION, a sine qua non, so clearly, being against coercion would mean being against government action. QED. Please educate me. Really? I’m skeptical – when I see it, I’ll believe it. There used to be a burrito place here in Cleveland that had lovely horchata, but now it’s gone. I doubt if there’s good horchata anywhere within 300 miles now. So very sad. Old Mexican. How dare you name yourself after many of my favorite people. And, thanks for the response. In the Wisconsin case the state government is trying to take away the people’s right to bargain collectively, while the President is interceding on their behalf. Shouldn’t a libertarian agree with the President on this? Because we also believe that the employer (in this case, the government of Wisconsin) has the freedom to tell the union to fuck off. Nice try though*, thanks for playing! *It really wasn’t a very nice try. It was abysmally ignorant. Is it a libertarian position that governments should have the right to tell people to ‘fuck off’? Yes. There was an election. They lost. They now want to intimidate the lawfully elected representatives into disobeying the wishes of the electorate. If their natural rights (rather than their civilly-granted “rights”) were being threatened, I would feel some sympathy. That’s not the case, though. I believe Governor Walker should phrase his message more artfully than that, but you got the gist right. “Yes. There was an election. They lost. They now want to intimidate the lawfully elected representatives into disobeying the wishes of the electorate.” We’re cool with that. When it comes to employment, absolutely. Working in the service of the people is an honor for the worthy, not a right. I’m going to go ask the government for a billion dollars. When they tell me no, I’m going to file a civil discrimination lawsuit because they told me no. I win! “In the Wisconsin case the state government is trying to take away the people’s right to bargain collectively,” Re read, (or read for the first time) OM’s response. BTW, there is no “right” to bargain collectively; that is a favor granted by the government. BTW, there is no “right” to bargain collectively; that is a favor granted by the government. Then there is no right to start a business and make money, that’s just a favor granted by government. Re: Tony, Then there is no right to start a business and make money, that’s just a favor granted by government. Tell that to the black market taxi drivers and hairdressers. People ACT, whether the government likes it or not. Collective bargaining only works when government coerces employers to bargain with collective bargainers EXCLUSIVELY. This is called “racketeering”. Under any other circumstance, employers can tell collective bargainers to go fuck themselves. Then there is no right to start a shitty business that treats its customers as the enemy and tries to rip them off to the greatest extent possible and make money, that’s just a favor granted by government. See, now it’s not just a better analogy for unions, it’s a criticism of rent-seeking too! Re: Horchata, Old Mexican. How dare you name yourself after many of my favorite people. Maybe because I happen to be Mexican. In the Wisconsin case the state government is trying to take away the people’s right to bargain collectively That’s not true. The government of Wisconsin is simply putting into law that the government will not bargain with collective bargainers. A person does NOT have a right to coerce someone into bargaining with him or her, no matter if collectively or not. ….while the President is interceding on their behalf. Actually, he is just giving his opinion. Not that it matters, he can’t do anything. Shouldn’t a libertarian agree with the President on this? A libertarian can do whatever the fuck he or she pleases. *I* don’t agree with the President and I would not agree with him even if I weren’t libertarian, as it is not his fucking business. Thanks for the discussion, Old Mexican. I agree that it’s ‘not his fucking business’. Read the Fucking Library Collection because you are completely lost in a maze of ignorance, moron. Not if the union is public. Libertarians generally don’t want to recognize a federally granted right for public workers to bargain for funds that come from taxation. It would seem to be the heart of libertarianism, actually, because you have services that might otherwise be private, and you have tax dollars funding these services, and the only requirement for any sort of bargaining — initially only private — came from a federal law to do so, a law overseen by what was probably one of the most economically collectivist presidents in our history. I hope that makes sense. somehow i missed that in the “Inalienable Rights” part… Hi, I’m conducting a poll for trolls that are new to this site. A “troll-poll,” if you will.

I use to troll Environmental Economics blog…but now you have to sign in with facebook or some shit so i stopped posting…i still read it. 3. yes Wait…am i a troll? Anyone who uses the term “troll” is a ridiculous nerd, and it’s almost never used correctly here, as it is not a term for someone who merely disagrees with you. Ok so you are not a troll…we get it. You are an earnest leftist who comes here to bitch at all of us liberatards. But the questions were obviously directed at you…and i am sure quite a few people are wondering how you would answer at the least the first two questions. Fine I’ll humor you. 1) I found this site via Arts & Letters Daily. 2) I post on some liberal sites, such as Salon, Huffpost, and Slate but mostly here, because for some  I only like debating with people I disagree with, rather than circle jerking with those I agree with. And frankly you guys are the least insane of the right-wing internet community. 2) I post on some liberal sites, such as Salon, Huffpost, and Slate but mostly here, because for some  I only like debating with people I disagree with, rather than circle jerking with those I agree with. And frankly you guys are the least insane of the right-wing internet community. LOL. While we are almost diametrically opposite in ideology, I totally agree with you in this regard. I wouldn’t spend much time in the comments section if not for you, MNG, Chad and the few antagonists that pop up now and then. I can’t listen to talk radio anymore because I tire of the echo chamber that is perpetuated by most hosts. If I can’t support my beliefs against an opponent, then it better to not even bother thinking. I’ve got to admit that I respect your determination to continue taking the insults from this board. Thank you. And there’s a lot I disagree about with some hardcore liberals, especially in the idealism vs. pragmatism realm. But for some  they’re even nastier and less pleasant than the folks here, so I can’t take much of that. “But for some  they’re even nastier and less pleasant than the folks here” That would be because the vast majority of their arguments revolve around the Ad Hominem fallacy. Rather than engage a person’s argument they engage the person, and that often gets really nasty. Didn’t they teach you that one in Fallacy school, or were you too busy performing fallatio on the professor? I see what you did there. And frankly you guys are the least insane of the right-wing internet community. You are aware that this is not a right-wing website, right? You are aware that this is not a right-wing website, right? Yeah like everything else here, that’s the case in theory, if not practice. Yeah, pot-smoking bisexual atheists are really hard-right-wingers. It means there’s hope, you just gotta stop believing everything the republican/ chamber of commerece propaganda mill feeds you. For once, you’re on to something. The correct term is goblin. In Tony’s case it’s knob-gobbling goblin. “Anyone who uses the term “troll” is a ridiculous nerd, and it’s almost never used correctly here, as it is not a term for someone who merely disagrees with you.” Anyone who gets into an internet argument over the meaning of the term “troll” is definitely a nerd. Actually, anyone in an internet argument is a nerd until proven otherwise. P.S. – You are correct, the word troll i at, but you never spend any time bellyaching about the special favors corporations receive, which amounts to so much more in unjustifiable welfare. My problem is that you don’t apply this principle consistently, because it seems to be filtered through a class-based lens. As in, poor people are icky and dirty and morally unfit, so they don’t deserve a crumb, and rich people are nice and pure and good, so all the welfare they receive can be overlooked. They deserve it. Are you freaking kidding? We bellyache about corporate welfare all the time. You’re officially trolling. No you don’t. The only time you ever mention corporate welfare is when someone accuses you of not caring about it. That means it’s, at best, something you care about in theory. Then you carry on trashing on the poor and downtrodden and claiming they’re bringing society down with all their political muscle. poor working-pals, Tone-Tone: Insolvent Diane Feinstein, Busted Harry Reid, Poor Nancy Pelosi, the Kennedy Paupers, and all the rest of the “for the poor” gang. Allowing a corporation to keep its own money, aka lower taxes, is not welfare. Giving a corporation money that belongs to someone else, aka crony capitalism, is welfare. ^^THIS^^ “poor people are icky and dirty” Which is basically how you treated me in a thread a few days ago, because I don’t make some magical minimum amount of money. Well poor people are icky, that’s objective fact. The difference is I am not basing my economic policy around punishing them for it. You just showed your true elitist-fuck colors, Tony. Oh, and… fuck off. As in, poor people are icky and dirty and morally unfit, so they don’t deserve a crumb, and rich people are nice and pure and good, so all the welfare they receive can be overlooked. They deserve it. Rich people are not, on average, nice and pure and good, but, on average, they are nicer and purer and gooder than poor people. Party of the rich Hello Toni honey, it’s me.

So ramming a special interest law through with no review, after meeting with industry leaders and carving out special exemptions for them is cool with you. Which is what Obama and Bush both have been guilty of and is what’s pushing us further into debt. Congrats! That’s so incoherent and one-sided it’s really amazing you can state it and then rail against us for objecting when both parties do it. Are you just playing a huge joke on us? It’s not cool with me. But I’m aware that the decades Republicans have been spending giving power to corporate interests is not something that goes away with the election of a Democrat. That’s why it’s called power. If negotiating with those power centers means getting some good policy, so be it. It’s better than them using their power to completely destroy any attempts at good policy at all, which they were perfectly capable of doing. Of course it’s one sided. Tony doesn’t believe in any absolute right and wrong. He has been explicit on this point. Therefore, his morality revolves around defending the side he has chosen. His loyalty to the statists has no moral of a philosophical underpinning than a dog’s loyalty to the turf he has chosen. *no more of a philosophical … It absolutely has a moral underpinning. A much, much better one than libertarians have. I just happen to believe that separating real-world consequences from morality is itself an immoral stance. But how are you judging what is a better? Remember, it has to be pragmatic, so any standard you use is invalid if I pragmatically decide so.

I suppose it’s OK when the president holds secret meetings with industry leaders in order to facilitate their every wish. Union leaders yes. Industry leaders no. Except for the financial industry, they support dems, so thy’re ok. Oh and corporate leaders that are sucking on the government teat, they’re ok too. “Why shouldn’t the president do whatever is within his legal ability to push back against the plutocrats? ” I’d settle for him not putting them in charge of the henhouse, *cough*geithner*cough*. The president doesn’t give a shit about fighting plutocrats, all he cares about is that, whether the people are getting chomped by megasharks like Goldman Sachs CEOs or ripped to pieces by piranhas like the pubsec unions, he and his gang of hyenas get their share of the leftovers. in what world do you live that republicans are the only corporartists? Is corpratism not corpratism if its done in the name of carbon credits or green energy? He explains that.

And that is the sum total of his ‘argumentation’. Color me shocked if there isn’t a financial connection to Tony’s ‘advocacy’. I suppose it’s OK when the president holds secret meetings with industry leaders in order to facilitate their every wish. Obama seemed to think it was OK when he had talks with insurance companies about ObamaCare. did you really use the term Plutocrats? That’s like something out of communist indoctrination literature from the 50’s. Very retro, I like Plutocrats? talking out of Uranus again… Tony means mommy and daddy since he grew up in a wealthy family. He thinks those 2 evil plutocrats should be punished by funding incompetent teachers and cops who can’t be fired. He is a fucked up kid with serious issues. Listen up, Republicans: if you cannot conjure up a nominee capable of kicking this moron out of the White House…. Oh, if anybody can fuck up winning in 2012, it’s the Republicans. You’re talking about the same stodgy, pompous, clueless assholes who nominated Bob “Viagra” Dole to defeat Bill Clinton, the smoothest, slickest-talking president in history.

He was more nuanced than that. He might say that at his most disingenious moments, but he had to work himself up to it in the course of mounting an increasingly desperate defense of some poorly thought out yet seemingly able comment he had made earlier that prompted the regulars to hand him his ass on a platter. Well, MNG would argue that ‘regulate’ means ‘make rules about’, and that education has an effect on ‘interstate commerce’, so therefore the federal government can of course make any rules they like about education, including how the states must compensate education workers. QED! The teachers’ union is primarily a negative influence on the quality of education, as much of its efforts go into protecting the worst teachers from accountability for their failures. Or are you one of those trendy suckers who assume that if something is ridiculously expensive, it must be good? What, no blather about Chinese trains? I think zombie Tricky Dick is waiting in the wings, as we speak. I do not doubt for an instant the Chairwarmer-in-Chief of this country devoutly believes we need wage and price controls in the private sector. naw, nixon effed that up The public sector guys fucked themselves when they got out of sync with the private unions. You think the Steelworkers and Pipefitters, who are spending their dues on supporting an ever growing number of out-of-work members, are going to show solidarity with these people who are screaming about contributing 6% to their state guaranteed pension? I’m thinking not. An interesting point. I’ve worked with many an industrial union member, and the ones that work as contractors generally work quite hard with quality results. It’s when you get an employees’, as opposed to a contractors’ union, that the productivity:pay ratio drops significantly. Union contractors understand that they have to perform to get called back. We are witnessing the logical conclusion of the Democratic Party’s philosophy, and it is this: Your tax dollars exist to make public sector unions happy. When we run out of other people’s money to pay for those contracts and promises (most of which are negotiated outside of public view, often between union officials and the politicians that union officials helped elect), then we just need to raise taxes to cover a shortfall that is obviously Wall Street’s fault. Anyone who doesn’t agree is a bully, and might just bear an uncanny resemblance to Hitler. I think Matt has been reading The Truth’s comments. “then we just need to raise taxes to cover a shortfall that is obviously Wall Street’s fault. Anyone who doesn’t agree is a bully, and might just bear an uncanny resemblance to Hitler.” I’d say a good paraphrase of Tony and da troof. I don’t get why it’s so obvious that we can’t raise taxes on the rich to cover budget shortfalls, but we can demand an effective 7% pay cut for teachers. Is it really the latter who are living too large? Is it really the latter who are living too large? Yes. It really is the latter. The cost of the salaries and the pensions are crowding out every other government priority. Some of us never had benefits and have taken 10%+ cuts in pay to keep our jobs in the last 2 years. Imagine how little I give a shit that teachers are taking smaller cuts to keep theirs. Because public sector workers should have to have as shitty a situation as the rest of us. Just as long as we don’t touch the pockets of the poor wittle billionaires!

Congress and the Fed are laughing all the way to the bank. I have too suffered during this recession, Tony. Stop denying it! Just last week my beloved Jerold had to be shown the door. Hard to believe he couldn’t pull down some serious money in our little escort business with that incwedably tight ass of his, but his heart wasn’t really into it. But the people who actually caused the recession are making more money than ever. They sure are, thanks to us! We Greedy Public Unions are the only ones who shouldn’t have to “share” the burden. Man, it’s always THIS argument… We can’t do anything to these millions of people who are grinding the system to a halt with their demands on the public funds, because there’s a bunch of billionaires out there who are paying nothing into the system. What??? What does one have to do with another? And it’s easy enough to disprove with data. But no matter, it’s a whole lot easier to pander to class warfare. Tony|2.18.11 @ 11:48AM|# Because public sector workers should have to have as shitty a situation as the rest of us. Just as long as we don’t touch the pockets of the poor wittle billionaires! Because the people being forced to pay for this are private sector workers, and you seem to think they ought to keep getting ass-raped so that their earnings can provide better compensation and benefits to the government employees then they get themselves. Fuck off, slaver. Because public sector workers should have to have as shitty a situation as the rest of us. Just as long as we don’t touch the pockets of the poor wittle billionaires! Working people are paying for teacher salaries & benefits, Tony, and they just can’t afford never-ending increases. What you want is for people struggling to make ends meet to keep paying for raises and gold plated benefits for another group of people, for no  other than their membership in a protected class. No, I want the wealthy to pay for it. Why isn’t 34.5% enough, Tony? It’s more than enough if we got rid of the loopholes and giveaways. I guess we’re making progress. Tony appears to be endorsing the flat tax.  The top ten percent paid Nearly 75% of all taxes in 08. Fucking citations, how do they work? Bullshit. You tax’n’spenders want 90% tax rates. Because public sector workers should have to have as shitty a situation as the rest of us. Just as long as we don’t touch the pockets of the poor wittle billionaires! What did you do to deserve a portion of the billionaire’s money. The teachers have jumped the shark. No one sympathizes with them. Other than the President, that is. Tony|2.18.11 @ 11:44AM|# “I don’t get why it’s so obvious that we can’t raise taxes on the rich to cover budget shortfalls, but we can demand an effective 7% pay cut for teachers.” Please point out your ignorance to those who haven’t figured it out by now. I don’t care and am not surprised you ‘don’t get it’. So why don’t you educate me? Oh, because you’re sevo, and you never do anything but hurl insults and claim to be right without ever offering a cogent argument about anything. Re: Tony, So why don’t you educate me? Oh, because you’re sevo, and you never do anything but hurl insults and claim to be right without ever offering a cogent argument about anything. I’ll educate you: “I don’t get why it’s so obvious that we can’t raise taxes on the rich to cover budget shortfalls” Because it was not the GODDAMNED FAULT OF THE so-called rich that the GOVERNMENT CAN’T DO ANYTHING RIGHT! That’s why. Asshole. First, it was the moneymakers (not the money earners) who are at fault. Second, who gives a fuck whose fault it was? What’s important is what makes fiscal sense. That’s not continuing to reduce the tax burden on the wealthy and expecting people making less than 50K to pick up the slack. You cannot get the economy moving by reducing the spending power of most of the people in the country. “First, it was the moneymakers (not the money earners) who are at fault. Second, who gives a fuck whose fault it was?” Third, go suck a diseased cock, Tony. Re: Tony, First, it was the moneymakers (not the money earners) who are at fault. Again with the semantic fallacy? A person that makes money also earns it. Only marxoid Statist Fucks believe people that do not toil fields or machinery are not really working. Second, who gives a fuck whose fault it was? What’s important is what makes fiscal sense. That’s a red herring. You cannot overspend and then lay a bill on someone else’s footstep, calling it “fiscal sense.” That’s not continuing to reduce the tax burden on the wealthy and expecting people making less than 50K to pick up the slack. Nobody is asking 50K earners to pick up any slack. Myself, I call for tarring and feathering all public employees and send them to find real productive jobs, instead of plundering us all. You cannot get the economy moving by reducing the spending power of most of the people in the country. Oh yes I can! You think it can’t be done because you’re pathetically ignorant of economics. A person that makes money also earns it. Except public employees, I gather. It’s not possible for policy to enrich the rich, is it? Only the poor are powerful enough to have government do their bidding, right? Only the poor are powerful enough to have government do their bidding, right? Government workers are not ‘poor’, asshole. They are compensated on average at a significantly higher rate than comparable private sector workers, who are being told by fucksticks like you that they should sacrifice even more to continue to provide government workers with compensation far in excess of what they get themselves. Fuck off, slaver. Re: Tony, Except public employees, I gather. Of course – STEALING is not making or earning. MAKING implies productivity, EARNING implies obtaining it through voluntary exchange. So-called PUBLIC EMPLOYEES receive ALL THEIR MONEY from thieving, from plundering. It’s not possible for policy to enrich the rich, is it? Sure it is possible. So? Only the poor are powerful enough to have government do their bidding, right? The government couldn’t care less about the poor… or anybody, for that matter. Government types only care about government. What some rich companies or people do is at least cull some favors with the almighty state, but that’s an indictment on the State, not on the rich. …it was the moneymakers (not the money earners) who are at fault. I would love to hear the doubtlessly hilarious explanation of this distinction. earners of all they get. They have grossly bloated levels of compensation. If you can make that determination about public workers then I can make the same about people who make 3000 times they do and produce less. No you can’t, because the guy who makes 3,000 times more typically produces more — real wealth, jobs and economic activity — while the public “worker” just steals money from everyone else’s paycheck to perform 5 to 6 hours’ worth of work in a 38-hour work week, at a 150% premium to the market rate. I can make the same about people who make 3000 times they do and produce less. Nope. If the compensation for the ‘rich’ is too high, then the company will go BK, (unless you have a friendly administration to bail you out) while gubment workers are all but guaranteed employment. You’re full of shit. You’re arguing that pubsec union workers are just as productive as the private sector, and at the same time decrying the implementation of a system that would actually treat them as such. “I don’t get why it’s so obvious that we can’t raise taxes on the rich to cover budget shortfalls…” Because union benefits were set to rise higher than the price of inflation… The problem isn’t a lack of revenue; it’s that the government employees wages and benefits are set to rise above the rate of inflation! You make it sound like the solution to drunken sailors spending too much money is giving them more money to spend. …and that just doesn’t make any sense to anybody. …and that just doesn’t make any sense to anybody. …except drunken sailors. …and that just doesn’t make any sense to anybody. …except drunken sailors. …and Tony Tony the drunken sailor His beach house is just out of frame. Did he mention he had a beach house? Also, he fully expects taxpayers to pay for the damage, somehow. Fuck you. …demand an effective 7% pay cut for teachers… Maybe that means their benefits were too generous before, not too small now. How would you like a 7% pay cut? How would you like it if it came about because your political opponents unilaterally decided just to snatch it from you? These are real people, and like most workers in this country can’t absorb cuts like this. If this was actually in the service of fiscal soundness, that would be one thing, but it’s not. It’s political warfare. The people of Wisconsin have a right to legislate their own budget, Tony. Even if Barack Obama hates them for it. “How would you like a 7% pay cut? How would you like it if it came about because your political opponents unilaterally decided just to snatch it from you?” How does Tony not see the irony in this re: his constant argument for higher tax rates. Well how come government employees have to make tough choices? How come working taxpayers never have to make any tough choices?! /sarcasm They should be fired for violating the terms of their contract by calling in sick without actually being sick. Then they can be replaced by people who are happy to take on the job at a lower salary. Sympathetic doctors who give them fake doctor’s notes should be stripped of their license and put in prison for defrauding the state government. That’s much better than giving them a pay cut. How would you like a 7% pay cut? I’d have to slash my monocle budget in half. How would you like a 7% pay cut? Given inflation and my recent (small or non-existent, depending on the year) raises, I’d say I’ve been given one. But I have neither the power nor the inclination to browbeat others into taking a “pay cut” via higher taxes so that my salary and benefits continue to grow. Right, because unlike everybody else, they are entitled to that pay. That’s the important thing to remember. Entitled. Ok, I usually just read all you folks. But Tony’s argument here is just over the top stupid. It is NOT a paycut to have to contribute to YOUR OWN retirement and heath insurance! If they don’t want to pay a portion of the costs for things that are benefiting them, then maybe they should opt out of the state provided pension & healthcare insurance plans. The average teacher in Wisconsin is making $77+k a year. They can afford to cover some of their own costs. ^This.^ Thank you, flicka47. How would you like a 7% pay cut? I took a 25% one to help tide my employer through the recession. Then again, I care about my coworkers and the health of my employer. I wish I could say the same for a bloated public union, which has only contempt for the struggling working people who richly line their nest. These are real people, and like most workers in this country can’t absorb cuts like this. If this was actually in the service of fiscal soundness, that would be one thing, but it’s not. It’s political warfare. Then they should get another fucking job. I always love these kind of comments, because the presumption is that peoples incomes belong to society as a whole. Is it really the latter who are living too large? Actually you and Teh Troof have been bitching about teachers but school districts determine their wages not the state capital. You are intentionally lying Tony. The people who will see the big cuts are not teachers. The rich don’t just live large on their income, they put a much greater portion of it towards investment because their base consumption needs are already met. If we were talking about a progressive consumption tax, you’d have a better point; consuming your seedcorn is a bad idea, even if times are a little rough. I don’t get why it’s so obvious that we can’t raise taxes on the rich to cover budget shortfalls, but we can demand an effective 7% pay cut for teachers. Cuz Wisconsin gets its revenues from sales and property taxes. Sales are down because they have over 10% unemployment and property values are down because…well if you don’t know you are blind and dumb. if they raise any of those taxes it will only lower sales and lower property values…thus no gain. If they invent a new “Tax the rich” tax then the rich will leave or stop working and stop hiring….thus again the government still has low revenues and can’t pay its employees. it should also be noted that teachers are not payed by the state. So technically it will be up to the the various school districts and their budgets how much teacher pay/benifits is to be cut. Anotehr note: If school districts do not have to deal with collecive bargining they can choose who to hire and who to fire. They can now get rid of the crappy teachers and pay the good teachers more on merit and ability rather then seniority. Cuts are inevitable…the economy says so. By taking away collective bargaining the districts can mitigate the damage this will have on the actual service they are providing…which is believe it or not to teach children. I know it is hard to believe but the purpose of schools and their teachers is not to pay union members….its purpose is to teach kids. Far out claim I know….but a true one. Well, no. That is not the “collective bargaining” they’d be dealing with. The Wisconsin law would only limit collective bargaining for pay increases. Instead of negotiating yearly raises, those raises would instead be based on the Consumer Price Index, unless the voters approved a wage increase. So, in reality raises would be a COLA. More than most non-government folks get. Other negotiating between the gov’t and the union would still take place, though obviously more limited in scope. And unions would still represent workers in individual employee/employer disputes. People who work for the government are PUBLIC SERVANTS, they are there to serve us, they should be grateful for the PRIVILEGE of working for us at our expense. They shouldn’t even have unions. And I don’t want to hear about how they pay taxes to. That’s like you giving me $100 dollars, me losing it in Las Vegas, and then bitching that I lost my money when I actually lost yours.

What the hell right does the President have to interfere with the politics of a state? The President is using the political power of the Presidency to organize protests agaisnt a lawfully elected govenor and legilsture of a state engaged in state business. That is appalling. That rises to the level of a high crime or misdemeaor. It’s almost cute how Republicunts pee themselves in anticipation of Obama doing something to merit his ouster. If the consequences for the world weren’t so dire, I’d almost hope a Republican gets elected in 2012 just to shut up your incessant whining and pouting. Tony|2.18.11 @ 11:47AM|# “…Republicunts…” You should save that for recess. Your 1st grade classmates will just howl with laughter. This is a lot to expect of you I know. But use your imagination. What if George Bush would have had the West Wing creating pro iraq war prot You are now logged in. Forgot your password? Create new account Government Spending Matt Welch | 2.18.2011 11:19 AM From the Washington Post: The president's political machine worked in close coordination Thursday with state and national union officials to mobilize thousands of protesters to gather in Madison and to plan similar demonstrations in other state capitals. Their efforts began to spread, as thousands of labor supporters turned out for a hearing in Columbus, Ohio, to protest a measure from Gov. John Kasich (R) that would cut collective-bargaining rights. By the end of the day, Democratic Party officials were working to organize additional demonstrations in Ohio and Indiana, where an effort is underway to trim benefits for public workers. Some union activists predicted similar protests in Missouri, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. […] The White House political operation, Organizing for America, got involved Monday, after Democratic National Committee Chairman Timothy M. Kaine, a former Virginia governor, spoke to union leaders in Madison, a party official said. The group made phone calls, distributed messages via Twitter and Facebook, and sent e-mails to its state and national lists to try to build crowds for rallies Wednesday and Thursday, a party official said. Just think–there once was a time (for more than a century, actually), when the president of the United States thought it too imperious to deliver the State of the Union via a speech to a joint session of Congress, since that would smack of telling a co-equal branch of government what to do. Now we have a president not just taking rhetorical sides in a state issue, but actively mobilizing his political organization to affect the outcome(s), even though (to my knowledge) nothing that Gov. Walker or any other belated statehouse cost-cutter is doing has a damned thing to do with federal law. I have written in the past about how libertarians are pretty lonely in the political scheme of things in terms of constantly being challenged to defend themselves against the ""logical conclusion"" of their philosophy. But I think it's time to amend that. We are witnessing the logical conclusion of the Democratic Party's philosophy, and it is this: Your tax dollars exist to make public sector unions happy. When we run out of other people's money to pay for those contracts and promises (most of which are negotiated outside of public view, often between union officials and the politicians that union officials helped elect), then we just need to raise taxes to cover a shortfall that is obviously Wall Street's fault. Anyone who doesn't agree is a bully, and might just bear an uncanny resemblance to Hitler. The president's heavy-handed involvement, along with House Republicans' refusal to sign off on any new bailout of the states, means that this may very well be America's biggest and most widespread political fight in 2011. It's a cage match to determine first dibs on a shrinking pie. A clarifying moment. NEXT: In the Long Run, Are We All Undead? Matt Welch is an editor at large at .

Looky there, one time that stupid licensing laws come in handy. In obama’s eyes he is fighting slavery and this is his little rock. Are they issuing cold weather gear to 3/82nd Abn? Perfect for his base seeing an airborne invasion in WI to battle the evil Nazi Replicans. Are they going to restore basic government services by teaching classes and serving school lunches to poor kids? I don’t think that would play so well to TEAM BLUE when some $19K/yr private with a GED is teaching the same class better. It’s the 3rd Infantry 1st BCT and 10th Mountain that are training in the US for operations in the US. maybe that’s why the army has requested rubber bullets? Old, but still relevant.  I think Ft. Drum still has government 101 as well. (but that’s prefaced with being applicable to running cities in Afghanistan and Iraq, cause you know those cities run just like US cities) It is an interesting thought. Wisconsin law calls for the revocation of the license of any educator for incompetence if it “endangers the health, welfare, safety or education of any pupil” which would probably apply to multiple sick days so that schools are canceled. And if they aren’t sick it is immoral behavior. Hmm, revoke the licenses then the schools will have to fire them for cause without benefits. It is an interesting thought.

You can’t revoke a teachers license for refusing to accept the pay package, but you can accept their non-acceptance or resignation and replace them with teacher who will accept the pay. It isn’t legal to engage in political activities on the taxpayers’ dime/time. Every one of them could be fired for cause at this point. You know who else liked to cut pensions? Oh wait liberals said we couldn’t make that joke anymore. Gosh, was it only last week that I predicted that the fight over pubsec pay would be the most brutal we have seen in a long time? And doesn’t our President have a gift for alienating everyone who isn’t a Party member? To the extent people are aware that he is spending his days trying to gin up mobs in Madison, WI, its bound to hurt him. it’s that awareness thing that’s the problem. I’m trying to imagine Diane Sawyer putting on that phony concerned look as she reports the President is fomenting the fight in Wisconsin. I was just thinking about the dissemination of information regarding this. Wonder how it plays out. By the way, ABC used to be the best of the big three. Now, I get my network news nowhere. I might actually have the urge to go counter protest, or just outright harass in a legal manner, any union protests in MO. Sounds like a good way to spend an afternoon. Looks like a counterprotest is being put together in Madison tomorrow. Instapundit has a link up. I have to admit, my motivation would be more to just piss off people that I can’t stand. The political overtone is just icing. Looks like a counterprotest is being put together in Madison tomorrow. Instapundit has a link up. I wonder if all three libertarians will show? “I wonder if all ‘of Wisconsin’s fed up taxpayers’ will show?” unions make up 12% of the work force, at best… I’ve got my Gadsden flag at the ready and my ear to the ground. I’ll see you at the counter-protest, hmm. I’d be more likely to have a smart ass sign. Or dress as the easterbunny and strike for bunny rights, cause 364 days off is not enough. Hmm wonder what a giant pink bunny costume costs. Please film if you decide to go full Easter bunny and start putting hardboiled eggs in socks and beating people. Like this?  nobody’s grass is safe…  If I lived in WI I’d go. Oh wait — I couldn’t, because I’d actually have to show up to work or be fired. If you lived in Wisconsin, you’d have to be home because the teacher’s unions “sick out” canceled your kid’s school, and you’d have to be at home to supervise them. Win-Win. Think of the unprecedented education advantages, though. Take the kids to the counter protest. They will learn more than if the were in school. Sounds like plenty of those school kids have already been bussed to the union protest by their state-approved parents, the teachers. Words cannot begin to describe the magnitude of hypocrisy and world-class irony of this situation. just think, 13 major metropolitan cities with graduation rates less than 50%… these protesters must “ring” when they walk… In California, the kids would be better off if the teachers went on strike.

Tony you have any Idea what someone puts at risk to start a business? Do you have a clue the 80% of all new business fail in the first 5 years? Lastly Tony the average Millionaire fails at least 4 times and losses everything before they finally figure out what was keeping them from success in the first place. Would you like know what their problem was the first 3 times? It was hiring idiots like you who couldn’t earn their worth and their unwillingness to fire such fools! Next time when you get a check Tony look and see the name of the person that signs it then go and kiss their ass! My money it’s some securtary of state and it’s a welfare check! So start kissing my ass because thats who’s paying you and I would at this time like to fire your ass! Awesome response, Darth. Asking liberal tards if they ever got a job from a poor person is great. There is no response to that. Make them answer it too. Refuse to keep talking to them until they answer that question yes or no. Yes my political philosophy supports ensuring that working people have a decent standard of living. We’re talking government employees here, Tony. There’s nothing ‘working’ about em. And a decent standard of living includes six figure salaries, gold plated pensions and free insurance? How many teachers do you know make six figures? You have a caricature of public servants in your head. On the whole public servants do more for society than most workers and get paid less than they deserve. And they’ve been under assault from Republican policies for decades. I just want you guys to spend five minutes talking about the real leaches in this society, the wealthy and corporate elite. You act as if they couldn’t possibly be influencing policy to enrich themselves. Only the poor and downtrodden are capable of that! On the whole public servants do more for society than most workers and get paid less than they deserve. You truly are shameless, you gutless little turd. Tony. I live in a community of 20,000. We have more than 100 teachers who are making more than 90,000 for 9 month’s work. They do not pay for their health insurance. They signed a contract two years ago that promised them 3.5% annual salary increases over 3 years. That’s no caricature my friend. So Tony, you believe it is somehow just to force, for example, parochial school teachers who are already paid less than public school teachers, to pay for the public school teachers’ zero-contribution retirement pensions while also having to contribute to their own 401k out of their paycheck? All the governor of WI is saying is that public sector employees should have no exceptional benefits over the private sector, which is being very austere these days. Even with this legislation, the public employee benefits package will still be better than and require them to contribute less than the private sector averages. Maybe that’s why the public has very little sympathy for their whining and sense of entitlement. How many more decades of teacher’s union-driven public education policy failure will it take to convince you that they have done little but exacerbate the cycles of poverty in this country. How can spending jump exponentially even adjusted for inflation with not only no performance improvement, but actual regression over the past few decades? You should be ashamed if you think that’s progressive — or anything other than tragic. Re: Tony, How many teachers do you know make six figures? You mean with benefits or without? You have a caricature of public servants in your head. There’s no need for that. They are pretty much a bunch of living caricatures themselves. On the whole public servants do more for society than most workers and get paid less than they deserve. That’s a grotesque lie. Taking someone else’s money by force and then pretending to give back some service nobody asked for is NOT doing “more for society.” And they’ve been under assault from Republican policies for decades. Only if that were true, but the size of government just keeps growing – so you’re basically lying again. I just want you guys to spend five minutes talking about the real leaches in this society, the wealthy and corporate elite. Why would they be leeches? I *know* public officials are leeches because they take money that does not belong to them, BY DEFINITION. But you better explain why the so-called “wealthy” are leeches. I’m one of those public servants. I don’t need you speaking for me, Tony. I can speak for myself. Same here. Actually feel fortunate that scientists where i work are NOT union. The city’s geeks are, and actually fare worse … at least the competent ones. The incompetent are extremely lucky to have civil service protection. There are teachers making 60K, 80K and over a 100K and plenty of adminstrators with 6-figure pensions you fucking provincial twit. Are you a paid shill? “On the whole public servants do more for society than most workers and get paid less than they deserve” The Dems are in big, big trouble if this is what they’re selling in 2012. “You have a caricature of public servants in your head. On the whole public servants do more for society than most workers and get paid less than they deserve. And they’ve been under assault from Republican policies for decades.” BS. I live in a state with an area of a state with a modest cost of living and marginally more sane policy on public sector compensation than nutcase states like NY or California. My neighbor has been a grade school teacher for 15 or 16 years, has a master’s in education, and makes around 60 k. She skips out of work about 40 or 50 days per year and recently played sick for a couple of months so that she could get reassigned to a different school mid-year. By all realistic metrics, she is massively overpaid and should have been fired long ago. But she’s safe, because of a little thing that makes it next to impossible to can her butt: TENURE. Its quite a nice racket if you’re in the privileged class. “I just want you guys to spend five minutes talking about the real leaches in this society, the wealthy and corporate elite” You couldn’t be further from the truth. My father was an entrepreneur. He put in insane hours at the office, doing his own little bit trying to make the world a better place. Growing up, my family life really sucked. In return, my father’s company went public and he became very wealthy. It provided him a minor degree of recompense for the health problems, strained relationships with me and my siblings, and other issues. He became wealthy BECAUSE he, his company, and his employees were so incredibly productive. But, but, but – he didn’t EARN money, he MADE it! Waahhhh! It’s not FAIR!!! I know 0 teachers who make 6 figures. I do know a dozen who are making 90k though, where SAT’s are roughly 500 in each category, where professors make less. It’s real, and it’s not uncommon at all. You are just a complete idiot. I have seen your beloved “public servants” in action and they are nothing more than lazy overpaid underworked who couldn’t cut it in the private sector. I know four teachers that make six figures. I live near Pittsburgh. We pay our teachers quite well around here. We all know Tony doesn’t work. Hell he even likes to kill babies. Man, I wish I could paid over summer months for doing next to zilch work. That’s what I feel I deserve. LOL (I don’t know how/what WI teachers are paid over summer, but I know they are in other states) “supports making sure wealthy people have a better standard of living than they already do, even if it means using government coercion to steal from the real contributors to this society.” MWTF!!?!?!? THIS is  enough for everyone on here to ignore you or insult you. Comments like this give you away. You are either A) Trolling or B) So mentally challenged, that even the most basic of concepts slips your grasp! It’s interesting what gets you guys worked up. As in challenging the axiom you hold that wealth=productivity=virtue. You would have me believe that only the poor and working class are capable of influencing government to enrich themselves, and that the rich aren’t. What kind of sense does that make? Why are they still poor if they’re so powerful? Tool… I mean Tony, no one has ever said anything remotely close to that. We have lamented countless times how the corporatists have used government to drive out competition and give themselves bigger and fatter pay checks. They get to bi-pass rules and regulations that the little folk are forced to abide by. Tony had been fully indoctrinated by the Obama regime. Besides, he likes to kill babies and global warming is his religion. Tony|2.18.11 @ 11:40AM|# Yes my political philosophy supports ensuring that working people have a decent standard of living. Yes, because telling people that they can’t work for the market rate for their skills due to price-setting minimum wage laws, thus making them unemployed, results in a “decent standard of living” for them. We’ve had full employment in this country with minimum wage laws in place, and we’ve had 10% unemployment too. Seems like they have nothing to do with unemployment. The current employment picture has nothing to do with minimum wage laws, but with a deep recession caused by the financial sector’s recklessness. “Seems like they have nothing to do with unemployment.” Just because you do not perceive the effect, does not mean it is absent. Minimum wage laws distort the labor market. —“the real-world consequences favor Republicans and their nihilistic corporate thievery campaign.”— Nihilists! Fuck me. I mean, say what you like about the tenets of National Socialism, Dude, at least it’s an ethos. Ve are Nihilists! We beleive in nozink! Ve will fuck you up Lebowski! Dear Dear Tony, As one of the ‘working people’ those of your political philosophy claim to support, I’d like to tell you right now to take your ‘righteous working-class’ philosophy and shove it up your fucking ass. Thanks to ridiculous taxation levels, heaps of insane regulations that ensure the top-level businesses are the only ones with market share, and ridiculous wage and cost of living distortions, the ability to start a small business in the hopes of getting out of a blue-collar, shit-paying job no longer exists. Seriously, fuck you. -Working Man Don’t forget devaluation of the dollar……. To Tony, making public employees contribute more towards their own pension and healthcare benefits is “using government coercion to steal from the real contributors to this society.” Riiiiight. Why do we always see the term “working people” when we are talking about those wanting the biggest handout from those of us that actually work and pay our own bills? When ever I hear that code phrase, I know that someone is putting their hand into my pocket. working people = social justice Yes my political philosophy supports ensuring that working people have a decent standard of living. And if their work is not worth that standard? . Yours, on the other hands, supports making sure wealthy people have a better standard of living than they already do, even if it means using government coercion to steal from the real contributors to this society. Which coercion is that? Tony|2.18.11 @ 11:33AM|# “The ones your entire political philosophy is designed to enrich. People who vote for and fund the campaigns of Republicans.” Poisoning the Well:  You should read that if you expect to be taken as other than an ignorant asshole. Comically misusing names of logical fallacies is OM’s job. I’m not poisoning the well. I’m saying explicitly that libertarianism is consciously designed as the philosophical lipstick on the pig of Republican corporatism. ..and you’d be wrong. It’s just a coincidence that you believe all the same things with respect to economic policy? Tony|2.18.11 @ 11:41AM|# “It’s just a coincidence that you believe all the same things with respect to economic policy?” Uh, this is a site promoting libertarianism. Exactly how dumb are you? Uh, this is a site promoting libertarianism. Which, I’m arguing, is little more than corporatist, plutocratic, Republican apologetics. What’s most baffling to me is the fact that it is totally possible to be an intellectually and morally fulfilled liberal who doesn’t spend his days licking the boots of the wealthy elite. But you choose not to on “principle.” There are better principles out there! Go suck a diseased cock, Tony. Right, because Republicans, like libertarians believe that workplaces should be able to hire whomever they want regardless of visa status since they support a free market for labor. Also, like libertarians they support the end to the military-industrial complex, no more subsidization and favoritism for corporations through targeted tax breaks, and free markets for all activities that don’t violate peoples’ rights. We’re like exactly the same… Same goes for far-Left progressives and the Democrats. That’s why they all supported propping up megabanks and Wall Street with TARP. It’s officially Ingenuous Day for Tony. Well done. Falls on deaf ears, but still. Why are you bringing morality into this, Tony? The whole issue is that Tony grew up in a wealthy family and he feels guilty. In addition, he hates his parents and thus loves hating the wealthy. it is totally possible to be an intellectually and morally fulfilled liberal who doesn’t spend his days licking the boots of the wealthy elite. Fuck you, loser. Explain why your hopey changey asshole put the same people in charge of the financial sector that have rigged the system for years. Your time’s coming to an end. People won’t pay for your bullshit anymore. Go fuck yourself. “It’s just a coincidence that you believe all the same things with respect to economic policy?” No, republicans don’t. They’re close to democrats though. Come on Tony, you’re being disingenuous. You know damn good and well by now that we don’t support corporatism any more than socialism or communism. Republicans don’t think the government should get out of all business, just the businesses they like. Tony|2.18.11 @ 11:37AM|# “I’m not poisoning the well.” I see you still haven’t read the assignment. Speaking of logical fallacies Tony, labeling libertarians as Republicans so you can argue against Republicans while claiming to be arguing against libertarians is textbook straw man. It is not a strawman when my very argument is that libertarians are Republicans who hate Jesus. Are you or are you not siding with the Republicans on this issue? What is a Republican except someone who believes in Republican policies? I’m a libertarian, and I don’t believe in the legal concept of corporations. I also loathe Republicans. Therefore your statement is falsified. I know I’m late to the party, but I love Jesus and am not a republican. “Are you or are you not siding with the Republicans on this issue? What is a Republican except someone who believes in Republican policies?” Your first question refers to a single issue, your second refers to multiple policies. Your implication is that siding with Republicans on a single issue means one believes in all of their policies. That implication fails basic logic, and an argument based upon a faulty premise is by definition a fallacy. At least you’re consistent in your complete and total disregard for logic. sarcasmic, I don’t think so, because there is absolutely no  to side with Republicans on this issue unless you’re just a Republican shill. This is a political fight. There is plenty of rhetoric about fiscal policy, but that’s all it is. It’s really about Republicans trying to take down the vestiges of their political opposition in public sector unions. And you guys are twisting yourselves in knots agreeing with their every move, whether it has anything to do with freedom or not. “I don’t think so, because there is absolutely no  to side with Republicans on this issue unless you’re just a Republican shill.” You are saying that I must either support the unions or oppose them for political s, when in fact there is another option which is to oppose public sector unions as a matter of principle. That is a textbook example of the fallacy known as Excluding the Middle, also know as False Dichotomy, Faulty Dilemma, and Bifurcation. Did you graduate from the College of Fallacious Arguments? “there is absolutely no  to side with Republicans on this issue unless you’re just a Republican shill” What an asshole. No ? If you say so, Butch. Tony, My theory is that in college you thought you were majoring in Fallatio when you signed up for Fallacy. He’s Born-Again Barack. You have blind faith in him and everything he does. “It is not a strawman..” and pouts as he stamps his little foot. Sorry, it’s just the visual I get from the way you argue. incif is failing on this thread, so I see this shit, dont know why Im replying: my very argument is that libertarians are Republicans who hate Jesus Im a born again christian. I just disproved your argument. Go fuck off. Given the context — that Tony is always here — this is one of the most disingenuous arguments I’ve ever heard. Tony is baiting you. Anyone who spends two days at  knows the difference between R’s and libertarians. Tony, you should really go away unless you need this attention. Oh, and a lot of us have advanced degrees. And even though we all do it, you misspelled “leeches,” without the possibility of a typo. Not smart, seeing as how you’ve been trying to play the smart card recently. Tony, you used to be hall-of-fame troll material. Now you’re getting soft. I for one am disappointed. He’s like the Nick Cage of trolls — he’s prolific enough that he can’t really help but have a lot of crap along with the gems. I would prefer the Nick Cave of trolls @Lord Humungus — first real laugh of this whole thread. I think I love you. (in a manly, y’know… bromance sort of way.) Ouch, Tony, too much truth there. Here’s the fundmental disconnect, in a nutshell. Our philosophy in no way enriches any designated person. It merely gets the State out of the way of those who desire and can obtain riches through voluntary, mutual agreement. It’s the left’s philosophy that uses coercion to distribute and enrich, Tony. Now, THIS is the real Tony. Missed you. Those pretenders just don’t make me laugh like you do. Fuck you, Tony. Engage in arguments, tell us why we are wrong, that is all fine. But don’t presume to know my motivations. Is it really that hard to understand that some people actually believe that government shouldn’t favor any group or any particular outcome? You may claim to believe th est pal. You REALLY think that the rich lawyer politicians are going to clean out their country club buddies? No, if the public sector unions win it isn’t the rich who will suffer. Yes the rich are a small proportion of the population. That in itself is the problem. We can’t fund government just by taxing them, because there aren’t enough of them. Without getting into a pointless discussion about what’s “fair,” the brass tacks is that the top 1% have 70% of the nation’s wealth. Once some of that is distributed downward, there will be more people with more money, and hence more of a tax base. This is really the only solution to fiscal problems. Squeezing more out of the 99% who share 30% of the wealth won’t do it. In fact it is counterproductive. Jesus H. Christ on a stick with cheese fritters. Really, it’s the only solution. “Without getting into a pointless discussion about what’s “fair,” the brass tacks is that the top 1% have 70% of the nation’s wealth.” So……………………… what? So do you think that’s the case because the top 1% started working so much harder, and the bottom 99% started being lazier? That can’t be the case, since productivity was rising the entire time wages were sinking for most people. So the point is there is absolutely nothing “fair” or “freedom-filled” or “not government coerced” about that wealth distribution. But you’re going to go on defending it (and proposing it get even worse) anyway. I don’t care why the case exists… I do care when morons like you try to rectify what you think is wrong by infringing upon others. It’s weird how you guys go from being utopian idealists to stalwart defenders of the status quo, depending on whether it’s the poor or rich benefiting from it. Yeah! Let Tony pick the winners. He’s better than any of your silly ‘markets’. I don’t know who the fuck “you guys” are, but I learned a long time ago saying that makes you look like an idiot. About the same time I learned that I can’t fly and sticking pennies in my nose was a bad idea. “depending on whether it’s the poor or rich benefiting from it.” We understand that allowing someone to keep what they earn (aka tax cut) is quite a different thing than taking one person’s earnings and giving them to another person. You really don’t understand how giving people stuff that was taken by force from other people is different from letting people keep stuff that is already theirs? You really don’t understand how giving people stuff that was taken by force from other people is different from letting people keep stuff that is already theirs? I understand that this formulation begs the question. You are entitled to exactly what money you have after taxes. If it’s taken in taxes, it is not yours anymore, it is the national treasury’s. Um in order to take the object of the taking must have belonged to someone regardless of how or why the object is taken. Your foot has to have more holes… So Tony, if this argument is true, you have just accidentally justified the government taking 95% of every minimum wage slave’s salary, since that money is “the government’s” and not “the worker’s”. The workers have no right to that money, therefore the government would be able to grant that money to whomever they choose, which would likely be the politically connected elite, since they, under your ing, owe nothing to the people they took the money from. But you’re trolling so I don’t believe you have any philosophical ing skills or self-awareness. I don’t follow. The only  they are entitled to minimum wage instead of third-world rates is because government requires it. You have the right to whatever money you acquire by legitimate means, minus taxes. The “minus taxes” part IS my point. That tax money is YOUR money. Otherwise, the government can set a 95% tax rate and say that’s not “your money”, it’s the government’s — and you have no rights to it. If you can pay for government in a way that’s not stealing (for example, corporate value taxes, which pay for artificial legal protections those entities claim from government), there’s no justification for stealing the productive fruits of individual labor, no matter how rich or poor the victim is. Hobo – There is nothing that says the government cannot enact a 100% income tax and then divvy it out as they see fit. Well, nothing except that some of us (excluding Tony) would rise up and overthrow the government. How do you intend to perform this magical redistribution? How will that create more wealth? Remember, the dollars in the hands of the “rich” (I use quotes because I don’t know how you define the term) aren’t enough–simply sticking the dollar into someone else’s hand doesn’t make it grow. It sounds as if you think wealth is created simply by seizing it from someone who has “too much” and giving to someone “more deserving”. How much do you think this will increase the nation’s wealth, and how do you know it will be enough? Change tax policy so that it’s more progressive. Bolster the safety net. Make rules for the financial sector so that reckless gambling with the nation’s money is discouraged, and actual productivity is encouraged (after all, the only  the financial sector exists is to support the economy–if all it’s doing is making money for the top 1% and causing huge recessions, why is it there?) The more people with disposable income, the more money goes into the economy, and the more taxes are collected. Rich people simply don’t spend as much of their money as the middle class does. That’s just an obvious reality. It has nothing to do with who’s more deserving, but I guarantee you someone who makes 30K worked harder for every cent than someone who makes $30 million. Change tax policy so that it’s more progressive Because the fact that the top 10% of earners already pay 70% of the taxes is not progressive enough? Fuck off, slaver. Thats because they have almost all of the money! Wrong again – the top 20% have about 50% of the wealth, yet pay 70% of the taxes, so they already pay taxes disproportionately large relative to their wealth. The bottom 50% pay 2.7% of the taxes, and 47% pay no federal income taxes at all – not surprisingly, these are the people voting themselves more goodies at the public’s expense. Oops – the top 20% actually pays about 80% of the taxes. If value was based on how hard one works, you might have a point. But I can work my ass off digging holes and filling them in again and it is still not worth anything to anyone. So you disagree with how they do taxes in Europe? Since our tax system is far more progressive in nature. Once some of that is distributed downward, there will be more people with more money, and hence more of a tax base. Just as an aside, I find you to be a curious “benefactor” to the working class. It sounds as if you just want to fatten them up for the slaughter. the top 1% have 70% of the nation’s wealth. Citation? *chirp* *chirp* *chirp* Without getting into a pointless discussion about what’s “fair,” the brass tacks is that the top 1% have 70% of the nation’s wealth. Surprise! Tony lied. and people died Except the top ten percent pay 75% of the taxes right fucking now Tony. wealth=productivity=virtue wealth=productivity=virtue wealth=productivity=virtue wealth=productivity=virtue wealth=productivity=virtue wealth=productivity=virtue wealth=productivity=virtue wealth=productivity=virtue wealth=productivity=virtue wealth=productivity=virtue not spam wealth=productivity=virtue I think you’re conflating Objectivism with Libertarianism Baaah! Please, don’t fuck sheep here. Don’t knock it ’till ya try it. And libertarianism with libertinism. The President should not have his own groups of astroturf brown shirts busing around the country intimidating individuals and local governments. It’s vulgar, and its totalitarian. But this is the only thing this President knows how to do. He’s a joke; he’s destroying this country and creating a foreign policy mess so massive it may prove catastrophic. I think the next administration should enact policy which prevents future presidents from such blatant power abuse. What’s that you say? The Constitution already contains such provisions? But that’s too ‘oldey-timey’ for lefties to take seriously; let’s give them something modern. The Constitution already contains such provisions? Who knows…it was written in Sanskrit over a hundred years ago…no one knows what it says today. But this is the only thing this President knows how to do. He’s a joke; he’s destroying this country and creating a foreign policy mess so massive it may prove catastrophic. It is pretty remarkable indeed; he’s only been in office for two years, and now it seems like virtually the entire world is on fire and in danger of burning to the ground. I knew exactly what this creep was all about well before America made the mistake of electing him, but I honestly never thought that the disastrous repercussions of his election would be felt so quickly. Custodian is to janitor what community organizer is to . . .? Public nuisance? Rabble rouser? Dirty hippie protester? Collective bargaining only works when government coerces employers to bargain with collective bargainers EXCLUSIVELY. This is called “racketeering”. Under any other circumstance, employers can tell collective bargainers to go fuck themselves. I brought this down here because it’s important. Please name the policies that exist that make collective bargaining a coerced activity. Union membership is voluntary. Yes, there are laws that prevent employers from harassing or interfering with workers’ right to collectively bargain, or to fire them for being in a union. (The right to collectively bargain being recognized internationally in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.) So what? There are also laws that prevent employers from hiring children or paying people below a minimum standard or sexually harassing their employees. When you get down to it, what matters is not principles of freedom. It’s a balance of power between employers and employees. Places where collective bargaining rights are robust have higher-paid workers with better working conditions. Is it possible for power to tilt to far in their direction? Theoretically yes, but that’s not been the way it’s been in this country for a very long time. Not that the anti-union rhetoric has changed at all. Article 4: No one shall be held in slavery or servitude; slavery and the slave trade shall be prohibited in all their forms Funny, I feel like I’m slaving for a gov’t that is working for the public employee unions. Article 20. * (1) Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association. * (2) No one may be compelled to belong to an association. Number 2 is of interest Well, you don’t HAVE to work there, you know… Re: Tony, I brought this down here because it’s important. Please name the policies that exist that make collective bargaining a coerced activity. Union membership is voluntary. The Wagner act being a never mind to you, I fancy… And the coercive part is in making employers bargain with unions exclusively, by government fiat. When you get down to it, what matters is not principles of freedom. It’s a balance of power between employers and employees. You’re begging the question. Places where collective bargaining rights are robust have higher-paid workers with better working conditions. Wow, shit, that’s some consolation when the company folds due to higher cost of labor – “I am a proud unionized ex-employee.” Yes, there are laws that prevent employers from harassing or interfering with workers’ right to collectively bargain, or to fire them for being in a union. (The right to collectively bargain being recognized internationally in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.) So what? I though you said there was no coercion involved, not two paragraphs ago. It’s only coercion when it stops things Tony likes. Union membership is not voluntary in any industry they have their tentacles in. Not if you actually want to get a job. Tony, you’re really pretty shockingly ignorant of what the law says. The Wagner Act says that if employees form a union, employers are obligated to negotiate with that union and a contract can be imposed upon the employer by an arbitrator if the employer refuses to negotiate. That’s coercive. It also says that only one union can exist for a given unit of employees. So if I don’t like the union I’m in, and try to get other employees together to form a DIFFERENT union for the same plant, I’m barred from doing so BY LAW. That’s coercive. Antitrust law also allows workers to join together to blackball an employer [that’s all a strike is, ultimately] but makes it a crime for employers to join together to blackball a worker. That’s coercive. Extending an associational right to workers and denying it to employers also is a blatant violation of the principle of equal protection. Not that the left gives a shit about equal protection when the party being denied equal protection is “da rich”. It also amuses me that you post a DEMAND for examples of ways in which the law is coercive – but then list several examples, only to discard them by admitting you don’t give a shit. Why are you disputing the law is coercive, when you already had your own examples? Why didn’t you cut out the middleman and just admit you don’t give a shit if the law is coercive or not? No, like Fluffy said, it’s coerced under the Wagner Act, which was a Congressional policy decision to end labor strife and productivity stoppages by forcing employers to collectively bargain with an official bargaining unit. You’re just wrong. Tony — dipshit to the rescue! Obama supported TARP. TARP was a wealth transfer from the taxpayers to Big Banker. Tony supported Obama. Therefore, Tony has no one else to blame for the fat cat plutocrats living the good life while ‘teachers suffer’ more than himself. Pretty fucked up what you are doing to those teachers, man.

Oh no, that would contradict your article of faith that they are all worthless parasites, and confirming your preconceived biases is more important than having good government. Re: Tony, I find it the case that people who are underpaid are easier to bribe. Yet you said a few posts above: “In fact many public servants forgo a much higher salary in the private sector in order to contribute to their society. EEEEEVIL!” So which one is it, Tony? Are they underpaid and thus bribable, or are they selfless public servants? They can’t be both. Should we not want the best and the brightest in government? You really believe the best and brightest are in government? Holy shit, that’s stupid. God no, we shouldn’t want the best and brightest in government. We want them out in the Productive Sector, where their bestness and brightness will make a positive difference. You mean where they’re working for the sole purpose of increasing one firm’s bottom line. There is an ever-present irony when libertarians spew their market worshipping government hating bullshit on the Internet. It’s not ironic at all. The state had imposed a monopoly in communications services for the first century of the existence of the telephone.

By the way, I’m actually intrigued by how the Wis. Governor is putting this collective bargaining thing together. I’ve been advocating for years that public sector unions- if allowed to exist at all- should have their contracts come before the people as a public thumbs-up or thumbs-down vote. That way, the Unions’ true employers have a direct say in their compensation package. The problem as it exists now is that if the public sector goes on strike, they’re not striking against the government, they’re striking against me. So shouldn’t I have a more direct hand in their negotiations? They’ll argue that we elect people to represent our interests and make those decisions. Great, then I’ll pile up my uncollected garbage (which pays a median salary of $71,000 a year) on the lawn of my elected official. You know, since I elected him to represent my interests… “The problem as it exists now is that if the public sector goes on strike, they’re not striking against the government, they’re striking against me. So shouldn’t I have a more direct hand in their negotiations?” “third-party” problem. Yes, and the  it’s screwed is that a third-party (the government) negotiates in your behalf. Similarly, Obamacare is going to cost and arm and a leg, rather than save them. We live in a constitutional republic and we appoint representatives to, among other things, negotiate contracts for state services. We can throw out those reps every so often. I recommend we do. Since we can, contract periods should not run beyond the term of the sitting legislature. The incoming legislature can renew or change terms as it sees fit. yes, but we have bicameral legislatures, and they are often staggered or have different terms? (2 years for reps and 4-6 for senators). So, which do we go by? In NH, every state level elected official, including governor, legislators and executive council are up for election every 2 years. Really makes “throw the bums out” years interesting. SERIOUS QUESTION: why is it so controversial to require a citizen to be a net tax payer in order to vote? That would make it difficult to vote yourself a bigger welfare state, no? “SERIOUS QUESTION: why is it so controversial to require a citizen to be a net tax payer in order to vote?” And I think the slogan can be: “No representation without taxation!” That would make it difficult to vote yourself a bigger welfare state, no? I think you provided your own answer. There is merit in the principle, agreed. Time to kick up the voting age to 21. Youngsters who don’t know their behinds from holes in the ground have no business voting themselves more bennies like reduced colleg loan costs. Those receiving more unearned or over-compensated handouts than they pay in should not be able to vote. And there should be an accounting by SSN for every penny received by an individual. If they do ever come out ahead, then they can start to pay it back. What is with you people and your assumption that the rich can’t vote themselves welfare ( favorable policies)? Elitist fuck. The right to have a say in your government comes from the fact that you are governed by it. You are literally arguing to bring back slavery, to have people with means determing policy for those without against their will. If you don’t like the policies that come from democracy, then convince others to change their minds, dont argue for dienfranchisement of those who would disagree with you. You see, this is the answer I was looking for. I wasn’t asking how one would go about it. I was genuinely asking why it is taboo to broach the subject. Spoof, poofter or not, you provided an excellent response. Re: Tony, What is with you people and your assumption that the rich can’t vote themselves welfare (favorable policies)? Talk about missing the point. The right to have a say in your government comes from the fact that you are governed by it. Circular thinking: “Vote for government you are governed by your vote for government you are governed by your vote….” So, you would be willing to put your civil liberties t the vote? Don’t want to be an elitist you should accept the fact that the state can determine what you do in your bed room if the voting public allows them to do so. What about my post suggests I favor a strict majority vote on civil liberties? But if the people don’t have journeys control over the policies that affect themselves, who does? Journeys = ultimate. Stupid iPhone autocorrect. “But if the people don’t have [ultimate] control over the policies that affect themselves, who does?” Uh, folks who got elected in gerry-mandered districts by brain-deads like you? The same folks who can’t be bothered to read the Constitution? In a more libertarian friendly system, I think that that would be a able policy. But as things are, government is too involved in too many aspects of everyone’s lives. I think that means that everyone needs to have a little bit of a say in who runs things. I do however think that only property tax payers should be able to vote in local budgeting votes/town meetings. Forward to the future! The 18th century! Tony|2.18.11 @ 5:43PM|# “Forward to the future! The 18th century!” Uh, tony your ignorant support of choo choos is different thread. To Tony, like all “progressives,” progress only goes one way.

Tony|2.18.11 @ 1:37PM|# “It’s weird how you guys go from being utopian idealists to stalwart defenders of the status quo,…” It’s weird that you seem to be able to type, but can’t read. Even more humorously, the Left epitomizes this notion far more than libertarians. Defending the status quo (defend public sector workers’ benefits packages even if it makes us insolvent) and utopian idealism (tax the wealthy until everyone has more or less an equal share of the pie and can live in harmony). What a beautiful site! Angry mobs expressing their wrath! Demanding social justice! Oh, Obama, you are a man after my heart! I just hope you can keep your head and strive forward! With the demonstrations in Madison, does anyone wonder anymore why so many are afraid of card check? Vote for us or we’ll come to your house works, but is it America? Re: Tony, As long as you’re not conflating public sector workers with the evil bogeyman “the state.” They’re just people looking out after their own interests, So do thieves. […]and I don’t think there are many private sector workers who do more for their society than teachers. Really? Like farmers, for example? You should be careful about what you write, fool. And you know perfectly well that we have a fundamental disagreement about whether taxation is theft. I know – thieves say it isn’t. I disagree. You’re wrong, but you won’t accept it so there’s no point in you ever bringing that argument up again. There’s no point because you simply construe taxation as something else besides the forceful taking of property, as it would make your view of the state that much tacky. The taxman’s gun at our heads taking more and more and more is NOT just–just rationalized thievery. The mere fact that a guvmint says it thinks it should have more of what you create by your tact of mind and sweat of brow is NOT rightful–no more than was the German guvmint taking Jewish property for all of what they insisted were the “right” s. We do have some obligation, especially for defense, as per the Constitution. But the astoundingly grotesque greed and class envy of the leftists is an abomination (Obamination?). As soon as any man or woman loses 35% to taxes in combination at federal, state, and local level, he or she should not have to pay a penny more in taxes that year. We do have some obligation, especially for defense, as per the Constitution And with this you completely undermine your premise. Either taxation is theft or it isn’t. If you’re ok with it paying for some things then you just have a policy difference, not a fundamental one. Even if your fringe interpretation of what the constitution allows were correct, which it’s not, just because something is written in the constitution doesn’t change the nature of taxation to pay for it. Re: Tony, And with this you completely undermine your premise. Either taxation is theft or it isn’t. It is, by definition: the taking of property under threat of violence. If you’re ok with it paying for some things then you just have a policy difference, not a fundamental one. “Paying” implies a voluntary act. Taxes are NOT voluntary, so whatever I wanted or not is irrelevant. […]just because something is written in the constitution doesn’t change the nature of taxation to pay for it. The Constitution can say the moon is made of green cheese, that does not make the moon green cheese or taxation anything else besides theft. So thanks for confirming once again why it’s completely pointless to debate with you about anything. Even the armed forces are illegitimate. Having a government at all is illegitimate. Yet somehow we’re all supposed to agree on what theft is? And we’re supposed to agree to refrain from it by the honor system? Tony|2.18.11 @ 3:29PM|# “So thanks for confirming once again why it’s completely pointless to debate with you about anything.” Pretty sure you’d have a hard time ‘debating’ a pumpkin. And that is not just low hanging fruit, that’s ground fruit. Re: Tony, So thanks for confirming once again why it’s completely pointless to debate with you about anything. Of course it is, if you keep bringing up red herrings and misconstrued concepts – it WILL be pointless… for you. Even the armed forces are illegitimate. Of course they are, even Constitutionally – the Constitution does not grant power to keep a standing army or air force, only a NAVY. Congress only has the power to raise an army, but that’s it – raising one does not mean KEEPING one. Having a government at all is illegitimate. I haven’t said that! You can have a government, of your own, to pet and play with. Yet somehow we’re all supposed to agree on what theft is? Depends – who’s “all”? Because you and your mommy are not “all.” And we’re supposed to agree to refrain from it by the honor system? Not if you want to – you can alway try to confront my two good friends: Smith, and Wesson. So your preferred society is one which is governed by whoever has the biggest weapon. Lovely. And theft is whatever the person with the biggest weapon says it is. We used to call that barbarism, pre-civilization, the Stone Age, stuff like that. So your preferred society is one which is governed by whoever has the biggest weapon. Lovely You mean like the government? Or are you so stupid you think the government doesn’t operate based on a monopoly of force? Ya that’s the point, it has the authority and also the checks and balances and democratic legitimacy. Om wants everyone to be a government unto himself. Tony|2.18.11 @ 7:49PM|# “Ya that’s the point, it has the authority and also the checks and balances and democratic legitimacy.” So, yeah, WTF, that’s what Tony “thinks”. With irrelevant asides tossed in. Ya that’s the point, it has the authority and also the checks and balances and  ference for the fascists. It’s simply amazing. You would allow the courts to crush a powerless individual that had a contract with a corporation (because you believe in free market fairies and the “sanctity of contract”) yet when an immensely powerful corporation that is protected by the government doesn’t get all the terms they want in a contract you fascist goons attack those with less power with relish. You are mindless hypocrites that simply hate the working class. Here’s hoping you get a fucking steel toed boot up the ass you fascist boot lickers. Preach baby Preach. The public is fed up. Here in Michigan our new Gov just laid out a ton of proposals. Has the lib’s over at the freepress all up in arms.. as the days past the freepress writers find themselves alone asking where’s the outrage LOL. The people are done listening to the we have to have more crowd. I’ve been screaming it since I was 10 that was 35 years ago. I believe the rest of America is finally catching up and I’m loving it. Dem’s and their union thug buddies are imploding on the capitol steps in Madison and them appear to be completely oblivious to it. The thing that is most telling to me is that so much of the emphasis seems to be on teachers, when it is cops and firefighters who are guilty of almost all the pension-spiking gimmickry, and are most likely to be honestly overpaid. But since these groups are more divided at the polls, Republicans give them a free pass. LIBERAL unions, however, are held to a different standard. I almost think the Wisconsin bill could be considered a Bill of Attainder, in that it exempts for no logical  groups that endorsed the governer’s campaign. It seems specifically designed to attack his political opponents, and therefore could be considred unconstitutional. Bill of Attainder, probably not… But I agree that cops & firefighters are just as bad and/or worse in a lot of cases. Also, those groups have powerful abilities to use emotional appeal. “If you don’t give us a raise, your house will burn down and we won’t be able to stop it!” Regardless… The teachers here aren’t exactly in the poorhouse and they’re just being asked to contribute more to their own pensions – something other teachers across the country already do (I think my mom contributes about 15%). “If you don’t give us a raise, your house will burn down and we won’t be able to stop it!” Even more, there’s some speculation that houses will burn because of a lack of raises. Yeah, those huge endorsements. I mean, 4 out of 314 endorsed Walker. Those are staggering numbers and indicate a clear bias on Walker’s part. EXCELLENT ARTICLE ON o. HE IS REALLY SCARY. CAN YOU RECALL ANY OTHER PRESIDENT- TAKING SIDES AND ATTACKING ANOTHER GOVENOR…. Chad I think it has more to do with work related death and risk issues.. as well cops ain’t paid so well you might want to look into it teachers are way better off in pay and benefits. Exempting cops means admitting that unions bestow some benefit. Again this is a political attack it’s not about principles or saving the budget. Wisconsin doesn’t even have a big budget crisis and I fail to see how taking away collective bargaining has anything to do with that anyway. Tony|2.19.11 @ 1:19PM|# “Exempting cops means admitting that unions bestow some benefit.” Tony, ask for a refund on your straw grasper; it’s broken.

NO. Tony dun shat all over this thread. I’m impressed at his body of work today. You deserve a day or several thousand off. Scrap the entire school system, fire everyone and start over. Destroy the damm Unions. For the sake of argument let’s agree that the forerunners of AFL-CIO were the ones who stopped coal-mine owners in West Virginia from working a 7 year old boy to death. Even if it was the “union” that saved the children from slave labor then, how can that be compared to the “union” now trying to save an ineffective schoolteacher a 5% cut in her 50k/yearly salary? I don’t believe there can be any comparison. I suppose there must be exceptions but generally speaking today’s union worker doesn’t seem to be much of a worker at all. P.S. Cops, firemen, nurses and schoolteachers should not need an AFL-CIO “union” to help them do their job. You’re absolutely right–there’s no comparison. Furthermore, if recent history has taught us anything, it’s that the unions won’t make any meaningful concessions until they’ve reduced everything around them to smoldering embers. Just look at Detroit. Public employee unions are more entrenched in our governments than the UAW was in Detroit–and if you want to see how bad things have to get before the unions will make any substantial concessions, just look at what they did to Detroit. I’m getting the feeling Tony is a union teacher, or government union member or employee. Nope, unlike libertarians I don’t base my policy beliefs on myopic shirt- term selfishness.

I read Krugman and Reich on a regular basis, and steaming piles of shit doesn’t begin to describe those two, or their special pleading. I’m interested about what parts you found shittiest. Characters, plot, the hamfisted lecturing. I’m also starting to think he has a liberal arts education and has never bothered to educate himself beyond that in the areas he’s choosing to discuss. At least MNG and Tulpa understand the arguments and both sides, they just disagree for varying s. I’m starting to think that, even if Tony is employed in the private sector, the company that he works for has some serious government contracts. No need. Computers are now cheap; janitors can afford them and no manager cares about a janitor’s political views. Plus, a janitor can finish the rounds early and spend time proving his/her ignorance on the web. Please. Janitorial work takes attention to detail, and an ability to actually produce results. There’s no way Tony’s a janitor. Upper management. Maybe daddy’s company. “Please. Janitorial work takes attention to detail, and an ability to actually produce results. There’s no way Tony’s a janitor.” I stand corrected, and apologies to those who do good janitorial work. Seriously, that was unfair on my part. Good work by anyone is good work. And I’m sorry to have compared anyone who does so with Tony. It’s odd watching the non-finance talking heads this morning. The Democrats seem to be implying that the WI Governor is ramming legislation down the someone’s (I assume the voters) throats. Not a one of them has been challenged on the ramming and tap dancing done to get the healthcare bill passed by the Democratic party. We need to make professional politician a capital offense after 5 years of being one. Fire the truant teachers! Obama is scum. I’d like apologies from all the  staffers who voted for the fucker. David Weigel?! Who else voted for Obama? Who else voted for Obama? Ron Bailey i think. Be he had a pretty good excuse. ‘The Republicans needed to be punished’ Hard to argue with. here is the list: Peter Bagge: Barr; Obama if close Ronald Bailey: Obama Radley Balko: Barr Drew Carey: “Anybody but McCain/Palin” Tim Cavanaugh: Obama Shikha Dalmia: Nobody Brian Doherty: Never votes Nick Gillespie: Barr, if he votes Katherine Mangu-Ward: Never votes Michael Moynihan: Won’t vote Charles Oliver: Won’t vote Bob Poole: McCain Damon Root: Probably nobody, maybe Barr Jacob Sullum: Barr Jesse Walker: Barr David Weigel: Obama Matt Welch: Probably Barr Cathy Young: Probably Barr Tim also voted for Obama.  I don’t know what’s weirder, seeing the votes for Obama–or seeing only one vote for McCain. It’s hard to believe that was only a couple of years ago. Obama-lama ding dong sucks so bad, McCain couldn’t have been much worse. And you’re going to have to reach to claim Biden is ‘better’ than Palin. McCain couldn’t have been much worse.

OhioOrrin|2.19.11 @ 4:00PM|# “what about the rest of america?” Doctrinaire dems, assorted brain-deads voted *for* Obama; no suprise. Seems the rest (like the  staffers) voted *against* McCain.

I started an Epic Thread list  Feel free to add others you know about. THE “TONY TELLS THE TRUTH” GAME!!! the game at which if Tony were intellectually honest his own beliefs destroys his whole argument. “So Tony should US soldiers be able to unionize?” “No, that would be awful. In time of war they just walk off the job in protest. Our military is a primary service of our nation.” “Well what about Teachers and Police and firemen.” “No they are not primary service” “If they are not a primary service then why don’t we farm those jobs to the private sector” “No we can’t trust the private sector to police our streets and teach our children. Corporations would be a corrupting influence.” “So only government can do that work” “Yes” “So it is a primary service that only the government can do” “….well yes it is” “So how can we have primary government services exposed to Union strikes. If police can walk off the job during a crime spree or if teachers leave work for months at a time on fake sick leave then our country is at risk. Just like if the military went on strike.” “My god you are right.” “No I am not right. I don’t believe nearly anything I said. I only told you what you believe and showed how it completely conflicts with itself” “Wow you really are not a Republican or a Democrat….it is almost as if you hold different values and a different political philosophy then either of those two wings.” “yup” If you think he’d actually come to that conclusion, I don’t think you really “get” how Tony works. Once you thoroughly defeat him with his own words he simply ignores you. It happens time and time again in this thread and every thread he’s been on. For a perfect example, Vermont Gun Owner’s comment on 2.18.11 @ 1:23PM. That’s why he’s the epitome of a troll and why arguing with him is generally waste of time, unless you’re testing your own patience skills to practice for a counseling job with the mentally handicapped. Goes like this, where X= Tony, Da Troof, OrinOhio, SM, etc. 1) X makes ridiculous claim. 2) X’s claim gets busted with data/links, etc. 3) X posts: ‘those are wrong!’ 4) X gets more evidence slammed in X’s face. 5) X posts ‘I’m morally superior to you!’ After which, I get tired of it and post ‘You’re a lying asshole.’ Maybe soldiers should unionize. It’s not like we are facing an imminent threat of invasion, and even with their flag-waving chest pounding, Republicans seem fine with cutting soldier and vet benefits. Whatever their issues, public sector unions are simply the last vestiges of a once strong advocacy for a middle class in this country.

The middle class has been decimated by government regulations and favoritism, along with the diversion of legitimate infrastructure and operational funds into the pockets of the non-terminate-able pubsec unions and their political cronies. This is just a ponzi scheme. The government will be cut. Then and only then will the ‘middle class’ revive itself. But when it’s left-wing delegitimization of right wing protests in action it’s ok, because those protestors are all radical, unhinged militant billionaires and their paid shills, and not taxpayers honestly concerned about injustice and impending bankruptcy. Right Tony? Actualy, the appropriate thing for him to do is sit down and shut the fuck up. This is a state fucking matter.

Fuck you crony-capitalist parasite. You live in a fantasy world that if the working class was destroyed Jamie Dimon and the other capitalist parasites would wave the magic wand and all the disaffected retards (aka right-wing libertarians) would be magically lifted up as they were under the socialistic practices of the mid 1900s. You fools side with the fascists and guess what? They aren’t on your side. You’re attacking your fellows in a race to the bottom. You are the fucking parasites you Ayn Rand fools. And who bases their whole philosophy off of one author? Go lick another fascist boot you scum sucker. Jesus you are stupid. Jamie Dimon isn’t paying for state employee salaries, working people are. And they’re being asked to take on an ever growing burden just so this “protected class” won’t have to pay into their own retirement and healthcare. Sorry, but that’s crap, and it has to stop. Libertarians – republicans without the direct support for homophobia or empire building. Proud union thug–“MY THIRD-TIER CLERK’S JOB IS THE LYNCHPIN HOLDING OUR SOCIETY TOGETHER!!” Some realtalk here: “Too often, your average branch or division of state government is packed with unskilled hausfraus and other losers who owe their positions with great benefits, pay and zero responsiblity or standards to their backslapping buddies. The end result is dealing with lazy employees more interested in watching funny online videos and reading magazines at their desks who can’t even take a phone message correctly after years of office “work,” and powertrip on the unfortunate civilians they’re supposed to serve. Plus they bristle with hostility at any co-workers who might actually be competent at their jobs.” Can any libertarian explain to me why the government should decide for unions whether they have a right to use collective bargaining or not? Isn’t that… *Fascism*? Oh wait, I forgot, you guys see public employees as subhumans, and you thoroughly approve of using democratic *force* to subjugate them. Taxation even via democracy is theft, forcing public unions to disintegrate via democracy (and faked fiscal problems that busting unions won’t solve) is not fascism. Why do you libertarians insist you are free-thinkers who abjure both parties equally? You weigh republican to the degree where you even abandon your own philosophy just to side with them against the hated Obama. Fucking scum. Can any libertarian explain to me why the government should decide for unions whether they have a right to use collective bargaining or not? Better yet, we could let the people who pay the salaries of the public sector unions–the taxpayers–decide whether or not they can use collective bargaining. Of course, this works both ways–the teachers can feel free to form a union, and the governor can feel free to fire all of them. Freedom of association doesn’t just work in one direction, you know. Isn’t that… *Fascism*? No, it’s not. Oh wait, I forgot, you guys see public employees as subhumans, and you thoroughly approve of using democratic *force* to subjugate them. Proud union thug, ca. 2009: “ELECTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES YOU DUMB REDNECKS!!!” Proud union thug, ca. 2011: “DON’T USE ELECTORAL RESULTS AS A POLICY BLUDGEON, YOU FASCISTS!” Fucking scum. Feel free to jump in front of one of your beloved high-speed trains, you feudalistic waste of carbon molecules. So the people are the employers, and employers should get to decide whether their employees have rights? I’m sure that will turn out fair. You guys are for almost the least amount of freedom possible, in the name of freedom. The Pols are the employers in this case, they are the ones doing the bargaining. The Pols were generally elected by the unions so the unions were bargaining with themselves. The people decided they didn’t like those pols, now we can bargain the way we want. Collective bargaining has never been listed in any list of fundamental rights I have seen. Almost every western country in the world treats it as a right. It’s only the Ayn Randian paradises you fascist parasites have set up around there world where the playing filed has been so dramatically tipped in favor of the crony-capitalist class where workers have no right to organize.

I realize the concept of “freedom of association” is one you don’t fully grasp, Tony, but try to keep up here. Hey, the republicans didn’t get elected in sufficient numbers – so when the dems scarpered to Illinois, that was democracy in effect. If the people of WI had wanted the republicans to be able to force through these kinds of bills, they would have elected more republicans :D. If a democratic governor had conjured up a fiscal surplus and raised taxes on corporations only to be able to butter up unions and permanently increase their power, I would have supported republicans fleeing the state to prevent that from happening? You know why? Because I am not a disgusting retard who is incapable of taking every situation on a case-by-case basis, and I don’t have any preferences towards different power-hungry organizations and collections of people. I fear unions and corporations equally, because again I am not a retard. Why the continued name calling? Libertarians fear both unions and corporations, both of which are corrupt, powerful welfare queens obviously seeking political favors if they get involved in politics at all. Megacorporations use government to regulate away competition, just like the labor unions do. “Libertarians fear both unions and corporations, both of which are corrupt, powerful welfare queens obviously seeking political favors if they get involved in politics at all.” So why are the little scumbags here cheering on Walker, who is giving corporations free money while wanting to hamstring unions? Answer: they are lower citizens than you and MUCH lower citizens than me. You are a decent, honest and nuanced person – you most certainly do not represent the maggots populating most of this site. a.) Does “free money” mean cutting corporate income taxes, which are regressive taxes that are simply passed down to consumers like hidden sales taxes via inflated prices? b.) If he is giving certain corporations favors and subsidies, libertarians would absolutely oppose him on those and still support him on attempting to bring public sector pay in line with private sector equivalents. They’re two separate actions – just like we can support Obama’s willingness to cut Defense department spending and criticize his excessive domestic policy spending. These salary, pension and benefits costs make up the biggest part of state budgets (especially compared to corporate welfare), so perhaps the latter is why you hear us disproportionately supporting him. If you’re unwilling to renegotiate the public sector status quo, I’d like to know what you think the solution is to solving the fiscal crisis it these Midwest states. Illinois is doubling their corporate taxes and corporations and their jobs are now leaving the state as quickly as possible. Raising taxes puts more of a burden on an already austere private sector and individual families. Also, why bother to claim you fear unions and corporations equally, when your moniker is “Proud Union Thug”? “Can any libertarian explain to me why the government should decide for unions whether they have a right to use collective bargaining or not? Isn’t that… *Fascism*?” When a group of workers collectively says “we’re not coming into work until you give us what we want”, either the employer has the option of saying “no” or the employer is forced by law to say “yes.” The former is called a free market and the latter is called socialism. Since America is not the Soviet Union, government workers can certainly ask for a billion dollars a year each, and taxpayers (their employers) can tell them to go take a collective hike. Teachers can likewise quit en masse right now and the government couldn’t stop them. Raises, pensions and benefits for public employees negotiated years in advance remove the budgetary power of the legislature and democratic oversight by taxpayers. Workers in a free society always have the right to negotiate because they have ownership of their own labor, but they don’t have the right to get everything they want. Typical right-wing fantasy. It’s not even logical. You have to resort to throwing words around, like “socialism”, that you have no idea what they mean. Corporations (entities that were severely limited by government in the first 100 years or so of our Republic) have all the power in our society. This is Fox News style propaganda. Workers have not gotten everything they want. Corporations nearly have, though. And such hyperbole! They ask for a billion dollars a year? It used to be every worker got a pension and health care. But those poor and defenseless corporations must have gotten lucky when they were able to push labor around so that labor is weaker now than probably any other time the last 100 years or so. And you right-wing terrorists attack working people as you lick the boots of the fascists. Go back to watching your stories on Faux News. Go fill your little doughy head with images of worthless black people getting free money from you Masters of the Universe with their fancy union contracts. God. I hate you fucking people. Lickspittle servants of the fascist elite. Wow. Guess I touched a nerve there. Try again. I’m a left-winger – just not a state socialist or Keynesian. I don’t even believe in the artificial legal concept of corporations. Business owners should be fully and personally liable for the violation of rights and not be able to pass those costs on to society. That is neither here nor there since we are talking about PUBLIC sector unions, which FDR himself vigorously opposed for the exact same ing I laid out above. Workers have the right to bargain en masse by withholding their labor, because they alone have dominion over that labor. The employer has the right to fire them all, meet their demands or work out a compromise. This is the only voluntary arrangement possible. Legal interference involves either coercion against the employer’s dominion over the voluntary distribution of their capital (socialism) or against the worker’s dominion over the control of their own labor (fascism), neither of which are acceptable to people who believe in natural rights and freedom. Oh by the way…speaking of hyperbole…yeah… Walter Wit Man|2.21.11 @ 1:33PM|# “…It used to be every worker got a pension and health care….” Until it bankrupted the companies. Typical brain-dead lies. God. I hate you fucking people. Lickspittle servants of the fascist elite. Ahh, another prison bitch of the managerial class speaks. Every class gets its right to pursue its interests and status in society whatever world has developed.The key lies in how government to deal with this problem, or in other words balancing even better such condition which ensures protesters go back home and that then get jobs or at least should not worry about tomorrow’s dinner.. This essay exposes the intellectual and moral bankruptcy of the right-wing libertarianism. They have bought into the right-wing Republican fantasies that unions and working people have undue influence on our economy and government. In reality, it is the elite capitalists that have undue influence and have captured our government to funnel the wealth of the productive class to their parasitic hands. Right wing libertarians are the regime goons that engage in lies to obscure who they really work for–the rich. What about the sanctity of contract? You fucking fanatical hypocrites want to enforce contracts when it benefits the largest oligarchical immoral parasites (the corporate class) but when those with less power, the working class, have a few contracts left that benefit them, you jackals attack. Fuck off and die you terrorist fuckwads. Obviously you are misinformed and know only what the media tells you about libertarianism. We agree with you that the powerful elite and corporations are welfare queens and should be cut off completely. We also believe that’s a function of big government, which protects their donors (large enterprise) and regulates away the smaller fish who can’t compete or are blocked entry in the first place. Why do you think Goldman Sachs backed Obama’s financial regulatory bill? Also the moral hazard caused by detaching personal responsibility from profit via the government-created legal status of the corporate entity results in abuse of workers, environmental degradation and bad/fraudulent business practices. We believe in the sanctity of contract, which requires both sides are able to enter voluntarily. If the taxpayers elect officials to say that we will only agree to negotiate pay but not benefits with the unions, the union can either accept this, attempt to renegotiate or lose the contract altogether. They can determine whether they will strike or not, knowing that there are potential consequences for doing so. They"

""We have to smack their hand a little to get it out of the cookie jar,"" state Sen. Stacey Campfield told  today after confirming that he and state state Rep. Matthew Hill have launched Tennessee's version of a national nullification bill.

There, it would direct ""the general assembly to appoint a committee to review all federal laws and regulations for constitutionality"" and require the committee to submit for a vote of the general assembly all federal laws and regulations ""it deems to be invalid under the Tennessee or federal constitutions."" The plan has been promoted by The Patriots Union, a Wyoming-based organization that is taking in hand the battle against what it considers an overreaching federal government. Campfield said it's not that the federal government has gone ""a little too far."" ""It's gone way too far in what their responsibilities are,"" he said. ""Probably half of what the federal government is trying to stick their nose into.""

The key, however, analysts have said, is what will happen when the first actual confrontation comes between the federal government and a state exercising its constitutional rights. RELATED: Voters to Congress: We're not buying it Campfield said, ""I would like to think that the state would prevail. … It comes down to who has the final say."" He said he's talked with a number of Tennessee sheriffs who say they are ready, willing and able to take on that argument.

""I would like to think there's enough spine this year,"" he said. Attorney Stephen Pidgeon, a spokesman for the Patriots Union, said states are starting to assert their rights under the Constitution. He said the idea is as old as the administration of Jimmy Carter, because at that time it was called the ""Sagebrush Rebellion"" when Western states fought back against Washington's control of land inside their borders, especially oil-rich and coal-filled land resources. Advertisement - story continues below ""There is no constitutional right for the federal government to hold natural resources, federal parks,"" he said. ""For states such as Utah, which has been fighting with the federal government to regain ownership of its own lands, [this nullification plan] offers a strong argument to chase the government off its property."" The issue is being forced into the headlines by Barack Obama's decision that effectively would nationalize the decision-making process for health care across the U.S., under Obamacare. But states also have raised the issue of currency, the REAL ID Act, marijuana laws, guns, health care regulation and others. ""Under the Constitution states are required to use coinage of gold and silver,"" Pidgeon said. ""But the federal government has inflicted on the states the fraud of a debased fiat currency.

""The federal government is bankrupt,"" he said, making it for states a matter of survival. ""This is no longer a policy issue. It's not 'shall we have salt or pepper.' The question is 'shall we eat or not.'"" Advertisement - story continues below Officials with the Patriots Union say dozens of states are working on the idea of a nullification plan. Major components of the proposal are: The legislative proposal is a huge leap beyond what already has developed among the states whose officials are telling Washington to back off on individual issues ranging from state marijuana laws, National Guard control, and the imposition of Obamacare, the nationalized health care program.

She told  her proposed legislation has options for states to describe the size and composition – or even designation – of their commissions. But the focus is the rights of the states which, according to the U.S. Constitution, includes everything not specifically assigned to the federal government. ""This is not anything new,"" she told . ""We just reiterated the power that the states have always had."" But she said over the past 70 or 80 years, the ""federal government has been encroaching on the [rights and responsibilities] of the states.""

They have a compact with the federal government. The federal government was established to serve at the pleasure of the states."" In Arizona, the ""USPU Nullification Act"" was introduced as SB 1433 by Sen. Lori Klein, and it's being support by several cosponsors already. It first was introduced in Montana, where House Bill 382 is sponsored by Rep. D. Skees. Advertisement - story continues below ""If passed, the bill reasserts the states' right to nullify any federal statute, executive order or judicial intrusion which the state legislature deems unconstitutional and abusive toward the states or the people of the states,"" the Patriots Union explained. The project was helped along by the work of Stand Up America, the organization run by Maj. Gen. Paul Vallely. According the Patriots Union, ""The sovereign states lost congressional representation of states' interests in 1913 with the passage of the 17th Amendment, which removed the constitutional right of each state legislature to choose two representatives of state interests, to be seated in the U.S. Senate. ""Since then, all branches of the federal government have increasingly acted against the best interests of the states and the people, reaching farther and farther beyond the scope and authority granted them in the U.S. Constitution and today, the federal government functions with utter disdain for both states' and individual rights."" Advertisement - story continues below The explanation continued, ""With no legitimate venue available in which to demand redress of grievances in the legislative, executive or judicial branches of the federal government at present, we have determined that the people of each state, via their elected stated officials, must take broad but specific state measures to force the federal government to live within the confines of the U.S. Constitution and the enumerated powers."" Prohibits 'infringement' of rights In Montana, the proposal is ""an act prohibiting infringement of the state of Montana's constitutional right to nullification of any federal statute, mandate or executive order considered unconstitutional.""

"by Brett Stevens on February 23, 2011 When we speak of passive aggression, we’re talking about a general term for all actions that hide their aggressive intent behind egalitarian guilt. For example, during your dinner hour, a traveling salesman bangs insistently on your door. You tell him you’re not interested, and he gets indignant. “But I drove all this way, and I’m lugging these heavy carpet samples,” he says. “I have every bit as much a right to earn a living as you do.” Now he’s got you: you must either state a belief in inequality or a disregard for his suffering. A good salesperson knows that getting the foot in the door is the point of no return. If she makes you hesitate for just a few seconds, that’s tacit permission to continue with the spiel. And at this point, you’re using up that salesperson’s time and since they’re equal, guilt is expected. Passive aggression strikes when someone uses that guilt at inequality to make you receptive to their message, and then to make your changing the situation seem like an inconvenience or attack directed at them. You can see this in our politics and interpersonal behavior: Our society — which doesn’t lead, but polls us to see what is popular, profitable and inoffensive — forms a paradise for both salesmen (consumerism) and socialists (parasites). In both cases, people irrelevant to your life want something from you. Whether that is your time, your allegiance, your money or just your eyes, they’re taking something from you — your irreplaceable moments. That quiet dinner you were enjoying? Not for you; they have needs, you know. Your house? Your business? Your family? Not yours; theirs. Understanding passive aggression helps us understand one great mystery of the modern time: how normal people get caught up in destructive waves, usually by not daring to oppose the passive-aggressives who manipulated them: Communist Russia was comprised of Russians who just wanted to live in peace, yet the Russian Communists were responsible for the murder of about 20 million people. The peaceful majority were irrelevant. Chinaâ€™s huge population was peaceful as well, but Chinese Communists managed to kill a staggering 70 million people. The average Japanese individual prior to World War II was not a war-mongering sadist. Yet, Japan murdered and slaughtered its way across Southeast Asia in an orgy of killing that included the systematic murder of 12 million Chinese civilians – most killed by sword, shovel and bayonet. And who can forget Rwanda, which collapsed into butchery? Could it not be said that the majority of Rwandans were â€œpeace lovingâ€? History lessons are often incredibly simple and blunt; yet, for all our powers of reason, we often miss the most basic and uncomplicated of points. Peace-loving Muslims have been made irrelevant by the fanatics. Peace-loving Muslims have been made irrelevant by their silence. – INN We all get taken for a ride when we don’t stand up to people with insane, incomplete or impractical ideas. Yet in a society where each individual is an island, and any island can be offended and reject oversight by any other, ignorance spreads. Eventually ignorance is united in a movement for The Common Good of one kind or another, and then it’s off to the races. One reason for this is that in a society of people who put their own interests first, being a victim is the only safe role: The article, titled ‘To Escape Blame, Don’t be a Hero – be a Victim’, is published in the March issue of the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology. The findings are based on three experiments conducted by Gray and Daniel Wegner, professor of psychology at Harvard University. ‘Our research suggests that morality is not like some kind of cosmic bank, where you can deposit good deeds and use them to offset future misdeeds,’ said Gray, who directs the Mind Perception and Morality Lab at the University of Maryland. Gray suggests that the explanation for these findings is our tendency to divide the world up into moral agents – those who do good and evil – and moral patients – those who receive good or evil. ‘People ignore heroic pasts – or even count them against you – when assigning blame’ ‘Psychologically, the perceived distance between a hero and a villain is quite small, whereas there’s a wide gap between a villain and a victim. – Daily Mail The problem is that without people who are in charge, and keeping others in line through heroic and often unpopular actions, society rages out of control. It starts to follow what people want to be true, instead of what they know to be true or can estimate is more likely to be true. Inconvenient questions get ignored in favor of a gold rush toward what is popular and thus, rewarding. A new study reveals how ecosystems crumble without the presence of top predators be keeping populations of key species from growing too large. It also provides a cautionary lesson to humans, who often remove top predators from the food chain, setting off an eventual collapse. … The top predators play their role by happily munching away at each channel’s top consumers, explained study leader Neil Rooney of the University of Guelph in Canada. “Top predators are kind of like the regulators of the food webâ€”they keep each energy channel in check,” Rooney told LiveScience. “The top predator goes back and forth between the channels like a game of Whac-a-Mole,” a popular arcade game in which constantly appearing Constant predation of the top consumers prevents a population from growing larger than the system can support. – MSN We can see this kind of passive aggressive behavior in the news quite a bit of late. Generally, it takes the form of individuals putting their interests before all other concerns (individualism) and then justifying their behavior with appeal to an external, socially-recognized good like “equality” or “fighting global warming.” Beyond politics, our tolerance for passive aggression threatens our ability to have a functional society. By concentrating power in the individual, and making the individual judge and jury as perceiver, we have created an inherently divisive society where we can undermine each other with catty social demands. As we face an uncertain future, we will have to make hard choices. Choice A or Choice B, but not both, and not half of each since doing either one halfway would mean nothing got done. In this time, we’re going to see passive aggression finally put to the practicality test, something we’ve avoided with four centuries of industrial wealth and easy living.

"Follow Us National Review Sanders Rebukes Manchin’s Downsized Ceiling for Reconciliation Bill This Day in Liberal Judicial Activism—September 12 The Supreme Court in the American Constitutional Order The Myth of the Red Pill The Billionaires’ Party The protesting public-school teachers with fake doctor’s notes swarming the capitol building in Madison, Wis., insist that Gov. Scott Walker is hell-bent on “union busting.” Walker denies that his effort to reform public-sector unions in Wisconsin is anything more than an honest attempt at balancing the state’s books. I hope the protesters are right. Public unions have been a 50-year mistake. A crucial distinction has been lost in the debate over Walker’s proposals: Government unions are not the same thing as private-sector unions. Traditional, private-sector unions were born out of an often-bloody adversarial relationship between labor and management. It’s been said that during World War I, U.S. soldiers had better odds of surviving on the front lines than miners did in West Virginia coal mines. Mine disasters were frequent; hazardous conditions were the norm. In 1907, the Monongah mine explosion claimed the lives of 362 West Virginia miners. Day-to-day life often resembled serfdom, with management controlling vast swaths of the miners’ lives. Before unionization and many New Deal–era reforms, Washington had little power to reform conditions by legislation. Government unions have no such narrative on their side. Do you recall the Great DMV Cave-in of 1959? How about the travails of second-grade teachers recounted in Upton Sinclair’s famous schoolhouse sequel to The Jungle? No? Don’t feel bad, because no such horror stories exist. Government workers were making good salaries in 1962 when President Kennedy lifted, by executive order (so much for democracy), the federal ban on government unions. Civil-service regulations and similar laws had guaranteed good working conditions for generations. The argument for public unionization wasn’t moral, economic, or intellectual. It was rankly political. Traditional organized labor, the backbone of the Democratic party, was beginning to lose ground. As Daniel DiSalvo wrote in “The Trouble with Public Sector Unions,” in the fall issue of National Affairs, JFK saw how in states such as New York and Wisconsin, where public unions were already in place, local liberal pols benefited politically and financially. He took the idea national. The plan worked perfectly — too perfectly. Public-union membership skyrocketed, and government-union support for the party of government skyrocketed with it. From 1989 to 2004, AFSCME — the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees — gave nearly $40 million to candidates in federal elections, with 98.5 percent going to Democrats, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Why would local government unions give so much in federal elections? Because government workers have an inherent interest in boosting the amount of federal tax dollars their local governments get. Put simply, people in the government business support the party of government. Which is why, as the Manhattan Institute’s Steven Malanga has been chronicling for years, public unions are the country’s foremost advocates for increased taxes at all levels of government. And this gets to the real insidiousness of government unions. Wisconsin labor officials fairly note that they’ve acceded to many of their governor’s specific demands — that workers contribute to their pensions and health-care costs, for example. But they don’t want to lose the right to collective bargaining. But that is exactly what they need to lose. Private-sector unions fight with management over an equitable distribution of profits. Government unions negotiate with friendly politicians over taxpayer money, putting the public interest at odds with union interests, and, as we’ve seen in states such as California and Wisconsin, exploding the cost of government. California’s pension costs soared 2,000 percent in a decade thanks to the unions. The labor-politician negotiations can’t be fair when the unions can put so much money into campaign spending. Victor Gotbaum, a leader in the New York City chapter of AFSCME, summed up the problem in 1975 when he boasted, “We have the ability, in a sense, to elect our own boss.” This is why FDR believed that “the process of collective bargaining, as usually understood, cannot be transplanted into the public service,” and why even George Meany, the first head of the AFL-CIO, held that it was “impossible to bargain collectively with the government.” As it turns out, it’s not impossible; it’s just terribly unwise. It creates a dysfunctional system where for some, growing government becomes its own reward. You can find evidence of this dysfunction everywhere. The Cato Institute’s Michael Tanner notes that federal education spending has risen by 188 percent in real terms since 1970, but we’ve seen no significant improvement in test scores. The unions and the protesters in Wisconsin see Walker’s reforms as a potential death knell for government unions. My response?

"© 1998-2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All Rights Reserved Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) has been ranked as one of the most conservative senators, a surprising development for a politician who touted his independent reputation.McCain tied for first place along with seven other Republican senators in the National Journal's ranking of the 10 most conservative senators.Notably, his average rank between 2000 and 2007 was the 44th most conservative member of the Senate, according to National Journal, which compiles an annual ranking based on senators' voting records.McCain tacked right in recent votes as he faced a tough primary challenge in the 2010 election cycle. But he wasn't the only senator who became more conservative in his votes -- a change that could be a reflection of the growing influence of the Tea Party movement.Sens. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Saxby Chambilss (R-Ga.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas) all jumped from being in the top 20 to tying McCain for first place.Also tied for first: Sens. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Jim DeMint (R-S.C.), Jim Risch (R-Idaho) and John Thune (R-S.D.). Below them are Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) in ninth place and Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) in 10th.Notably, among this year's list, four of the senators have either been linked to or shown a strong interest in running for president (or have outright run for president in the case of McCain). Earlier this week, Thune announced that he would not make a 2012 presidential bid; DeMint and Cornyn have also been subject to speculation on the subject.In the House, there was a five-way tie for the most conservative representative this year: Trent Franks (R-Ariz.), Sam Johnson (R-Texas), Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), Doug Lamborn (R-Colo.), and Randy Neugebauer (R-Texas) were all tied for first. Four members of the Ohio delegation made the top 10 list in the House, more than any other state this year.In general, members of the House were further to the right than in the Senate. The highest score in the Senate was 89.7, while the highest score in the House was 95.See the rankings below:Senate1st. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) — 89.71st. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) — 89.71st.

"Misinformation isn't going away just because it's a new year. Support trusted, factual information with a tax deductible contribution to . More Info The Badger State’s old tourism slogan, ""Escape to Wisconsin,"" is a come-hither aimed largely at the Land of Lincoln. But when the political temperature got too hot in Madison on Feb. 17, 2011, 14 Democratic senators escaped to Illinois and helped put Wisconsin somewhere near the center of the political universe. The absence of the 14 made it impossible for the Senate to get a quorum for a vote on Republican Gov. Scott Walker’s budget-repair bill. The senators said they fled because the bill -- which would strip away most collective bargaining rights from most public employees -- was being rushed to a vote. Two days later, Walker called on them to return, suggesting in a statement that they were being hypocritical. ""These are many of the same senators who, two years ago, rammed through a billion-dollar tax hike in 24 hours with no public input,"" Walker declared. Walker repeated the call for the Senate Democrats to return in his televised ""fireside chat"" on Feb. 22, 2011, about the budget stalemate. And numerous readers have asked us to sort out this piece of the debate. So we will. We asked Walker’s spokesman, Cullen Werwie, to explain the governor’s charge. He said the reference was to a budget-repair bill introduced by Walker’s predecessor, Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, in 2009. The content of Doyle’s and Walker’s repair bills -- which were needed midyear to balance the state budget -- are different, but the scenarios are similar. The Doyle bill was approved by a Democratic-controlled Legislature under a Democratic governor. Conversely, Republican Walker introduced his bill to an Assembly and Senate that are controlled by the GOP. (Ironically, the Wisconsin 14 fled two years to the day after the Doyle bill was introduced.) Walker’s statement has three major points: Who was involved Walker is correct in saying ""many of the same senators"" who retreated to Illinois voted for Doyle’s 2009 budget-repair bill. Indeed, 12 of the 14 did; the only two who didn’t, Tim Cullen of Janesville and Chris Larson of Milwaukee, weren’t elected until November 2010. What the bill involved Was the Doyle bill ""a billion-dollar tax hike""? We found in a previous  Wisconsin item that assessed the bill and how it was adopted that taxes, per se, would only be raised by an estimated $290 million. However, if a new fee on hospital revenue was included -- and news reports often referred to the fee as a tax -- the take would be an estimated $1.2 billion over three years. Doyle and Democrats argued the change was welcomed by hospitals and allowed the hospitals to bring in a greater amount in federal money. But it was real money filling a real hole. So, Walker’s claim of a billion-dollar tax hike is essentially accurate. How it was adopted Was Doyle’s bill ""rammed through"" in ""24 hours with no public input""? Again, Walker is essentially correct. No public hearing was held on Doyle’s bill, which was approved by the Legislature the day after it was introduced. As Walker suggested, the Senate vote was strictly along party lines, with all Democrats voting for the bill and all Republicans voting against it. (In the Assembly, all but two Democrats voted yes and all Republicans voted no.) This is one budget-repair bill debate we can bring swiftly to a close. Accused by Senate Democrats of rushing a vote on his repair bill, Walker fired back with his own charge. He said that two years earlier, many of those senators had rammed through a billion-dollar tax hike contained in a Democratic repair bill -- in 24 hours and without public input. The record is clear. We rate Walker’s statement True. Gov.

"By Scott Conroy - February 28, 2011 Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich is preparing to announce in a matter of days whether he will form an exploratory committee for a presidential campaign. Earlier this month, Gingrich told Fox News that he would decide about a White House run by early March. A Gingrich adviser told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution on Saturday that the former Georgia congressman would announce the formation of an exploratory committee in his home state within ten days, and the Associated Press reported that Gingrich would take ""a formal step"" toward a step toward a presidential run within two weeks. Gingrich has for months been making frequent visits to early voting states, and Republican officials in Iowa said that the former speaker has been second only to former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty in the extent of his behind-the-scenes maneuvering in the first caucus state. During a trip last week to Florida, Gingrich publicly affirmed his support for the current early voting state structure. ""I think it is very important to recognize that Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina hold the first three slots and I think that is the right thing to do because of their size,"" Gingrich said before adding that Florida would have to negotiate with the RNC if it wanted to go fourth. Gingrich aides would not confirm that he was set to announce his candidacy but pointed to his previous comments about the timing of an announcement, which they indicated was still on track. Gingrich appears poised to become the second prospective Republican candidate to announce an exploratory committee after former Godfather's Pizza CEO Herman Cain did so in January. With his long record of government service and reputation for having a vigorous intellect and penchant for finding controversy, Gingrich carries with him perhaps the more obvious strengths and weaknesses of anyone in the prospective field of candidates. Advisors to Gingrich have indicated that the former speaker would direct his campaign strategy to try to attract support from a broad coalition of Republican voters in a prospective field that is likely to be crowded with candidates hailing from various wings of the party. In a Gallup poll of Republicans and Republican leaning independents released last week, Gingrich stood in fourth place among prospective GOP candidates with 9 percent of the vote.

"It would be most unusual if Rowling herself was not influenced by the dominant conception of the world in our day. She is not an intellect of the first magnitude that transcends the age and is for all time.However, an imaginative work allows its author to explore themes which are at variance with his/her considered views. Unless a work is intended to be didactic, it is injudicious to infer a 'world view' from a fictional narrative. Suppose we studied the works of Jane Austen in order to discover her 'philosophy of life'. It's possible to fancy that the uniform attitudes of her characters towards marriage, rank, and money which appear repeatedly in her novels, unmask Jane's 'conservative disposition'. But we have to supplement this speculation based on her fiction with real information from her letters etc., in order to discover that at least she wasn't a political radical. On the other hand, a work of satire, like The Screwtape Letters, is a didactic composition which is written on purpose to reveal the (religious) views of its author. C S Lewis expects the reader to learn lessons from his book without the labour of inference. I'm afraid I don't know anything about Jane Austen specifically; but all the early good authors where I know both their works and their life exhibit a unity between the deep structure of their imaginative work (not the superficial opinions and statements of the many and various characters) and their lives as revealed in biographies and letters.This would apply to someone like Samuel Johnson (who only wrote the one novel - Rasselas; or George Orwell; or recent writers like Saul Bellow, or Alasdair Gray (whom I did a masters thesis on). Or poets like RW Emerson, Whitman, or Robert Frost.Indeed, this applies to almost anyone who was pre-PC - except for the self-conscious modernists, who is this respect as in many others represent a decline. It seems to have been almost a mark of self-respect among serious writers that they should try to retain or regain this deep unity of vision in their lives and works. The greatest novelist in English - in the sense of his huge influence, rather than his writerly quality - was probably Sir Walter Scott. His was a fully integrated personality, I'd say. @dearieme - I agree with both propositions. The world of money and power can't help itself, but to produce an artificial, childish and emotion regulating system. The system has to use and squeeze whatever men has inclination to do. The system has to create steep declines from emotional default positions to services and wares; from default spaces to monetized spaces; and from inability to do anything meaningful work outside organizations in urban environment to work in organizations or in their sphere of power. Negative must be made more negative and ""positive"" more ""positive"". How do you talk to such a system inside the sphere of influence of such a system? Men talk differently e.g. to babies than to grown-ups. Of course, organizations demand official talk in many workplaces, especially in less public higher level background jobs maintaining the organizations and their functions.To my mind's eye our environment looks like the following, just more boring and increasingly more threatening. Because the system has deteriorated (by the work of it's own hands), the soothing feeling can turn to something negative quickly:  was among the first about under twenty serious immigration critics in Finland eleven years ago. Now polls show 17,9% support for True Finns party. It is very close or even with the support of the tree biggest parties. Also a second immigration critic party has been born, Muutos 2011 (Change 2011), this years elections are it's first. Not bad in eleven years. What kind of communication achieved this? Alternation between serious long debates, aggressive shouting matches, intentionally provoking the liberal side, persuasion and humor. It is impossible to cause change in society without moving supporters and opponents position of affective ""anchor"" by involving strong emotions. Change wouldn't and couldn't have happened only with official talk, although it is necessary too.The system and it's helpers attacked us with police investigations and courts, and several people were prosecuted and fined. We accepted this as a given, fought in the courts, turned the show trials into embarassing public shows and paid collectively the fines that were given to our people, unless they wanted to pay the fines themselves. I was threatened too with police investigation and trial, but because of reasons unknown to me, it petered out.***In other words, we have moved in ten years from being a constant target of smears and no conversation with the system's representatives to being interlocutors and participants in public debates and media shows, to being representatives in democratic assemblies and we are less smeared. The expected smears before elections have unintentional self-irony in them, because their makers are so out of touch with reality, and the smears describe the system, not us.Change always requires that intellectuals roll up their sleeves and ""dirty"" their hands in societal interaction. This seems to be true of GRR Martin as well. Now, Game of Thrones does by no means compare to the works of Tolkien´s or Lewis, or even JK Rowling´s, in literary or moral brilliance. But, GRR Martin seems to be a usual celebrity liberal in interviews but his world is anything but liberal. It´s dark and corrupt but not liberal. Even the moral tone of the works is hardly liberal either. @AnteB - The US word and concept of 'liberal' is too narrow to be of much use internationally or in history. Liberalism is merely an aspect of broader Leftism, which itself has anti-Christian roots. My impression is that Game of Thrones is anti-Christian. This doesn't make it a bad work of art, since most of the best works of art (qua 'art') of the post couple of hundred years have been more-or-less anti-Christian (e.g. in English poetry since the evil Byron - first rate in influence, if not literary quality - and the less-evil but almost-equally-misguided and harmful Shelley - who is first rate in quality, if not influence. The problem is that when an artist is a nihilist - the higher the artistic quality, the greater potential for harm: e.g. Nietzsche, James Joyce, Picasso, Stravinsky, Samuel Beckett etc. The great thing about Tolkien (or the Harry Potter saga, or Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell)- is that they have a string tendency to do you good; as well as being of very high artistic quality. I agree. What I meant was that the ethos of GRR Martin works is not in harmony with his publicly stated beliefs, like with JK Rowling. The difference is of course that both the work of GRR Martin and his public persona is nihilistic (and maybe leftist, according to the definition of this blog) but in widely different ways, whereas JK Rowling is leftist as a person while Harry Potter is a Christian work.

"by Marcia “He has erected a multitude of new offices, and sent hither swarms of officers to harass our people, and eat out their substance. He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his assent to their acts of pretended legislation…” These words from the Declaration of Independence were penned in 1776 to describe King George III of England, but they could describe the ruling US authority in 2011. If the accuracy of that observation is questionable, the arrogance of the 111th Congress and a recently released GAO report, (“Opportunities to Reduce Potential Duplication in Government Programs, Save Tax Dollars, and Enhance Revenue”) should dispel doubts. The GAO report identifies “federal programs, agencies, offices, and initiatives, either within departments or government wide, which have duplicative goals or activities” and whose elimination “could potentially save billions of taxpayer dollars annually,” Talk about eating out our substance! The GAO report opens a window on federal inefficiency and waste, but it does more than that. It reveals the extent of federal breaches of the Constitution. The GAO, of course, is not concerned with the constitutionality of the programs it analyzed. As the title of the report indicates, it is the GAO’s job to “save tax dollars and enhance revenue.” In a letter to members of Congress introducing the report, Gene L. Dodaro, Comptroller General of the United States, writes, “financial benefits ranging from the tens of millions to several billion dollars annually may be realized” by addressing “a single issue” delineated in the report. (The report is 345 pages long!) As an example, Dodaro suggests that federal revenue losses could be “reduced by up to $5.7 billion annually by addressing potentially duplicative policies designed to boost domestic ethanol production.” The GAO, of course, does not question the constitutionality of subsidizing ethanol production. Nor does it question subsidies for politically favored businesses, euphemistically called “investments” by the current administration that, like agricultural subsidies, subvert the free market, narrow consumer choices, raise prices and increase the deficit. The GAO does reveal that the Department of Agriculture is a spending swamp that, if drained, would achieve “cost savings of as much as $5 billion annually.” A 2009 CATO report on farm subsidies substantiates GAO’s findings and examines their deleterious effects on the economy. Although policymakers love to discuss the plight of the small farmer, the bulk of federal farm subsidies goes to the largest farms. For example, the largest 10 percent of recipients have received 72 percent of all subsidy payments in recent years. Numerous large corporations and even some wealthy celebrities receive farm subsidies because they are the owners of farmland. It is landowners, not tenant farmers or farm workers, who benefit from subsidies.” In short, federal welfare for farm businesses is costly to taxpayers, distorts the economy. Induces farmers to overproduce, “which pushes down prices and creates political demands for further subsidies. The GAO also analyzed research tax credits. Since 1981, the research tax credit has provided significant subsidies (an estimated $6 billion for fiscal year 2011) to encourage business to invest in research and development. The credit, which has been a temporary provision since its inception, was most recently renewed at the end of 2010 and is scheduled to expire after December 31, 2011… Two factors—the definition of research expenses that qualify for the credit and the credit’s design—are important in targeting the subsidy in a manner that increases the social benefits stimulated per dollar of tax revenue foregone… The bureaucratize translated means that Washington-based technocrats decide what constitutes “social benefits” and what companies, having been judged virtuous, benefit from tax credits. Imagine having a competitor who has Uncle Sam as his partner! While Congress is engaged in efforts to remedy the abuses identified by the GAO, it should not fail to address the fundamental problem: Extensions of federal power that far exceed constitutional limits. Not only has Congress allowed the Executive branch to assume legislative authority, but some members believe “the federal government can do most anything it wants in this country.” In fact, those are the very words uttered by Congressman Pete Stark of California when questioned by a constituent about the constitutionality of the Affordable Health Care Act. The 10th Amendment states: The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people. Or as James Madison wrote in Federalist 45: The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government are few and defined. Those which are to remain to the State governments are numerous and indefinite. Washington has turned the 10th Amendment on its head. It’s now the federal government whose powers are numerous and indefinite and the states’ prerogatives that are few (and shrinking). Reading the Constitution aloud in the House of Representatives in the opening days of the 112th Congress was a nice symbolic gesture. But symbols are supposed to stand for something. Ending programs that can’t pass a 10th Amendment test, (and refusing to authorize new ones) would give the symbolism meaning. It would also reveal which members of Congress meant it when they swore to protect and defend the Constitution. 0 comments Kick things off by filling out the form below.

"by James D. Best Larry Schweikart's What Would The Founders Say is a book we've been waiting anxiously for. The title alone was enough to pique our interest. The best-selling author of A Patriot's History of the United States, doesn't disappoint with his latest effort. A Patriot’s Answer to America’s Most Pressing Problems It is relatively easy for a politician or opinion-maker to get a Founder to put a metaphorical arm around their shoulder by quoting something that Founder once said that seems to be in agreement with an advocated position. The unscrupulous can even take a quote out of context, or project a minority opinion and claim it was universal. Many, including this blog, try to project the Founders’ thinking onto modern problems, but in truth, almost any opinion can find a substantiating quote by one of the Founders. Larry Schweikart has done Americans a huge service in writing What Would The Founders Say? He has consolidated the opinions of multiple Founders about perennial issues that range from religion to gun control. Reading this book, you will discover that the Founders not only varied in their opinions, they sometimes changed their minds after debate and reflection. Schweikart is the co-author of the New York Times #1 bestseller, A Patriot’s History of the United States. He writes in a straightforward style that makes the material easy to understand. Unlike many historians, he does not use esoteric or antiquated words to impress colleagues. He is also unafraid of using the period as punctuation. (Many historians have so many caveats and qualifications to any statement that their sentences run on like a legal brief.) He has broken his book into ten chapters, each dedicated to a specific issue with extensive quotes from numerous Founders. When the Founders disagreed, he presents their differences and the rationale for their respective positions. Schweikart references state statutes, state constitutions, philosophers that influenced the Founders, and personal letters, as well as the national founding documents and related writings. All of the Founders’ words are presented as they related to the events of their time. Only in the concluding paragraphs of each chapter does Schweikart try to project their opinions onto current events. Whether the reader agrees or disagrees with Schweikart’s conclusions, he or she will come away with a good grasp of what our forefathers thought about the issues they faced in founding a great republic. Although Schweikart acknowledges that the Founders did not agree on everything, he writes, “Remarkably, there was almost no disagreement among the Founders—even among such polar opposites as Hamilton and Jefferson—that freedom was good and tyranny was bad. That seems an obvious statement on the surface, yet modern Americans daily are confronted by policies enacted by local, state, and federal representatives who see freedom as a threat and greater government control as desirable.” By the end of What Would The Founders Say?, the reader comes to feel he knows the Founders better than current politicians. The Founders spoke more forthrightly, did not abandon their principals, and always felt a responsibility toward their fellow citizens and posterity. Perhaps we should use this same yardstick to find modern politicians that can get us out of our current mess. At least, we should consider the Founders thinking on the issues we face today. Schweikart concludes his book by writing, “Many paid a heavy price for their courage. At the very least, we owe them the courtesy of a virtual consultation about every policy. They earned that much.” James D. Best is the author of Tempest at Dawn, a novel about the 1787 Constitutional Convention. Related posts: 9 comments A good review. Looks like an important book to read and know. [Reply] I’ve heard it said that, “the only true freedom is freedom from illusion.” Perhaps the purpose of this book is to lift that cloud, even if only a little. [Reply] I saw the book this weekend and immediately thought of you guys. I had the book in my hand, but didn’t purchase. It sounds as though I shouldn’t make that mistake again. Thanks!! Regards, Joel [Reply] Martin Reply:March 15th, 2011 at 7:24 am Thanks Joel, Schweikart doesn’t pull any punches. His history is good, and will be a useful reference. [WORDPRESS HASHCASH] The poster sent us ‘0 which is not a hashcash value. [Reply] There are a aspects of this book I liked. However, I found most of the material on Religious Freedom to be fairly inaccurate in terms of the intent of the founding fathers. Although I must say that I think that its fairly clearly that good majority of the Founding Fathers believed in God and that we should be sensitive to that. It is clear though that US Constitution outlaws religious oaths/tests for instance. Yet this not brought up by Larry . These tests were removed over time and as the various State Constitutions were modified in the next couple of decades they actually strengthened the concept of religious freedom. As well, Larry brought up Jefferson as important as a founding father, but then dismissed him as having a significant role in Bill of Rights on this. it was Jefferson’s bill (Virginia Bill of Religious Freedom) that eventually was approved by Virginia (Madison led the fight here) that the Constitution uses as its core logic. The letter & related correspondence to the Danbury Baptist association is critically important here since it shows that the Baptists in Connecticut and Jefferson thought the same on this idea of “the wall between Church & State” Also, North Carolina 1776 has a strong statement for religious freedom/conscience (essentially that you should be able to worship God in any way you want). This came right from John Locke who was adamant about the freedom of religious worship (and Freddowm of Conscience). Additionally he bring up Franklin and doesn’t acknowledge that Franklin’s views evolved over time to be a deist (when you look at the idea of Deism…it don’s seem all that far from being at least non-Christian in your belief about God/Jesus Christ. As well Larry dismisses the idea it appears that Founding Fathers cared about other non Chrisitian Religions. I find that hard to believe. Voltaire as a for instance talked about the various factions or sects out there and singled out the “Mohammadeans” (not sure I got spelling right, but this was his term for The faith of Islam). Madison in Federalist 10 looks to have lifted that idea right out of Voltaire’s writing. No mention is made of Hume and how much Madison relied on him. Yet Hume was an avowed atheist. No mention is made about the Treaty of Tripoli under John Adams, that declares we are not a Christian Nation. All this said, I think we a all have a right to worship God as we see fit, that the Founders intended for us to have an absolute right to Freedom of Conscience and that state taxes and oaths that you were a Christian were to be prohibited. As well, Federal regulations and Court decisions should not impinge our right to worship God (and it seems to me that we ought to be able to do that in public without the state coming down on you for that). Mike [Reply] Mike McManus Reply:September 7th, 2011 at 1:04 pm My apologies for the misspellings above. Also, I should say that I think there is a very good conservative argument to make here. My disappointment with Larry’s approach is that it looks like he made no attempt to argue the counter side. If he had, it would be more historically accurate and he would have added to a substantive debate. However, the book overall is more like a polemic rather than History. That is, Larry asserts certain premises or truths and then justifies those thoughts at times by cherry picking history. On the other hand, if you are a serious conservative (especially Libertarian) then I think you will get some interesting ideas here for further study. I just wouldn’t rely on it as History. I liked one section very much, the section on Education. I can’t remember, but I think a disagreed with some of his conclusions but liked the whole argument he presented. I’m mixed on the book. I guess I would like to see more accurate conservative arguments rather than these polemics that keep coming out that play ‘loose & fast’ with historical facts (and context). I think it does us folks that are serious minded about these topics a big disservice and would like to see more self checking here by authors like Larry. v/r Mike [Reply] I think there are a couple of things we can safely say about the Founders and religion. First, they wanted to deny government the use of religion as a lever in governing people. The world had a history of rulers and kings inappropriately using of religious faith for their own purposes. For example, the “divine right of kings” basically said if you disobeyed your king, you were disobeying an agent of God. The second thing we can safely say is that the Founders wanted the government never to interfere with an individual’s exercise of religious faith. If this is a wall, it seems one-sided to me. Religion is not excluded from government, government is excluded from religion. The Founders insisted on separation of power with checks and balances. This was the greatest separation of power of all. [Reply] I am a high school student and I actually bought this book to help me write a term paper. It was so amazingly helpful and I really enjoyed reading it as well! Highly recommend it! 🙂 [Reply] I haven’t read this one, though I did read Schweikart’s biggest work, the Patriot’s History of the United States. Because of how good that book was, I may get this one also. [Reply] Leave a Comment Name E-mail Website Notify me of follow-up comments via e-mail "
"by Martin Winston Churchill is supposed to have said that history is written by the victors. The implication being that posterity will know the past from the standpoint of the winners and that the losers will get short shrift. That might explain why so little is known about the fate of the Americans who were loyal to the Crown. Liberty's Exiles by Maya Jasanoff fills that void. This new book by Maya Jasanoff provides an interesting look at a topic not hitherto covered here at WWTFT. Liberty’s Exiles: American Loyalists in the Revolutionary World is the result of a prodigious amount of research into not only what became of the British Loyalists, but also the impact of their exodus on the places they emigrated to and on the British Empire in general. Jasanoff follows the path taken by nine main “characters” and numerous minor ones. The characters are used to demonstrate particular trends and provide examples, through the experiences of different migrations, of the situations in which the displaced Britons found themselves. If the book has a primary theme, it is that the loyalist Americans forced to evacuate their homes and find new places to settle, had a philosophical effect as significant in its way as the Spirit of 1776. Jasanoff returns to the significance of “the Spirit of 1783” again and again throughout the book. The date, is of course, marks the signing of the Treaty ending the war, and the subsequent evacuation of Loyalist citizens from New York. Jasanoff defines this Spirit of 1783 as having three main facets: Jasanoff returns to these themes throughout the book and demonstrates them vividly through the biographical details of the people she describes. Her chronicle begins while the war is still raging and she introduces some of her characters in a chapter entitled Civil War. (Today, we think of the American Revolution often as a fait accomplis and think of it as “The American Revolution.” However, had Britain prevailed it would only now be seen as they viewed it then, a civil war.) Most of the characters that Jasanoff focuses on are not people that will be familiar to many Americans. It is the historical connections and relations between these people, and in some cases, with well known American Patriots, that provides one of the interesting aspects of the book. Some in the book aren’t really individuals at all, but whole families. One such family is that of Beverly Robinson’s, a native Virginian who raised a loyal American Regiment. He was the patriarch of the Robinson family, and exemplified the travails and subsequent impact of the displaced loyalists on the British Empire. As it turns out, Beverly Robinson was a friend of John Jay’s. Although Jay hoped for reconciliation with Britain, in the event it was not possible, he was going to make a different choice than Robinson. Hoping to retain their friendship, he pleaded with Robinson’s wife: Picture to your Imagination a City besieged, yourself & Children mixt with contending Armies — Should it be evacuated, where, with whom & in what Manner are you next to fly? Can you think of living under the restless wings of an Army? Should heaven determine that America shall be free, In what country are you prepared to spend the Remainder of your Days & how provide for your Children? These Things it is true may not happen, but don’t forget that they may. Although Jay was correct in his predictions for the Robinsons, never in the book does Jasanoff suggest that the Loyalists picked the wrong side. While many suffered horribly as a result of their choice, from a perspective of principles, the Loyalists were every bit as justified in their opinions as their counter-parts, the people who came to be known as Patriots. After the American Revolution, the evolving liberal constitutional empire of Britain provided a viable and vital alternative to the democratic republics cropping up elsewhere in the world. The Loyalists had a pronounced effect on that evolution. Jasanoff didn’t only choose aristocrats like the Robinsons as her subjects. She also devotes a significant portion of her book to the plight of the Indians who remained loyal to the crown. These fascinating characters include Joseph Brant, his sister Molly, and William Augustus Bowles. Jasanoff also follows the migrations of slaves and erstwhile slaves and explains the role of the different evangelical movements in these communities. After setting the stage in the preliminary chapter, Jasanoff quickly moves on to the evacuation of New York and the logistical nightmare it posed to the British. Almost immediately, the reader is struck by how consistently the British tried to do the right thing. They felt that they were obligated to help the Loyalists, both as a matter of national pride and because it was “the right thing to do.” However, throughout all of the petitions and claims made by the displaced Americans, the British were careful to distinguish between a moral obligation and a legal one. In 1788, Edmund Burke told his colleagues that “the loyalists had no claim upon the House founded in strict right”; but that “the House was bound in honor and justice to take their claims in to consideration.” Taking care of the Loyalists did “the country the highest credit … It was a new and noble instance of national bounty and generosity.” This was critical to the Loyalist Americans who lost the bulk of their property, because the peace treaty that ended the war did little to guarantee remuneration from the United States. Benjamin Franklin, one of the treaty’s negotiators, had a particular ax to grind on this account, because of his relationship with his estranged Loyalist son, William. He was adamant about not having specific provision for righting the wrongs done to Loyalists in regard to their loss of property. To say he was bitter, would be an understatement. The matter of property claims resolution was left in the most general terms for the States to resolve as they would. There was nothing in the treaty to compel them to do so. Many of the Loyalists felt betrayed that their property rights had been dismissed so cavalierly. Ironically, there was one particular “species of portable property,” which enabled some of the colonists to retain a portion of their wealth. This was, of course slaves. The irony of the situation is due to the confused and seemingly inconsistent policies that the British tried to enforce for their subjects. There were many slaves who were promised (and who were ultimately granted) their freedom if they fought for the British. On the other hand, at the time of the peace, Britain was hugely involved in the slave trade. It was big business. Compounding this, in many cases, the portable wealth represented by the slaves, was about the only thing remaining to some Loyalists. The conundrums faced by the British government about how manumitted slaves would be treated and what they were “entitled” to, form a big part of the author’s second point in her thesis on the impact of the Spirit of 1783. On the one hand, the British tried to honor the claims of Americans who’s “property” was stolen. During the war certain plantations had been taken over by the British, and worked, slaves and all, for the benefit of the British army. When the war came to a close, these “sequestered estates” were returned to their owners along with their slaves. Some of the fleeing Loyalists made off with slaves who did not belong to them. John Cruden, one of the book’s main subjects, took his job of chasing down American-owned slaves stolen by departing Loyalists, very seriously. During the war, he had been one of those in charge of running the “sequestered estates.” His zeal in returning, “stolen property” is oddly juxtaposed against the steadfast refusal of the British to renege on their bargain with escaped slaves who agreed to fight. (They did however, make every effort to distinguish between those who pledged their allegiance before the cessation of hostilities and those that attempted to do so afterward. Consequently, many were returned to their “rightful” owners.) The treatment of Loyalists, slaves, and former slaves, in the places they were relocated to, is perhaps no where better exemplified than in the conduct of the Loyalist Claims Commission. The British were able to turn their abject failure to retain the American colonies into a point of pride through their conduct afterward. It also cemented the primacy and paternalistic character of the government. The American Revolution made clear that overseas subjects — even white ones — would not necessarily be considered as extensions of those in the metropolis, in the way that American colonists once hoped to be treated (though that did not stop overseas subjects from seeking enhanced rights and representation). What they got instead was embedded in Burke’s idea of “national bounty,” a phrase that touched on the fundamental ethos of this post-revolutionary empire. British officials self-consciously advertised their moral responsibility toward overseas subjects. It did not matter if you had white skin or black, wore saris or moccasins, kneeled [sic] in a mosque or took Catholic communion: you would still win imperial protection and responsible government. In spite of Britain’s best efforts, many of the displaced Loyalists were poorly served. These people were relocated to Nova Scotia and Halifax in North America, to Florida (and then when Florida was ceded to Spain, directed elsewhere), to Jamaica, the Bahamas, and Britain. Each of these moves repeated many of the same mistakes; delays in granting promised land; unfulfilled promises of exemption from taxation; and problems integrating the different racial constituencies. Jasanoff’s book is filled with interesting people, heart rending disappointments and in some cases, happy endings. There are villains, bigots, insane people, evangelists, and heroes interspersed throughout the book. In the latter category, was John Clarkson, an abolitionist who managed yet another migration of disaffected black Loyalists from British North America to Sierra Leone. Although he was only supposed to facilitate the move by arranging transport and persuading people to dislocate themselves again, the Sierra Leone Company, under whose auspices the venture was formed, appointed him superintendent of the new colony, Freetown. The position was the last thing he wanted. “I had positively declared before I left England, that nothing should induce me to continue in Africa, ” he moaned to the deaf pages of his diary, “or to undertake anything more than collecting the people in America and afterwards seeing them properly conducted to Sierra Leone.” He had been sick and stressed for months, and he longed to sail home to England to recover and rejoin his patiently waiting fiancee. “But what can I do?” When he considered the real “affection & regard” he felt for the loyalists, “and my ardent zeal for the civilization of the surrounding nations, and Africa …. I have made up my mind to take the consequences … and to remain with the poor Nova Scotians till the Colony is established or lost.” He did not have an easy time of it, and was eventually recalled for being too sympathetic to the plight of the colonists. The problems he faced were daunting and difficult and it was impossible to please everyone. But, the Nova Scotians trusted him and allowed him latitude in the time it took to fulfill the promises that were made. Unfortunately, his successors were not so honorable. After Clarkson’s departure, his colony attempted to rebel in protest to the breaking of promises made to them. The rebellion was suppressed, and in an interesting historical aside, Jasanoff notes that among the two dozen rebel leaders banished from Freetown was George Washington’s former slave Harry Washington, who had made his escape from Mount Vernon 20 years earlier. It is, unfortunately, impossible to do this monumental work justice in the space of a review. There is simply too much to cover. For example, toward the end of the book the author sprinkles in some pretty interesting items about the progeny of Benedict Arnold in India. Then there is the tale of William Augustus Bowles, “leader” of the Creek Indians and his exile to Asia, how he ended up in Freetown, Sierra Leone, got back to Florida, and died in a Havana jail. Jasanoff’s book leaves the reader wondering how absorbing the displaced Americans has affected present-day Nova Scotia, Halifax, Jamaica and Britain. Recommendation: Read the book!

As a wave of anti-union bills are introduced across the country following the wake of Wall Street financial crisis, many analysts are picking up on the theory that award-winning journalist and author Naomi Klein first argued in her 2007 bestselling book, The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism. In the book, she reveals how those in power use times of crisis to push through undemocratic and extreme free market economic policies. “The Wisconsin protests are an incredible example of how to resist the shock doctrine,” Klein says. [includes rush transcript] AMY GOODMAN: Rallies for workers’ rights are spreading across the country. In Michigan, over a thousand people rallied at the State Capitol in Lansing to oppose a measure allowing the breaking of labor contracts by placing schools and districts under emergency management. In a scene reminiscent of Wisconsin, hundreds of demonstrators packed the Capitol Rotunda chanting slogans. Protests were also held against anti-union bills Tuesday in Indiana, Ohio, Iowa, Florida and Tennessee. Meanwhile, in Idaho, the state legislature has given final approval to a measure restricting the collective bargaining of public school teachers. The bill would limit teachers’ collective bargaining to salaries and benefits. It also ends teacher tenure, limits teacher contracts to one year, and removes seniority as a factor in determining layoffs. As a wave of anti-union bills are introduced across the country in the wake of the Great Recession, many analysts are picking up on the theory that award-winning journalist and author Naomi Klein first argued in her bestselling book The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism. In it, she reveals how those in power use times of crisis to push through undemocratic, radical, free market economic policies. Nobel Prize-winning economist, New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, recently referenced the book in his column called “Shock Doctrine, U.S.A.” He wrote, quote, “The story of the privatization-obsessed Coalition Provisional Authority [in Iraq] was the centerpiece of Naomi Klein’s best-selling book 'The Shock Doctrine,' which argued that it was part of a broader pattern. From Chile in the 1970s onward, she suggested, right-wing ideologues have exploited crises to push through an agenda that has nothing to do with resolving those crises, and everything to do with imposing their vision of a harsher, more unequal, less democratic society. “Which brings us to Wisconsin 2011, where the shock doctrine is on full display,” Krugman wrote. Well, Naomi Klein joins us today in our studio for the hour. In addition to The Shock Doctrine, she’s the author of two previous books: No Logo: Taking Aim at Brand Bullies and Fences and Windows: Dispatches from the Front Lines of the Globalization Debate. She’s currently writing a new book which focuses on the public relations campaign distorting climate change facts. Naomi Klein, welcome to Democracy Now! NAOMI KLEIN: Hi, Amy. Great to see you. AMY GOODMAN: It’s great to have you with us. Let’s talk Wisconsin. What do you see is happening in this uprising? NAOMI KLEIN: Well, first of all, it’s such an incredible example of how to resist the shock doctrine. And it should not be in any way surprising that we are seeing right-wing ideologues across the country using economic crisis as a pretext to really wage a kind of a final battle in a 50-year war against trade unions, where we’ve seen membership in trade unions drop precipitously. And public sector unions are the last labor stronghold, and they’re going after it. And these governors did not run elections promising to do these radical actions, but they are using the pretext of crisis to do things that they couldn’t get elected promising to do. And, you know, that’s the core argument of and the thesis of the book, is not that there’s something wrong with responding to a crisis decisively. Crises demand decisive responses. The issue is this backhanded attempt to use a crisis to centralize power, to subvert democracy, to avoid public debate, to say, “We have no time for democracy. It’s just too messy. It doesn’t matter what you want. We have no choice. We just have to ram it through.” And we’re seeing this in 16 states. I mean, it’s impossible to keep track of it. It’s happening on such a huge scale. Teachers’ unions are getting the worst of it. Yesterday was International Women’s Day. This is — you know, as you pointed out on your show, it’s overwhelmingly women who are providing the services that are under attack. It’s not just labor that’s under attack; it’s the services that the labor is providing that’s under attack: it’s healthcare, it’s education, it’s those fundamental care-giving services across the country, which could be profitable if they were privatized. AMY GOODMAN: In Ohio, more than 20,000 people marched to oppose the Republican Governor John Kasich’s attempted anti-union legislative putsch. Kasich recently defended his policy proposals on Fox & Friends. GOV. JOHN KASICH: It’s part of a big piece of reform. Come March the 15th, we will be reforming Medicaid, K-through-12, higher ed, prisons. It is going to be a reform agenda in Ohio like no one has ever seen, all designed to get us in a good position. In terms of unions? I respect unions. I come from a union family. I mean, the idea that we’re attacking anybody is — look, what we’re attacking: poverty, joblessness. OK, that’s what I’m attacking. And all I’m doing is saying to everybody, participate. Everybody jump in this. Together, we can make Ohio stronger. If we do not do that, you know, then we’ll continue to lose jobs, and that means misery for everybody. That’s not going to happen. We are going to be successful here. AMY GOODMAN: Republican Governor John Kasich, going back to his old haunt. He was a commentator for a long time for Fox and, before that, a conservative congressman. NAOMI KLEIN: You know, the reason why this isn’t working and why people are so outraged by it and why they’re in the streets and we’re finally seeing the resistance in this country that we have seen in Europe, with this chant, “We won’t pay for your crisis,” that really started in 2008 in Greece and spread to Italy and France and England — and, you know, the rest of the world has been waiting for the United States to — you know, how much are Americans going to take of this? It seems that Americans were willing to say, you know, “We will pay for your crisis, and would you like a tax break with that?” Right? And finally, they went too far. And so, that resistance is finally happening. And this attack on collective bargaining, the reason why people won’t take it is precisely because they understand that this is not shared pain. It is not being shared equally. The people who created the crisis in the first place are not sharing the pain. And the injustice of this response is so blatant. This isn’t just any economic crisis. This tactic has worked. And this is, you know, what I’ve tracked over a 30-year period, that it is really easy to use an economic crisis — people panic, hyperinflation, issues like that. In the '90s, when Newt Gingrich was Speaker, it was possible for him to argue that the source of the budget crisis really was so-called entitlement programs. You cannot do that in this moment in history because everybody understands that the crisis was created on Wall Street, it was created through speculation and greed, and a decision was made to bail out the bankers with public money and to pass the bill on to the public. And they're seeing the bonuses back. They’re seeing the outrageous salaries. They’re seeing corporations not paying their taxes. And it’s just too unjust. It’s just so morally outrageous. And then to turn on the television and talk about everybody sharing the pain? I mean, people are just not that stupid. Thankfully. AMY GOODMAN: And where does the Obama administration fit into this? NAOMI KLEIN: Yeah. AMY GOODMAN: We have played that clip of President Obama when he was running for president, saying, “If anyone challenges your collective union rights, I will be walking with you.” NAOMI KLEIN: Yeah. Well, I mean, this is the irony of this moment, and this is — it really is about democracies. Scott Walker was not elected with a mandate to bust unions and to strip collective bargaining rights. He did not mention that in his campaign. He talked about balancing the budget. He made some vague statements, you know, about shared sacrifice. But he absolutely did not campaign promising to do what he is now doing. Obama, on the other hand, campaigned promising to strengthen union rights. He promised, again and again, whenever he had a labor audience, that he was going to pass the Employee Free Choice Act, and he promised to stand with them. And, you know, one of the things that’s so important for us to understand about why — you know, there are many reasons why the resistance is so strong in Wisconsin and why they’ve become this beacon for not just the rest of the country, but the world, and so much of it, I think — you know, my colleague at The Nation, John Nichols, has written beautifully about it this week in a cover story where he talks about the rich sense of collective history, of collective memory, and the fact that people know their progressive history in Wisconsin, so they’re harder to exploit. You know, they’re not going to fall for the latest Fox News messaging, because they know their history. But, you know, this is — there’s something else that’s going on here. And, well, I mean, I’ll just let you take it from there. AMY GOODMAN: Well, let me ask you about Michigan. NAOMI KLEIN: Yeah. AMY GOODMAN: And then we’re going to go to a break. NAOMI KLEIN: Yeah. AMY GOODMAN: About a thousand people rallied in Michigan — NAOMI KLEIN: Yeah. AMY GOODMAN: — reminiscent of Wisconsin. Talk about the proposal there. NAOMI KLEIN: Well, I just found out about this last night, and like I said, there’s so much going on that these extraordinary measures are just getting lost in the shuffle. But in Michigan, there is a bill that’s already passed the House. It’s on the verge of passing the Senate. And I’ll just read you some excerpts from it. It says that in the case of an economic crisis, that the governor has the authority to authorize the emergency manager — this is somebody who would be appointed — to reject, modify or terminate the terms of an existing contract or collective bargaining agreement, authorize the emergency manager for a municipal government — OK, so we’re not — we’re talking about towns, municipalities across the state — to disincorporate. So, an appointed official with the ability to dissolve an elected body, when they want to. AMY GOODMAN: A municipal government. NAOMI KLEIN: A municipal government. And it says specifically, “or dissolve the municipal government.” So we’ve seen this happening with school boards, saying, “OK, this is a failing school board. We’re taking over. We’re dissolving it. We’re canceling the contracts.” You know, what this reminds me of is New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, when the teachers were fired en masse and then it became a laboratory for charter schools. You know, people in New Orleans — and you know this, Amy — warned us. They said, “What’s happening to us is going to happen to you.” And I included in the book a quote saying, “Every city has their Lower Ninth Ward.” And what we’re seeing with the pretext of the flood is going to be used with the pretext of an economic crisis. And this is precisely what’s happening. So it starts with the school boards, and then it’s whole towns, whole cities, that could be subject to just being dissolved because there’s an economic crisis breaking collective bargaining agreements. It also specifies that — this bill specifies that an emergency manager can be an individual or a firm. Or a firm. So, the person who would be put in charge of this so-called failing town or municipality could actually be a corporation. AMY GOODMAN: Whose government they dissolve, a company takes over. NAOMI KLEIN: A company takes over. So, they have created, if this passes, the possibility for privatization of a whole town by fiat. And this is actually a trend in the contracting out of public services, where you do now have whole towns, like Sandy Springs in Georgia, run by private companies. It’s very lucrative. Why not? You start with just the water contract or the electricity contract, but eventually, why not privatize the whole town? So — AMY GOODMAN: And what happens then? Where does democracy fit into that picture? NAOMI KLEIN: Well, this is an assault on democracy. It’s a frontal assault on democracy. It’s a kind of a corporate coup d’état at the municipal level. AMY GOODMAN: We’re talking to Naomi Klein, author of The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism. Stay with us. [break] AMY GOODMAN: Our guest for the hour is Naomi Klein — yes, the journalist and author. Her latest book is called Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism. You can go to our Facebook page, and you can post questions there for her and just continue to participate in the dialogue. Let me ask you a question that came to us from Facebook. This is a question about the Madison protest for you, posted on our Facebook page. Kevin Williams — Kelvin Williams asks, “Are there any specific ways that Wisconsin workers can use the ideas in [your book] 'The Shock Doctrine' to go on the offensive and force true fiscal responsibility, perhaps even rolling back the compromise contract?” NAOMI KLEIN: Mm-hmm. It’s a great question. I think what’s finally starting to happen, and this is — Wisconsin has really been going from one victory after another. This started off with an attack, but people have been — have just found such incredible reserves of resolve and dignity and collective history that the ground is shifting. So, the situation under which those compromises were made, those concessions were made, it’s changed. You know, people are feeling their power and their possibility. AMY GOODMAN: I mean, it’s amazing now. The Governor, who was just elected, Scott Walker, a few months ago, is now — his popularity has dipped to the 30s. NAOMI KLEIN: Mm-hmm. AMY GOODMAN: And even the conservative newspapers are asking serious questions. NAOMI KLEIN: Mm-hmm, yeah. I mean, he clearly made a real miscalculation. I mean, what was obvious is that he was really playing to the national stage. He’s clearly a very ambitious guy. He’s got real national political aspirations. I think that’s clear. You know, in that conversation with fake David Koch, the prank call, he compares himself to Reagan. He compares his actions to Reagan’s firing of the air traffic controllers, that sort of “shot heard around the world” moment. That’s what he wanted, you know? And he is not getting that. AMY GOODMAN: And then he said, first he fired the PATCO strikers, and then the Berlin Wall came down. He made that link. NAOMI KLEIN: He said it. And it’s not a crazy link, in the sense that it was part of a frontal assault on labor and the left, and it continued for many, many years. But, you know, it’s not the ’80s anymore, and people are on to these tactics. And I do think — you know, just coming back to that question — that it is possible. But the real key is that we have to be having the debate about where the money should be coming from. I mean, if there is a fiscal crisis — and in Wisconsin, there’s a crisis that was created by tax cuts, and this is why there’s so much outrage, because it comes back to that false claim that there’s shared sacrifice here. There isn’t shared sacrifice here. There are gifts that are being handed out to the elites. Scott Walker is governing based on this radical free market ideology that if we just create the perfect, most hospitable, most gentle, less demanding conditions for corporations to do business, then we’ll have a booming economy, and it will trickle down, and everyone will benefit. And that is exactly the ideology that Obama campaigned against — and won — saying we can’t keep giving more and more to the people at the top and waiting for it to trickle down. And that was a message that really resonated with voters. One thing I wanted to come back to that I was starting to get at earlier about why what’s happening in Wisconsin is happening in Wisconsin and what we need to take from it is that when bad things are happening, it’s helpful to have a bad guy. And Scott Walker is a good bad guy. And he has galvanized progressives. And people have, you know, an enemy to organize around and to point out these disparities. It hasn’t happened at the federal level, despite the fact that Obama is also involved in attacking labor rights with his pushing of charter schools and draconian budget cuts. He’s not a good bad guy for progressives. So, we’re still in a situation where Obama is getting away with, in my opinion, shock doctrine-style tactics, because people don’t — still don’t want to believe that Obama is doing it, too. So, when you have an easy bad guy, a Republican governor who’s obviously trying to be the reincarnation of Ronald Reagan, you can mobilize the left. But it won’t just work if we are only going after the Republicans and if this is fought along just partisan lines, as opposed to being fought based on principle. No matter who is doing it, we need to be mobilizing, if it’s Obama, if it’s Scott Walker. AMY GOODMAN: And the people that President Obama surrounds himself with, especially when it comes to the Wall Street insiders, especially as we move into the 2012 election, when it’s said Obama will raise more than a billion dollars for the presidential election? NAOMI KLEIN: Mm-hmm. Yeah, I mean, there’s a lot of denial, still, about who Obama is and who he surrounds himself with. And, you know, we’re going to talk a little bit later about Tim DeChristopher, but I’ve said it many times: Obama is fundamentally a centrist. And I do think that when there is a mobilized progressive movement in the United States that is putting pressure on him, on Democrats in Congress, they will respond. And that’s another lesson that we can take from Wisconsin. You know, I was talking, once again, to John Nichols the other day, and he said, “What’s really working here is that we have the inside-outside pincer.” Right? You’ve got people in the streets, but you also have Democrat — Democratic lawmakers willing to put themselves on the line, being surprisingly courageous, leaving the state, and blocking it. So it isn’t just the people in the Rotunda. It isn’t just the protesters at the rally. It’s a kind of a partnership that’s going on. Why is that happening? Well, they looked out the window, and they saw their voters in the streets really committed and really mobilized, and that gave them courage. And that’s something really important to remember about how — you know, so many liberal groups are involved in this gentle backroom lobbying, a token protest here and there, which says, “I’m willing to spend a couple of hours on a Saturday, but I’m not really willing to fight to win.” And what’s going on in Wisconsin is something very different. It’s not just a rally on a Saturday afternoon. It is people really upending their lives for weeks and weeks and weeks on end. That sends a message to politicians who want to get re-elected that this is a big issue, a top priority. And they hear that. AMY GOODMAN: We’re talking to Naomi Klein, author of The Shock Doctrine, as we turn now to Tim DeChristopher."
"What happens when someone with no executive experience takes over the toughest executive job in the world? Since we’ve not seen that situation in most of our lifetimes — even John Kennedy, the last President elected with no executive experience in government or the private sector, had some command experience in the Navy — we had little hard evidence to predict failure to manage the executive branch of the US government, but it was rather easy to presume that on-the-job training at that level would be problematic, to say the least. Today, the Washington Post reports that even Barack Obama’s own Cabinet has been so mismanaged that Obama had to create a new position to run it for him: During the first two years of President Obama‘s term, the administration fully embraced just a few of his superstar picks – people such as Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and Education Secretary Arne Duncan. But many more agency chiefs conducted their business in relative anonymity, sometimes after running afoul of White House officials. Both sides were deeply disgruntled. Agency heads privately complained that the White House was a “fortress” that was unwilling to accept input and that micromanaged their departments. Senior administration advisers rolled their eyes in staff meetings at the mention of certain Cabinet members, participants said. … The larger mission is to make the dealings between the Cabinet and the White House more functional, several senior officials said. Daley, a former commerce secretary himself, has been calling agency heads for input, asking about the process over the past two years – and promising that it will change. At the same time, the White House recently created the position of Cabinet communications director, appointing media adviser Tom Gavin to the job. The goal, according to the official statement, is “to better coordinate with and utilize members of the Cabinet” and is a “high priority.” It’s difficult to know where to start with this. First, managing access to the President is the job of the chief of staff, and the person responsible for managing the CoS is the President. Anne Kornblut reports that Daley’s predecessor, Rahm Emanuel, thought the Cabinet was “useless” and bypassed them in favor of the Obama inner circle. Oddly, it didn’t occur to Obama to change this, according to Daley, who said in an interview that Obama told him that “‘I want to see these people more often.” It sounds as though Emanuel ran Obama rather than the other way around. Also, remember that this deals specifically with the Cabinet, not career officials running lower-rung bureaucracies. These are Obama’s own choices to run the major agencies of his administration. The fact that Obama needs an intervention to deal with his own hand-picked staff tells us all we need to know about Obama’s growth in executive management over the last two years. Does that make Gavin a “czar”? Not really, at least not in an objectionable sense. The coordination of a President’s Cabinet with the White House falls entirely within presidential authority, and Obama can have his staff handle those duties as he sees fit. In fact, the irony here is that one big reason that Cabinet officials feel isolated is because of the explosion of czars in the Obama administration: Part of the problem, people on both sides said, has been an abundance of issue specialists – the “czars” – who manage matters on the environment and the economy within the West Wing. “The White House loops people out. The czars keep people from getting in,” said one senior Democratic official who has fielded such complaints from three agency heads. “The level of frustration is pretty high.” We saw a hint of this when Judd Gregg accepted and then declined Obama’s offer to become Commerce Secretary at the beginning of his term. Gregg initially accepted, and then discovered that Obama had carved him out of input on the Porkulus package as well as control of the Census. Gregg would have just served as window dressing while his czars exert all of the real authority. Anyone who had worked in a management capacity in nearly any context would have predicted exactly that kind of conflict on the staff. Basically, Gavin will provide the kind of executive talent that Obama lacks. It’s an embarrassment, and a reminder why Americans usually choose governors and other proven executives for the top job, rather than a talentless rookie. "
"Link copied. We want to bridge divides to reach everyone. The ouster of NPR chief Vivian Schiller will probably not quiet conservative outrage unleashed by an uncover video. White House, by contrast, has no plans to alter its funding request for Corporation for Public Broadcasting and NPR. Loading... March 9, 2011 NPR President and CEO Vivian Schiller resigned under pressure on Wednesday amid a storm of negative reaction to an undercover video that showed another NPR executive denigrating tea party adherents and saying that public radio might be better off without federal funds. Will the ouster of Ms. Schiller quiet conservative outrage at the incident? After all, it was she who approved the firing of NPR commentator Juan Williams over comments about Muslims he made during a Fox News appearance last October. At the time, many conservatives (though not only conservatives) complained that Mr. Williams had been axed in the name of political correctness. They thought Schiller should have gotten the boot then, too. Long answer short: No, it does not look as if Wednesday’s events will end things. If anything, it appears that Republican lawmakers now may redouble their efforts to end federal funding for public broadcasting. The Juan Williams treatment: Five other ousted media personalities House majority leader Eric Cantor (R) of Virginia even chuckled when asked about the incident by reporters Wednesday. “Perhaps the truth finally came out,” he said. Representative Cantor specifically mentioned that the now-former NPR executive caught in the video sting, Ron Schiller (who is no relation to Ms. Schiller), said that public radio might have more independence and be better able to raise funds from other sources if it lost its government subsidy. “We are going to proceed along those lines because that’s what was said and indicated by that organization,” said Cantor. Meanwhile, NPR employees were in shock in the aftermath of the video’s release, according to NPR Ombudsman Alicia Shepard. Ron Schiller had swept into the organization 18 months ago, hailed as an extraordinary fundraiser who might save public radio from financial woes, writes Ms. Shepard in a cri de coeur post on her blog. “Instead of being a ‘savior,’ Schiller might well have put a stake through NPR and public radio’s financial hearts,” writes Shepard. Critics have long complained that NPR is a bunch of effete liberal snobs. On the hidden camera video, Mr. Schiller looks like a caricature of just such a person. He says the Republican Party is “anti-intellectual” and the tea party is “xenophobic,” and implies that conservatives are uneducated. Plus, he himself makes the argument as to why NPR should lose federal funds. “People at NPR yesterday were angry and dazed by this episode, which is just the latest in a series of events that put the company in the worst possible light. Doesn’t anyone in NPR’s top management think of the consequences before they act?” wrote Shepard. NPR’s missteps looked even worse after its television counterpart in public funding, PBS, announced that it had been approached by the same fake Muslim charity, the Muslim Education Action Center, but had halted discussions about a possible donation after it was not able to verify the organization’s credentials. The false website put up by the group still exists, though now it has a cover note from conservative activist James O’Keefe admitting the ruse and asking for donations to his group, Project Veritas. Hindsight has 20/20 vision, without corrective lenses. But a quick perusal of the fake website produces some obvious red flags. The false Muslim group purports to have a philosophy that includes the “spread of Islam and the establishment of Sharia worldwide.” Sharia is Islamic law, and some critics have long insisted that one goal of radical Islamists is to impose sharia throughout the globe. The website also lists an address for the group that is within an easy stroll of NPR headquarters. A public radio intern could have walked over at lunch just to see if it really existed. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which makes grants to public radio and television, is getting about $430 million this fiscal year. President Obama’s 2012 budget request would give CPB slight raise. White House spokesman Jay Carney said Wednesday that the current controversy would not affect the administration’s views on the subject. “The budget makes clear the president’s priorities, and among them are the funding at the level that we stipulate in the budget for National Public Radio and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting,” said Mr. Carney.

"We are constantly expanding our inventory to give you the best domains available for purchase! Read or Listen to the Free Book! The top business book that also teaches to give back. This domain name will potentially help you bring in more customers and profits every day, as the domain itself goes up in value. A super premium .Com domain name from DomainMarket.com means instant branding, search engine, and marketing benefits. We make it safe, easy and affordable for you to own .com right away. DomainMarket.com domains are carefully selected for branding excellence by the world's top domain name appraisers, so you will only find the most prized and premium assets for sale. If the value of one new lifelong customer and its references makes up for the domain cost, imagine how a great domain from DomainMarket.com will benefit when it helps you attract multitudes of unexpected new customers (whose value far surpasses the domain value, which keeps rising). Review the Microsoft study proving this phenomenon: ""Domain Bias in Web Search"" This domain is offered for sale by its owner currently at the ""buy it now"" price listed ""BIN"" Click here to purchase .com, but could be withdrawn at any time or its price potentially substantially raised. Also, once sold, the next owner, your domain competitor, would likely never re-sell it again, especially to his competitor; and would instead try to take all your customers and potential customers, year after year, to the extent possible, which you should do to them by purchasing the domain first. You may find a Make Offer button on certain higher value domains; but beware, expressing demand in a domain or visiting a URL usually raises its price. You can buy at the current price at any time, as long as you are first, and its still being offered for sale. The issue to recognize is that the current price naturally trends upwards over time, then additionally based on traffic, expressed interest, and other apparent demand. So time is of the essence, especially right now, with prices escalating precipitously. For serious companies and marketing executives, attracting just one new lifetime customer, business partner, or employee, leveraging a premium domain, will justify this excellent long-term investment. But in fact, your DomainMarket.com sourced super premium domain is likely to rake in many valuable new customers and opportunities in the long run that normally couldn't or wouldn’t find you. Compared to the risk and sunk costs of traditional advertising channels, or newer online advertising methods, this is clearly a huge home run. Other types of advertising are not resellable assets like domains, with long term investment opportunity; other advertising investments are all very risky comparatively, and are mostly wasted if you think about it. First come, first served. Don't miss this once in a lifetime opportunity to be #1. The first person or company to secure .com from this site can control it forever, to the exclusion of all others. It will become out of our control. Get it first; and get ranked first in Google! All that matters online is Location Location Location! Your Domain is Your Location! and brand, and future profits; dont shortchange it obviously! You can redirect your new domain traffic to your existing internet assets until you are done with development, or indefinitely, if you prefer. Would you really consider shortchanging your permanent global brand by skipping the perfect .Com and letting someone else dominate online forever, and potentially offline? That would be a very costly mistake for your family's future and for the other stakeholders of your entity; everyone similarly situated regrets it. The world's best companies and smartest professionals always rely on DomainMarket.com and our super-premium, contextual .Com domains to leverage their branding opportunities. 500 out of 500 of the 'Fortune 500' corporations use .Com, and all of the world's best salespeople and marketers; they aren’t going anywhere. Dozens of others could use your trade name or trademark in a variety of industries, but only one of you can be smart enough to control the .Com customer traffic forever. If you don't own the exact match .Com premium domain best suited for your offerings then over time your brand and site is likely to get lost in Google and in the minds of potential customers; rendered irrelevant. Plus, it would be super embarassing and costly for your customers or prospects to land on this site when they are actually looking to purchase from you instead. Plus you may be able to profit from the consumer traffic, ""eyeballs"", and sell advertising space or use Google AdWords on the domain site, to your financial advantage. Our partner SEO.com are a team of world class digital marketing experts and select Google Partners. We recommend you contact them for any assistance with online advertising, marketing, SEO, PPC, landing page optimization, ecommerce, conversion optimization, web design, Facebook ads and more. Super premium .com domain names from DomainMarket.com are the start and top of the economic food chain, in order to create the best on and offline 'unicorn' corporations. Pick the wrong domain and you deserve the consequences of your competitors rolling you.

""Ring.com [sold for $1B] was previously called DoorBot, His tenacity, and the decision to stick with the product he originally built [but with better domain], has paid off in a big way."" Almost all decent TV ads now use premium generic .Com too, and radio ads, plus sides of trucks, billboards, bumper stickers, boats, planes, tshirts, blogs, etc. You may be one of these 'Fortune 500' mega corporations ready to dominate the world, or just a regular granny in your underwear, but either way you can look the same with .com. DomainMarket.com is the only authorized pricing agent for this domain name, anyone else is a third party seller. Every domain price on this site is completed by top world experts from AccurateAppraisals.com. It's critical to secure your domain today if you want to control the world class branding and recognition before your competitors who are eyeing it. They might outcompete you forever if they get it first and get all the traffic, conversions, and branding value compounded endlessly. A premium domain could easily add 20% compounding yearly to a company's bottom line profits if deployed properly, which for most companies would prevent them from going out of business. Would you seriously consider letting someone else control your best possible name, Internet branding, and Google positioning forever if you could avoid it? You can control it right now. There is extreme marketing power behind the perfect domain to promote your products and services. Owning a popular English expression and brand online is the Holy Grail for perpetually converting lower cost new customers. Super premium domains from our marketplace generally rise in resale value, and can be reused or resold at any price if you are ever done capitalizing on them, or if you are a domain investor. Sales prices at our market have doubled over the last few years, and likely will again due to worldwide Internet growth, prestige, the general scarcity of super premium .Com domains, historically high demand, and the failure of all competing ""gTLDs"". We have been in business for over 10 years and have sold more of our premium domains than any of our competitors. At our previous company (BuyDomains.com) we launched the whole online premium domain trading industry in 1998. Waiting to purchase your favorite domain is a financial mistake, or, even worse, you may never be able to get it at all, at any price, if someone buys it first. It's much less risky to purchase a super premium domain and name your business accordingly, than any other choices; or at least redirect the free customer traffic to your site. Why would anyone choose to increase their business risks with inferior branding and domains? The ever increasing demand for internet sourced information and services, and premium domain investments is the very bandwagon you need to hop on. The trend is your friend! You may own all the tradenames, trademarks, logos, and social sites in the world, but exact match .Com possession ranking in Google is ten tenths of marketing/branding 'law'. You need to control the keywords and keyword combination strings relevant to your company and industry, forever if possible; bidding on words and paying over and over for advertising is a considerable risk, but buying the .Com is a certainty. The perfect domain, without compromising yourself and your brand, has to come first for a serious business, in order to set yourself apart from all wannabe competitors, and create long term leverage with your other communications and potential advertising. If you pick this domain you may not need expensive, super risky advertising at all, or at least not as much. You also need properly branded professional email if you want to appear professional and convert the highest number of customers at the highest profits. Using Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook, AOL, instead of your own properly branded email address is foolish and unprofessional and fails to add leverage to your brand, or use the leverage from your brand, which should have been professionally built from day one. But no time like the present. Premium domains will keep going up in price due to a ""flight to quality"", millions of global companies, people and projects requiring great branding perpetually. Domain names lower in branding quality than the Super Premium .Com level DomainMarket.com specializes in are far too risky to be considered investments, like all the new “gTLD” domains, or very low level .Coms. They are hobbies at best and more likely just a complete waste. But the right .Com is the ideal investment and marketing vehicle for anyone with ambition. Speaking of ambition; your boss and coworkers will love you; and you may just get a raise, if you improve the URL, email addresses and branding for everyone, forever. Anybody who might have told you that .Com domains would go away, lose value, be replaced by other domain extensions or technologies was totally wrong, or worse. In some cases a premium domain can be effective in helping with your tax strategy too (please ask your accountant for details); or can work as an alternative asset (like Bitcoin), a way to store investment value in ""the cloud"" forever, that is easy, anonymous, and cheap to control and move around (ask a pro). Each domain in our marketplace is individually valued based on a series of attributes, developed by professionals for over two decades. We are the primary dealer for every single fabulous .Com domain listed on our site. Any other legitimate sellers are secondary. A delayed costly escrow process is not necessary to complete your transaction, as we have been the trusted dealer for tens of thousands of domain transactions and transfers, without a glitch. DomainMarket.com is the best known and most trusted competitor in the premium domain name industry. In any event, if it makes you feel even more comfortable, Escrow.com is a purchase option for large transactions. The asking price for .com is based on a careful and professional appraisal by the world's leading experts on domain valuations, the inventors of ecommerce for premium domains. The price is explicitly certified to be fair by real experts, so the buyer can be confident in the great long-term value and investment opportunity for the unique domain asset in question. Your competition for a great domain, and therefore your opportunity to arbitrage or capitalize, is even greater than your normal business competition, because it includes your normal competition, plus any other company or person in the world that wants to invest in domains for the future, plus anyone who competes for the same word, expression, or brand in any marketing or media. For example if you are a lighting manufacturer competing for the domain 'BrightFuture.com' then all the educational institutions or websites in the world could become your competitor for domains, or partner potentially; or you could sell it to them at a huge profit if you are a good investor. Not to mention any religious institution would be well served with that domain. If you’ve ever been to a competitor’s marketplace you will find predominantly random, worthless domains, at prices that were derived without any logical appraisal process. But our domain appraisals and prices are very consistent with one another, regardless whether you appreciate any particular one. Competitors collections and sites with domain names for sale are unappraised mostly, inconsistent if they are priced, and are not done by true professionals oftentimes. Conversely, DomainMarket.com's for sale inventory is highly curated and cleaned for excellence, with proper pricing. Super-premium domain values generally range from $10,000 to $2 million. The average industry sales price is approximately $30,000. Our marketplace also has thousands of “close out” domains, at even lower prices! Building a fabulous online presence starts with a top-quality domain name from DomainMarket.com. Here, you'll find only the very best .Com domain names waiting to be developed into first-rate profitable brands. Domains are valued based on many factors such as marketability and brand-ability, the industry it is related to, similar domain sales, acquisition cost and, if applicable, the website traffic and associated revenue they can drive. A strong domain is one of the best investments you can make in your business, and can pay for itself many times over. Exact match domains from DomainMarket.com dramatically reduce the amount companies pay per click by improving their Quality Scores, the measure by which Google determines a keyword's relevance and cost. Your domain's Quality Score depends on alignment between the paid keyword, ad copy and landing page or website. The more a search query appears in an ad, including in the domain name/display URL, the more relevant the ad appears to the searcher.

Let us know if you need help getting paid or organic traffic; help in getting to the top of Google. This domain is likely to hold and increase its value over time. Poor domain names lose traffic and new customer conversions to better domain named companies, Microsoft Research calls this effect ""domain bias in web search."" .com is a category killer domain that may be commonly used around the world. Such a name offers your company a clear competitive advantage online and off. .com is relatively easy to spell / highly memorable. Trust and recognition from such a great name drives higher click through rates. Only one person or entity can have it and utilize it online and offline for marketing and advertising (and maintain all future resale rights at any price or profit level). Establish your company, product or service dominance with an outstanding .Com brand. For existing brands, it is the ideal opportunity to re-enforce and protect your brand. Historically, exact match keywords have been rated higher in relevancy for search engine ranking.

"Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) got some headlines for breaking down in tears during the Homeland Security Committee hearing on Thursday, but another witness, Abdirizak Bihi, Director of the Somali Education and Social Advocacy Center in Minneapolis, offered something more newsworthy—an indictment of Ellison himself. Although he didn’t identify Ellison by name, Bihi’s criticism of local leaders, religious and political, was seen as partly a reference to Ellison being an obstacle to finding out what happened to 20 Somali young people who had disappeared from Ellison’s congressional district and showed up in Somalia as terrorists. No wonder Ellison had called the hearing a “witch-hunt.” He was the witch. As noted in advance by the Minneapolis Star-Tribune, “Bihi has been publicly critical of Ellison’s handling of the disappearance of some 20 Somali youths recruited by a Jihadist group in their native country.” Bihi’s nephew Burhan Hassan was killed in Somalia after traveling there to join Al-Shabbab, a terrorist organization working to overthrow the Somali government. But it wasn’t just Ellison, the first Muslim elected to Congress. The Star-Tribune previously reported that Bihi had “accused the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) Minnesota chapter of discouraging local Somalis from cooperating with the FBI” in trying to find out what happened. The FBI had cited CAIR’s links to terrorist groups. But Ellison has worked with CAIR and has spoken at their events. In his opening statement, chairman Peter King (R-NY) called on the media to tell the truth about CAIR. He noted that CAIR “was named as an unindicted co-conspirator in the terrorist financing case involving the Holy Land Foundation” and that “In the lead-up to this hearing I found it shocking and sad that the mainstream media accepted CAIR’s accusations as if it were a legitimate organization.” King added, “Thankfully, FBI Director Mueller has ordered the FBI to cease all dealings and contact with CAIR. I would hope that all law enforcement officials would follow the lead of the FBI Director.” The witness invited by the Democratic members of the committee was Sheriff Leroy Baca of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department. He said, in response to questions from the Republican side, that he was not familiar with CAIR’s terrorist links. Bihi was restricted, like other witnesses, to five minutes in his opening remarks. In his prepared testimony, Bihi went into detail about how the leadership of his local mosque, as well as CAIR, obstructed the search for the missing youth. He said, “the mosque leadership was always in the mode of ‘double-speak,’ cling to the larger community in English that they were victims of our efforts to find our ‘fake’ missing children and creating open house events in the mosque where big organizations such as the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) would stand beside the mosque leaders and support them blindly, without having ever met with the families of the missing Somali youths (even though we had requested several times to meet with CAIR, but never did as we were left without a response).” As he began making progress in the inquiry, he said, “powerful organizations such as CAIR stepped into our community and stifled whatever progress we had made by trying to tell our Somali American community not to cooperate with law enforcement. CAIR held meetings for some members of the community and told them not to talk to the FBI, which was a slap in the face for the Somali American Muslim mothers who were knocking on doors day and night with pictures of their missing children and asking for the community to talk to law enforcement about what they know of the missing kids. It was a slap in the face for community activists who had invested time and personal resources to educate the community about forging a good relationship with law enforcement in order to stop the radicalization and recruitment of our children. We held three different demonstrations against CAIR, in order to get them to leave us alone so we can solve our community’s problems, since we don’t know CAIR and they don’t speak for us. We wanted to stop them from dividing our community by stepping into issues that don’t belong to them.” He said that CAIR and other Islamic organizations had ignored problems “such as the radicalization of our vulnerable youth, a growing trend of human trafficking and increasing youth violence. We regret the silencing and intimidation faced by leaders and activists who dare to speak out on the real challenges that keep our youth and community vulnerable to radicalization. Burying our heads in the sand will not make this problem go away.” In his testimony, however, Ellison rebutted the charges, saying, “Unfortunately, some leaders continue to misrepresent events in my own community of Minneapolis. For example, this week the Chairman [Peter King] was on the Morning Joe TV show and said, ‘how about the number of young Somali men who went to Somalia and the Imams and the leaders in the Minneapolis Muslim community refused to cooperate [with them] at all. They were denying for a long time that they even left.’” King’s statement was based on what Bihi had been saying about the lack of cooperation he was getting from some local Muslim leaders, including Ellison. Ellison cled, “This sweeping statement regarding the community I represent is simply not true.” But Bihi’s testimony was proof of the cl. Ellison testified that he had made a presentation, sponsored by the George Soros-funded Center for American Progress (CAP), called “Strengthening America’s Security: Identifying, Preventing and Responding to Domestic Terrorism.” He explained, “My presentation addressed causes of violent extremism and solutions for prevention and intervention.” Ellison should know something about domestic terrorism, having been a vocal supporter of communist terrorists such as Sara Jane Olson, a member of the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA), and Bernardine Dohrn, the former leader of the communist terrorist Weather Underground. In a speech, Ellison had also praised cop-killers Mumia Abu-Jamal, on death row in Pennsylvania, and Joanne Chesimard (aka Assata Shakur), who escaped the U.S. and is now living under the protection of the Castro dictatorship. His advice to the CAP audience was for Congress to introduce and pass a bill to end racial profiling. In an interview afterward with CAP’s Think Progress blog, he attacked the use of Predator drones to assassinate suspected terrorists. Ironically, he declared in this July 14, 2010 event that “Congress should also empanel a commission to study the roots of radicalization. Now, such a proposal was made in the recent past. I supported it, received some criticism from some friends. But I think the real problem is not that we would study the roots of radicalization, but that we don’t know nearly enough about it.” He went on, “We need to know more about violent radicalization. What turns people towards this? Why? When? Where? Who is susceptible; who’s not? And we need to use that information not to violate civil and human rights, but to promote conditions where people feel integrated, a part and trusting of their government.” Yet, when Rep. King convenes a hearing on this very topic, Ellison leads the opposition and asks to be included as a critical witness. Perhaps his turnaround had to do with the fact that he had anticipated that one of the other witnesses would be critical of his performance in finding out what happened to the Somali youth and how they were turned into terrorists. Ellison’s tears in his testimony came in discussing a Muslim-American who died while working as a paramedic during the 9/11 attacks. “As he concluded his testimony, Ellison knocked his glasses to wipe away tears, and briefly covered his face with the papers from which he had been reading,” noted the Star-Tribune. Ellison did not weep for the Somali young people from his own district who were killed in Somalia. They included Bihi’s 18-year-old nephew, who was shot and killed.

"Advertisement ""The truth is that feminism is the single worst thing that happened to American women."" So wrote Suzanne Venker and her aunt, Phyllis Schlafly, in ""The Flipside of Feminism"" What Conservative Women Know – and Men Can't Say."" Advertisement - story continues below And if that doesn’t elicit feminist fury or bewilderment, what will? But it's more reason for feminists and non-feminists to read this new title published by  Books. After all, you'll see people you know, people you love – maybe even yourself – in ""The Flipside of Feminism,"" the authors say. ""My hope is that any person between the ages of 18 and 50, male or female, who feels as though they've absorbed feminist ideology, will read this book,"" said Venker, who describes herself first and foremost as a wife and mom, even though she's authored a previous book and numerous articles. TRENDING: Christian superstar urges faithful to demand probe of Afghanistan catastrophe Schlafly, author or editor of 20 books, founder of the Eagle Forum, and Supreme Court attorney most famous for leading the Equal Rights Amendment defeat, hopes that the young will read ""Flipside"" before they make ""too many mistakes."" ""I want them to understand that everything the feminists are telling us is really a lie,"" said the widow, and proud mother and grandmother. ""Feminism teaches young women to think of themselves as victims of the patriarchy. That's so unfortunate because American women are the most fortunate who have ever lived – we can make anything we want of our lives."" Advertisement - story continues below What, then, is this thing that Venker and Schlafly call the ""F word""? In brief, feminism is the radical agenda of what they dubbed ""the Feminine Left."" For example, typically feminists seek all the powers of men while hating men and ultimately despising their own feminine nature. This is but one contradiction in feminist agenda. And once feminists declared men unnecessary, they engineered big government to take the place of husbands and fathers, the authors say. ""The animus against men is very evident in what they're doing,"" said Schlafly. ""They look upon marriage as a dreary life. Betty Friedan called the housewife 'a parasite who lives in a concentration camp.' Gloria Steinem said you become a 'semi-nonperson' when you get married. A lot of these feminist leaders came out of dysfunctional families and they're projecting their personal problems onto society."" Advertisement - story continues below As the authors explain, ""feminism is in the air."" Liberal or unwitting parents indoctrinate their children at home, teachers push it in school and college, then in college or work, young women are taught to think only of themselves, chasing careers rather than love and family. As a result, many women resort to casual sex, spend long hours at work, and wake up in midlife realizing their lives are empty. Other women marry, concentrate on their careers, and abandon their families with no-fault divorce, they write. Nevertheless, Schlafly and Venker, who write in a scholarly but fluid, tough-love and maternal way, found that most women want to be married and even more want to have children. ""Heartache, broken relationships, failed marriages, sexually-transmitted diseases, abortion, and skyrocketing rates of emotionally wounded children have been the real legacy of feminism. It turns out – no surprise – that human nature cannot be repealed, overturned by judicial fiat, or reshaped by media messages,"" said Schlafly. Advertisement - story continues below For these authors, the wreckage of feminism isn't just some study. Like many American men, it seems Venker's first husband had taken feminism to heart. ""In our chapter on marriage, and in the last chapter with our roadmap, I talk about how geography is an issue for women today,"" said Venker. ""Because so many women go away to school and get degrees so far away from home, their chances of meeting someone from out of state and then staying away are great. It's making motherhood stressful because mothers don't have support and help from their own moms. That's what happened in my case. ""We were living in New York and I wanted to come back to St. Louis, but my husband was a New Yorker and I just couldn't get him to do that,"" she said. ""When I explained to him that family, specifically motherhood, was going to be the focus of my life and I wanted to be near my family, it just didn't work with him because he had absorbed feminist ideology: He was fine with abortion, casual sex and then he wasn't willing to move so that we could have family at the center of our lives."" Heartache isn't the only expense of feminism. Schlafly stressed that because of broken families, especially single mothers, 40 percent of Americans now depend on government for all or part of their living expenses, and that cost to taxpayers is about $1 trillion per year. Advertisement - story continues below Considering today's turbulent times and tea party activism, one of the best parts of ""Flipside"" tells how and why the Equal Rights Amendment failed. Yes, years after Betty Freidan told Phyllis Schlafly, ""I'd like to burn you at the stake,"" left-wing tactics are just as ugly and violent today. While Venker said that ""feminism has sabotaged women's happiness,"" she wrote the book because she believes it's never too late for women and men to change. ""It's my hope that people get charged – a renewed hopefulness – from having someone open up the door to a completely different way of viewing women in society, marriage, motherhood, work and sex and all things,"" said Venker. ""I hope that women – and men – realize that the [natural] things they're thinking are good and they're tired of having to follow the path set forth by all the feminists they've known, maybe feminist mothers or feminist professors. I hope they use this book to chart a new course."" Advertisement - story continues below ""The Flipside of Feminism,"" by Suzanne Venker and Phyllis Schlafly will be available March 15.

"Sign In ← return to Water Cooler *UPDATED with Boehner audio *UPDATED with letter from Bachmann and King Republicans ran their 2010 mid-term campaigns on chiefly the promise that the Democratic health care law would eventually be repealed, but in the meantime, de-funding the entire health care legislation would have to be a way to at least slow down the implementation of the law. H.R. 1 promised to accomplish the de-funding of Obamacare, but according to discoveries made by former Republican Oklahoma Congressman now a distinguish fellow at the Heritage Foundation Ernest Istook, the health care bill has a mandatory appropriation that would fund the legislation almost a decade into the future. Mr. Istook’s testimony on Wednesday about the matter revealed disturbing hidden funding that will make the health care legislation have life:(bolding is mine) The massive 2,700-page health care law is deliberately designed to make defunding and dismantlement difficult. Although original estimates reported that it created 159 new government agencies, the Congressional Research Service later concluded that the actual number of new agencies, boards, etc., “is currently unknowable,” because so many of them are empowered to spawn additional entities, just as weeds grow by sending out runners and seeds. The complexity and confusion extends to the funding process created in that legislation. The new law attempts to bypass the normal appropriations process, another feature that makes defunding more difficult. By making advance appropriations for tens of billions of dollars up to the year 2019, these provisions of Obamacare seek to remove spending decisions from the reach of the current Congress and from future Congresses and Presidents. Although Obamacare was not pitched to the public as a mandatory spending entitlement, the details of the legislation reveal an intent to block any future Congress from controlling Obamacare’s spending. One largely unknown fact is that $6-billion or more was immediately appropriated in the new law and approximately $105-billion more was appropriated for FY2011 and beyond. That violates the typical Congressional process of appropriations. The normal process typically involves enacting authorization bills that authorize spending, and then follows those with separate legislation that actually appropriates the money. This enables those to be balanced with other spending decisions. The PPACA contained large authorizations for future appropriations as well as containing these actual appropriations. That made it quite different from most bills, even major legislation. This funding also stayed below the radar screen because it was so often reported—inaccurately—that Congress had not passed any appropriations for the current fiscal year. Obviously, the last Congress chose to fund Obamacare even though they failed to pass any of the regular appropriations bills. For those who support that new law, this may present no problem. But the process should nevertheless offend their sense of an open, well-publicized and orderly process. The funding of Obamacare is a major concern for those many Americans– including me–who consider the law unwise, unaffordable, and detrimental to affordable and quality health care. To de-fund Obamacare, it is insufficient simply to deny future funding. Until the full law can be repealed, at least the existing and advance appropriations need to be rescinded, just as the House last month voted to repeal billions of dollars from previous appropriations to 123 federal programs. An effort to restrict use of the funds appropriated within Obamacare was thwarted because the House did not waive the same point of order (House Rule XXI) as it waived to allow de-funding those 123 other programs. This was most unfortunate. To any who do not realize that over $105-billion has already been appropriated to fund Obamacare, I direct your attention to the February 10, 2011, revision of the Congressional Research Service’s paper, “Appropriations and Fund Transfers in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA),” CRS number R41301. It documents the specific provisions that I’m discussing and the magnitude of those advance appropriations. Republican leadership appears to be vague about why Republicans did not bother to vote on rescinding the $105 billion dollar mandatory appropriation. Some argue that the fact the appropriation for the healthcare bill is mandatory and cannot be rescinded is not sitting well with conservatives, because as Mr. Istook points out in his testimony above, “The House last month voted to repeal billions of dollars from previous appropriations to 123 federal programs.” All those appropriations were mandatory as well. House Speaker John Boehner, Ohio Republican, believes rescinding appropriations in the healthcare bill can be done through committee. He told me on Thursday afternoon, “We made it pretty clear of that when we put Obamacare on the floor and the House passed the repeal of that bill. We’re going through regular order. I would expect that the committees of proper jurisdiction will bring forward the bill to eliminate mandatory spending that is involved in that bill.” AUDIO Rep. Michele Bachmann, Minnesota Republican, and Rep. Steve King, Iowa Republican, sent a letter to House GOP leadership on Thursday requesting that the health care appropriation be removed: Dear Speaker Boehner, Leader Cantor, and Chairman Rogers, We very much appreciate your leadership in bringing H.R. 2 to the floor, which resulted in a unanimous Republican vote to repeal ObamaCare. This was an essential step in achieving our universal Republican goal to bring about the final, 100% repeal of this law. No strategy to accomplish this goal could succeed without this House vote. From the moment legislation to repeal ObamaCare was first introduced, it has been widely discussed that a successful repeal strategy would center on first winning a Republican majority in the House, then holding a clean, up or down vote on repeal, and then prohibiting funding for the implementation or enforcement of ObamaCare. We must ensure that this strategy remains on track and on schedule. The success of our effort to shut off funding for ObamaCare will hinge on the leverage points of this first session of the 112th Congress - namely the CR, which expires on March 18th, and the vote on raising the debt ceiling. We recognize the work to defund ObamaCare began with the inclusion of language in H.R. 1 to restrict annual appropriations from being used to implement the law. However, we also recognize that even this language, if enacted, leaves on the table $105.5 billion in automatically appropriated funds for the law’s implementation. We cannot successfully defund ObamaCare without shutting off these automatically appropriated funds. While some have argued that our defunding efforts in the CR should be limited only to those annual funds actually provided by the CR, we disagree. If we do not stand our ground on the CR, leverage it as the “must pass bill” that it is, and use it to stop the $105.5 billion in automatically appropriated funds, ObamaCare will be implemented on our watch, we will have conceded a significant amount of ground on this issue, and we will find it difficult, if not impossible, to regain the strategic advantage in future legislative vehicles. Consequently, we ask that the following language, or more effective language, be added to the FY11 CR to cut off both the annual and automatic appropriations for ObamaCare’s implementation: “Notwithstanding any other provision of law, none of the funds made available by this or any previous Act with respect to any fiscal year may be used to carry out the provisions of Public Law 111-148, Public Law 111-152, or any amendment made by either such Public Law.” It is essential that the above language be included in the CR. We, the undersigned, will not vote in support of a continuing resolution that is void of this crucial funding prohibition.

"A comforting thought. If only it weren’t belied by an entire week’s worth of news. This is the sort of thing you’d say if NATO-armed rebels were advancing west and closing in on Qaddafi’s hideout in Tripoli. Instead, he’s talking about sanctions and the endless dithering happening among western powers on whether to intervene, which is transparently nothing more than procrastination to see what happens with this recent Qaddafi offensive. In fact, Obama himself admits in the clip that the economic “noose” might not be doing much strangling: Obama acknowledged that he remains “absolutely” concerned that Qaddafi could, via his military muscle, find a way to remain in power. “I think that’s why it’s so important for us not to stop where we are, but to continue to find options that will add additional pressure, including sending a clear message to those around Qaddafi that the world is watching and we’re paying attention, and that there have been referrals to the International Criminal Court,” he said. “There’s no doubt that I am concerned about it.” “Qaddafi has a stash of weapons,” Obama continued. “He not only has some troops that remain loyal to him, but there have been reports that he’s also been hiring mercenaries. Even with the financial freeze that we’ve imposed, he still has some assets. The rebel groups are just now getting organized. And so we’re going to have to continue to apply pressure, and that’s why I say we have not taken any options off the table at this point.” So they’re going to “continue to apply pressure,” even though there’s no compelling reason to believe Qaddafi can’t go on bankrolling massacres for weeks or months, the sanctions notwithstanding. In truth, the White House is looking for reasons not to intervene because it’s unpopular with the public and because, as J.E. Dyer explained earlier, it probably won’t do much good, but Obama can’t say that outright because it makes him look (even more) powerless in the face of degenerate brutality. So instead we’re “tightening the noose,” theoretically choking Qaddafi off even though not only has he now utterly crushed the rebels in the contested city of Zawiyah, he’s actually giving journalists tours of the area to prove it’s back in his control. Look on his works, ye mighty, and despair. For an argument on why we should intervene post haste, read David Frum. It boils down to protecting American prestige, but I don’t see how that would be enhanced if we impose a NFZ and, per J.E.’s nightmare, Qaddafi ends up rolling over the rebels anyway all the way back to Benghazi.

"There was an event that happened on Sunday, November 9, 2008, in Lansing, MI, that appears to have slipped under the radar of most Michigan and national news. According to Catholic Online, which appears to give the least biased account of the happenings at Mount Hope Church in Lansing: Okay, while nothing too violent appears to have happened during this confrontation, I disapprove of involving children on either side of a radical event. Right or Left. And I'll point out that while we cannot claim that Jesus was homosexual with any definity, he was certainly raised in a homosocial environment. Seriously, look it up. Back to the action According to Bash Back! Lansings ""Points of Unity"", as listed on their MySpace account , all members must agree to: Which, again, why do 'Anarchist' groups have rules, tenets, or manifestoes? Again, why portray this group as 'Anarchists'? They obviously had a plan, brought the press, had two groups in action, one as an ""inside"" team that wore suits and carried bibles and the ""outside"" team who brought in the demonstration gear. They were also wearing Secret Service style earwigs to coordinate the action. Apparently Nathan Harris, a reporter for 'City Pulse', had prior knowledge of the event and was there to document it. But there were no reports made of physical violence, just a disruption of services, a bit of lewdness, passing out of flyers and glitter. Actually something I would have prayed for when I used to have to go to church. However, there was some indecency involved. Some members of the operation held back and reported what their demonstrated had wrought. To which members of Bash Back! Lansing reponded by saying: However, journalist Kyle Bristow points out that: Which is not the point of the story of the moneychangers, but why let reason seep in when it comes to religion and legitimizing your instinct to retaliate. That would be falling into the argument of the Bash Back! organization, legitimizing their claim that Mount Hope Church is bigoted against the LGBT community. Nor was there a need to put in the beating of Matthew Shepard in there. Again, terms like 'Fascism' seem a little heavy handed for what went on and deals more with a econo-political structure, but why worry about words. There is surprising little video out there of this event, just people commenting on it, such as Jason Goldtrap, a novelist in Florida. I will admit that there was more, from what I gather, a paramilitarian aspect of this event, the first group who looked like ""normal"" folk, the second group who were wrapped in pink kuffiyas (a headdress more commonly now associated with terrorists, unfortunately), and a third group who reported back to the main group the after effects of event. Plus the earwings. Seriously, that's organized. Actually, this reminds me more of what William S. Burroughs wrote in The Wild Boys: A Book of the Dead and The Red Night Trilogy. Burroughs claimed that what the GLBT community was not expressing themselves as they really are, but by ""reclaiming"" what is thought to be homosexual is to fall into the trap of accepting the role the heterosexual has already defined for you. I believe I read Bash Back! make a similar claim that the regular GLBT community is simply opting for assimilation, not identity. Hence, Burroughs has never really been given his due as a writer who was writing both as a junkie and a homosexual during the 1950s on. He's usually written out of the gay canon as an oddity whose identity was tainted by a male-dominant role, whereas his novels project an anti-straight and anti-assimilated gay society where wild boys can run free being equal, no dominant/submissive roles, no male/female roles. Just the perfect society before societal rules are assimilated. Happy 200! Hope to hear some response to this. UPDATE: Bash Back!

In The Australian, an old China hand, Dan Ryan, offers his own view of where all this “harmony” is leading: Attempts by the government to try to build its idea of harmony will almost always trend towards restricting freedom of speech or narrowing the parameters of debate. Increasingly governments in the West seem to believe the need to preserve some ill-defined sense of harmony trumps any individual right to forthrightly discuss controversial subject matter. From Ottawa (Mark Steyn), and Vienna (Elisabeth Sabaditsch-Wolff) to Amsterdam (Geerts Wilders) and Melbourne (Andrew Bolt), prominent journalists and politicians are put on trial not because they have breached any traditional, narrowly defined limits on free speech (defamation, incitement to violence, breach of national security) but because they have criticised or drawn unwelcome attention to some important cultural, religious or ethnic problem that should rightfully be subject to debate. In the interests of a specious social “harmony”, the state in Britain, Canada, Australia, and Europe has grown increasingly comfortable with restraining and shriveling core western values: As Anthony Daniels wrote the other day, “Everyone must conform in the name of diversity.“ I used to think the land of the First Amendment would prove immune to this trend. But, given the way every other bad idea from the Rest of the West – multiculturalism, government health care – has taken root here, I’m no longer so sanguine.

Mike Godwin To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. It was back in 1990 that I set out on a project in memetic engineering. The Nazi-comparison meme, I'd decided, had gotten out of hand - in countless Usenet newsgroups, in many conferences on the Well, and on every BBS that I frequented, the labeling of posters or their ideas as ""similar to the Nazis"" or ""Hitler-like"" was a recurrent and often predictable event. It was the kind of thing that made you wonder how debates had ever occurred without having that handy rhetorical hammer. Not everyone saw the comparison to Nazis as a ""meme"" - most people on the Net, as elsewhere, had never heard of ""memes"" or ""memetics."" But now that we're living in an increasingly information-aware culture, it's time for that to change. And it's time for net.dwellers to make a conscious effort to control the kinds of memes they create or circulate. A ""meme,"" of course, is an idea that functions in a mind the same way a gene or virus functions in the body. And an infectious idea (call it a ""viral meme"") may leap from mind to mind, much as viruses leap from body to body. When a meme catches on, it may crystallize whole schools of thought. Take the ""black hole"" meme, for instance. As physicist Brandon Carter has commented in Stephen Hawkings's A Brief History of Time: A Reader's Companion: ""Things changed dramatically when John Wheeler invented the term [black hole]...Everybody adopted it, and from then on, people around the world, in Moscow, in America, in England, and elsewhere, could know they were speaking about the same thing."" Once the ""black hole"" meme became commonplace, it became a handy source of metaphors for everything from illiteracy to the deficit. By 1990, I had noticed, something similar had happened to the Nazi-comparison meme. Sure, there are obvious topics in which the comparison recurs. In discussions about guns and the Second Amendment, for example, gun-control advocates are periodically reminded that Hitler banned personal weapons. And birth-control debates are frequently marked by pro-lifers' insistence that abortionists are engaging in mass murder, worse than that of Nazi death camps. And in any newsgroup in which censorship is discussed, someone inevitably raises the specter of Nazi book-burning. But the Nazi-comparison meme popped up elsewhere as well - in general discussions of law in misc.legal, for example, or in the EFF conference on the Well. Stone libertarians were ready to label any government regulation as incipient Nazism. And, invariably, the comparisons trivialized the horror of the Holocaust and the social pathology of the Nazis. It was a trivialization I found both illogical (Michael Dukakis as a Nazi? Please!) and offensive (the millions of concentration-camp victims did not die to give some net.blowhard a handy trope). So, I set out to conduct an experiment - to build a counter-meme designed to make discussion participants see how they are acting as vectors to a particularly silly and offensive meme...and perhaps to curtail the glib Nazi comparisons. I developed Godwin's Law of Nazi Analogies: As an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches one. I seeded Godwin's Law in any newsgroup or topic where I saw a gratuitous Nazi reference. Soon, to my surprise, other people were citing it - the counter-meme was reproducing on its own! And it mutated like a meme, generating corollaries like the following: In time, discussions in the seeded newsgroups and discussions seemed to show a lower incidence of the Nazi-comparison meme. And the counter-meme mutated into even more useful forms. (As Cuckoo's Egg author Cliff Stoll once said to me: ""Godwin's Law? Isn't that the law that states that once a discussion reaches a comparison to Nazis or Hitler, its usefulness is over?"") By my (admittedly low) standards, the experiment was a success. But its success had given me much to reflect on. If it's possible to generate effective counter-memes, is there any moral imperative to do so? When we see a bad or false meme go by, should we take pains to chase it with a counter-meme? Do we have an obligation to improve our informational environment? Our social environment? But this power to do good may also be a power to do ill. Anyone on the Net has the power to affect stock prices. (Or worse: a fraudulent re-creation of the Tylenol-poisoning scare could cause a national or international panic.) And viral memes are capable of doing lasting damage. While the world of the Net is filled with diverse critical thinkers who are ready to challenge self-indulgent or self-aggrandizing memes, we can't rely on net.culture's diversity and inertia to answer every bad meme. The Nazi-comparison meme has a peculiar resilience, in part because of its sheer inflammatory power (""You're calling me a Nazi? You're the Nazi in this discussion!"") The best way to fight such memes is to craft counter-memes designed to put them in perspective. The time may have come for us to commit ourselves to memetic engineering - crafting good memes to drive out the bad ones. Otherwise, plus ça change, plus c'est la meme chose.

"A new Public Policy Polling survey has just been released, showing that while the six major, potential Republican challengers for Florida’s Senate seat trail incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, the most promising candidate is Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales. Jimmy Wales is, by far, the freshest political name for Florida voters. Only 17% have formed an opinion of Wales as a political candidate, leaving 83% of Floridian voters still available for Wales to win over. Wales, who is still relatively unknown as a political quantity, only trails Nelson by a margin in the teens, the same as his Republican opponents. By contrast: Jimmy Wales greatly outpolls his political ID, implying that once all these candidates are on an equal footing as far as ID goes, Jimmy Wales is the most electable. Here’s how the candidates stack up against one another: This poll shows that a Republican nominee Wales would certainly have the best odds in a general election matchup when the candidates’ political name recognition has saturated all voters. Let Jimmy know how promising his poll numbers are and that you want him to run for US Senate! Was Senator Bill Nelson aware that the lone reporter who was allowed to attend one of his fundraisers, was in fact forced into a closet for over an hour? Even if Nelson was not aware of this horrific treatment by the government of the press, will Nelson speak out against this and denounce this kind of behavior? If this sort of thing doesn’t bother Nelson, it wouldn’t be the first time Nelson has shown appalling disregard for the First Amendment: Bill Nelson is no protector of free speech. Jimmy Wales, however, has built his entire career upon the principle of free speech. His work with Wikipedia and Wikia, Inc. has proven that, by giving everyone a voice, we all benefit immensely. Put Jimmy Wales in the US Senate, and defend your First Amendment rights from power-thirsty statists like Bill Nelson. Bill Nelson voted for the $825 billion, pork-filled stimulus legislation. (Source) Bill Nelson opposes parents choosing schools via vouchers. (Source) Bill Nelson voted against debate over job-killing cap-and-trade legislation. (Source) Bill Nelson voted against property rights, and in favor of eminent domain. (Source) Bill Nelson voted for the failed Cash For Clunkers program. (Source) Bill Nelson supported the First Amendment-restricting McCain-Feingold legislation. (Source) Bill Nelson voted for the Patriot Act, which violates the Fourth Amendment and levies burdensome regulations on American businesses. (Source) Bill Nelson voted to increase the debt by expanding unfunded entitlement programs. (Source) Bill Nelson was one of only three Senators to co-sponsor a horrendous bill that would give Obama unchecked power to shut down Internet traffic. (Source) Bill Nelson voted to raise his own pay (Source), while voting for taxes on the citizens of Florida. (Source) Floridians deserve better. Jimmy Wales will fight for balanced budgets, low taxes, your constitutional rights, your privacy, and your freedom. If you want to help put Jimmy Wales into the Senate in 2012, here’s a few things you can do: The Economy Education Second Amendment State Sovereignty National Defense Jimmy Wales, American Internet entrepreneur and founder of Wikipedia, was born in Huntsville, Alabama. He attended Randolph School, a university-preparatory school, then earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees in finance. While in graduate school, he taught at two universities, but left before completing a Ph.D. in order to take a job in finance and later worked as the research director of a Chicago futures and options firm. In 2001, together with Larry Sanger and others, Wales helped launch Wikipedia, a free, open content encyclopedia that enjoyed rapid growth and popularity, and as Wikipedia’s public profile grew, he became the project’s promoter and spokesman. Wales serves on the Board of Trustees of the Wikimedia Foundation, the non-profit charitable organization he helped establish to operate Wikipedia, holding its board-appointed “community founder” seat. In 2004, he co-founded Wikia, a for-profit wiki-hosting service, of which he was the CEO until 2006. Wales’s work is grounded in the principles of “freedom, liberty, and individual rights,” which are his core principles. Wales, an advocate of free markets and limited government, speaks out often on issues of the day. He has lived in St. Petersburg, Florida since 2002. We support drafting Jimmy Wales for Florida’s next U.S. Senator, because Jimmy understands what it is that makes America great: It is freedom, not government control and regulation, that fuels the spirit of our nation. It is independence, not centralized planning, that ensures this country’s prosperity. It is our respect for human rights, not the pomp of the State, that earns us the reverence and admiration of the world. Jimmy is a true patriot in the mold of Washington and Jefferson, who didn’t seek power for themselves, but liberty for their country. His common sense is desperately needed in the U.S. Senate in these out-of-control times. We call upon Jimmy Wales to become our next U.S. Senator, because no one in the great state of Florida is better positioned than he to run on this platform, and no one can be better trusted than he to truly fight for our freedoms. We are not affiliated with Jimmy Wales, nor do we know how willing he would be to take up this banner on our behalf, but we believe he cares deeply about the state of the country and the world, and that he will carefully consider our call. ""Freedom, liberty, individual rights, that idea of dealing with other people in a manner that is not initiating force against them, is critical to me."""
"Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. Just when you think that our govern ment can’t get any sillier, along comes something like the Military Leadership Diversity Commission — and let’s face it, up to now you didn’t even realize such a thing existed — to crush your hopes that any sensible people are left in Washington, DC. The diversity commission last week issued its completely unawaited report to call for, you guessed it, more diversity among military leadership. Not great fighting effectiveness, which should always be job No. 1. Not smarter leadership. Not braver fighting generals and fewer rear-echelon paper-pushers. No, what this country really needs from the Pentagon is better diversity management, including a chief diversity officer reporting directly to the defense secretary. It seems the problem is — wait for it — that the officer corps has too many white males. This, of course, will come as a shock to George Washington, U.S. Grant, Black Jack Pershing, George Patton and Dwight D. Eisenhower, who somehow managed to struggle through to victory without the accumulated wisdom of the Military Leadership Diversity Commission, created by the Pelosi-Reid Congress in 2009. “The commission believes that the diversity of our service members is the unique strength of our military,” writes the chairman, Lester Lyles, to President Obama, in a cover letter for the report. “Current and future challenges can be better met by broadening our understanding of diversity.” Hold it right there. “The unique strength of our military”? Only in the wonderful world of government PC-speak and corporate sensitivity training is this fantasy not laughed out of the regiment. Our all-volunteer military has many strengths — superior weaponry, better tactics, more education and, since 2001, matchless battlefield and combat experience — but “diversity” shouldn’t rank high among them. Instead, it’s a welcome by-product of recruitment, talent, brains, courage and drive — the things that make American forces the best in the world. In fact, unless the goal of your outfit is nose counting, “diversity” is basically meaningless. The overriding measure for any organization ought to be its effectiveness at getting the job done — and that goes double for an institution designed first and foremost to kill people and blow things up in the defense of freedom, liberty and the USA. In any case, since President Harry Truman integrated the armed forces in 1948 with Executive Order 9981, the US military has been a leader, not a follower when it comes to “inclusion.” In no other area of American life have first the races (and now the sexes) been treated so fairly or performed together more effectively — something that even the diversity commission has to admit: “The commission acknowledges that the services have been leaders in providing opportunities for all service members, regardless of their racial/ethnic background or gender.” But of course that’s not good enough for the nose-counters — not when 77 percent of active-duty senior officers are white, 8 percent black, 5 percent Hispanic and 16 percent are women. “The Armed Forces have not yet succeeded in developing a continuing stream of leaders who are as demographically diverse as the nation they serve.” Yet, according to the 2010 census, whites account for nearly 75 percent of the population, and blacks 12.4 percent, while Latinos can fall into either category. The “problem” seems minor. Among other things, the commission recommends that since combat is often a ticket to promotion, we need women in combat units, where they can have the same opportunity as a man either to be promoted — or be killed. But combat effectiveness is not what this report is all about. Instead, it gives the game away right at the beginning: Its first injunction is that we must “Define Diversity for a New Era.” Everything that comes after is seen through this myopic, PC prism. Fortunately, at least one man in Washington knows how to spell bunkum: Lt. Col. Allen West, now a congressman from Florida, who called the report a “slap in the face” to those minorities who have forged successful careers in the services without the help of diversity commissions. The outspoken colonel, whose political career is poised for takeoff, is absolutely right. The president and the Pentagon should thank the commission for its work, put the report in the trash and get on with the dirty business of fighting — and winning — the nation’s diverse wars. Michael Walsh, a former associate editor of Time, is the author (writing as “David Ka hane”) of “Rules for Radical Conservatives.” Share Selection"
"Over the last two years, and perhaps especially over the last few weeks, we’ve discussed the lack of leadership demonstrated by Barack Obama in his presidency. He declined to lead on Porkulus and ObamaCare, pushing off the actual writing and selling mainly to Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid on both bills. Obama didn’t bother to demand a budget from his own party leadership while they controlled Congress, and now he’s been mainly AWOL now that Republicans have control of the House, except to falsely claim that Democrats have met Republicans “halfway” on budget cuts. Even his official envoy to the budget talks, Joe Biden, took a powder after a single meeting. The Associated Press reports today that this is no accident, but an “above the fray strategy“: Call it an above-the-fray strategy. On hot issues that Democrats and Republicans have found cause to fret about — from spending reductions to state labor disputes — President Barack Obama is keeping a low profile. Dan Pfeiffer, the White House communications director, says that the low profile is a deliberate choice: Pfeiffer said Obama has enough issues on his agenda and said the White House doesn’t believe the public wants the president weighing in on an array of subjects. “They want him leading the country; they don’t want him serving as a cable commentator for the issue of the day,” he said. But a Super Bowl interview is OK? Er … sure. On some issues, Pfeiffer is right. For instance, Obama didn’t have any business weighing in on a state budget debate in Wisconsin. The above-the-fray strategy appeared to make an exception for this case, though, as Obama didn’t miss an opportunity early on to claim that Scott Walker’s bill “seems like more of an assault on unions.” He also used a meeting with governors to scold Walker (without naming him) for vilifying public employees. However, despite promising to do so during the campaign, Obama has yet to put on “comfortable shoes” and demonstrate with the unions against the bill. On other issues, though, a President has plenty of opportunity for leadership. That is certainly true for issues with the federal budget, which Obama must sign in order to pass into law. In fact, Presidents supply the unofficial start of the budgeting process by submitting their budget requests to Congress, where the House generates the official budget proposal. People expect the chief executive to remain engaged in the process, at least with Congress, even if they don’t want the President on cable-news shows. Both Democrats and Republicans have complained loudly over the last few weeks that Obama is nowhere to be found except in occasional news appearances when it comes to budget negotiations. In foreign affairs, Americans expect their President not just to lead the debate here in the US but around the world. Congress can advise on foreign affairs, but the executive has all of the authority to negotiate American interests abroad. Maintaining a “low profile” and ceding influence to France is not exactly what Americans consider leadership on the world stage, a role we expect our Presidents to assume. The “above-the-fray strategy” argument is weak cover for an “over-his-head” President. "
"At Friday's news conference, President Obama tried to connect with the common man coping with rising gasoline prices. Instead, the president left little doubt that he is clueless about cars. ""You may want to buy a fuel-efficient car,"" quoth Obama, ""but you may not be able to afford it. And so you're stuck with the old clunker that's getting 8 or 10 miles a gallon."" Eight to 10 mpg? Which clunker would that be? I wondered. An old Hummer? Your father's father's Oldsmobile? A late-model Lamborghini? It takes a luxury brand, a boat-sized machine and/or a few decades to approach those dismal mileage numbers. An 11-year-old Pontiac minivan, for example, gets 17 mpg in the city, 24 mpg on the highway. You have to go back to the Carter administration years or earlier to find Obama's idea of a gas-guzzling family car - and even that vehicle would have been a van, light truck/SUV or luxury model. And yet he is behind the wheel of Washington's energy policy. Can you blame me for believing Team Obama was pushing the pedal to the metal in a rush for higher gas prices? On Friday, Obamaland pushed back against the perception that its anti-drilling policies - implemented in the wake of the April 2010 BP Deepwater Horizon blowout - have contributed to high prices at the pump. The cost of filling one's gas tank has risen uncomfortably close to $4 per gallon in the Bay Area. The administration rightly notes that domestic oil and natural gas production have increased since 2008, while imports have decreased. OK, but: Erik Milito of the American Petroleum Institute told Environment and Energy Publishing, ""The increased production levels in 2010 are a credit to the vision of previous administrations."" Milito credited the 1995 Deepwater Royalty Relief Act signed by Bill Clinton and passed by a GOP-controlled Congress. To his credit, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar had supported offshore oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. But after an oil platform explosion left 11 workers dead and coated beaches with oil, he reacted. Then Salazar over-reacted. Democrats like Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana saw their home states suffer first from the oil spill, and then the oil-job shutoff. Landrieu came to vigorously oppose what had evolved into a de facto moratorium on drilling permits. Clinton himself lamented ""ridiculous delays in permitting when our economy doesn't need it."" The administration didn't issue a permit since the blowout until this month - and then only after a federal judge's prompting. Not to mention the steady job-killing creep of climbing gasoline prices. There always has been a corner of Obamaland that doesn't appreciate the job-creating properties of cheap fuel. Now Energy Secretary Steven Chu told the Wall Street Journal, ""Somehow we have to figure out how to boost the price of gasoline to the levels in Europe."" Chu said that in September 2008 - and still Obama picked him for the slot. Then again, if you think there are a lot of Americans cruising Main Street in gas-guzzling monstrosities, you probably wouldn't even notice the high price of gasoline - until your approval ratings started to approach, well, Jimmy Carter levels.

"Link copied. We want to bridge divides to reach everyone. Republican freshmen revolt, saying the three-week spending bill cuts too little – $6 billion – from the 2011 budget. House Democrats who backed the measure say the GOP rift gives them an edge. Loading... March 15, 2011 In a dramatic House vote, 54 Republicans broke ranks with their own leadership Tuesday to oppose a three-week stopgap measure to keep government funded beyond March 18, when the current continuing resolution expires. The spending bill, which passed 271 to 178, cuts $6 billion from fiscal year 2010 spending levels. It now heads to the Senate, where the Democratic majority leader promises action this week. The rift in Republican ranks caps a week of high frustration in which neither the Senate nor the White House brought a plan to the table that makes a dent in a projected $1.65 trillion deficit for the 2011 fiscal year, which ends Oct. 1. Conservatives, including many in the 87-member GOP freshman class, say the time for a showdown with Democrats – and with their own leadership – over the need for significant budget cuts is now. “We’re spending $45 billion a day, what’s $6 billion in cuts?” says freshman Rep. Allen West (R) of Florida, who voted to oppose the bill. “I voted for the last CR – that’s it for me.” Bowing to conservative pressure, especially from the GOP freshmen, House Republicans in February passed a spending bill to fund government through the end of FY 2011 that cut $62 billion from 2010 spending levels. In response, last week, the Senate took back-to-back votes on the House bill and an alternative proposed by the Senate Appropriations panel that cut only $6 billion, mainly comprising programs that were already slated to be scrapped by President Obama. Both measures failed, forcing House Republicans to scramble for another short-term fix. The latest House continuing resolution cuts or eliminates 25 programs, many already identified for elimination by the White House in its budget for FY 2012. In addition to $3.5 billion in program cuts, the House plan also zeros out $2.6 billion for member projects or earmarks. It cuts in three weeks what Senate Democrats proposed cutting over six months. The current two-week continuing resolution cut $4 billion from 2010 levels. “Enactment of this short-term measure would mean $10 billion in cuts in just five weeks, which is $10 billion more than the Democrats who run Washington originally suggested,” said Speaker John Boehner (R) of Ohio, in a statement after the vote. “But if we’re serious about ending uncertainty for small businesses and helping them get back to creating jobs, we need to cut a lot more.” But from now on out, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle say that those cuts get harder. Democrats predict that Tuesday’s vote will mark high-water mark for the new majority. “This would not have passed if Democrats had not helped,” said Rep. Steny Hoyer (D) of Maryland, the minority whip, after the Tuesday vote. Eighty-five Democrats voted with most Republicans to pass the bill. With GOP votes alone, Republicans would have fallen 32 votes short of a majority. The rift signaled in Tuesday’s vote could give Democrats an edge in negotiations with the GOP majority that they did not have before by presenting themselves as more agreeable partners on future spending bills. “They had 54 people that couldn’t vote for this bill – that number only grows,” says Rep. Robert Andrews (D) of New Jersey, a member of the House Budget Committee. A top priority of Democrats will be to protect education spending, he adds. “Anything to do with the repeal of health care or funding of Planned Parenthood also can’t be part of the deal,” he added. On the other hand, House GOP leaders could opt to shift toward their tea party freshmen, and try to muscle a bill through on the strength of their own majority – risking a government shutdown. ""In the short run, maybe Democrats can get away without putting anything on the table,"" says Michael Franc, vice president for government affairs at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. ""But if this is the high-water mark for spending cuts in a $1.6 trillion deficit environment, that should be a clarion call for 2012."" Already a subscriber?

"Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., has once again earned his nickname: Thurston B. Howell III. He's elite, effete and so hopelessly out of touch with reality that his latest solution to America's fiscal profligacy is ... more fiscal profligacy, of course, Lovey! On Tuesday, Kerry introduced a $10 billion infrastructure bank bill that would engineer yet another federal taxpayer boondoggle benefiting Big Labor and favored Big Business interests. Kerry finagled support from Texas GOP Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, AFL-CIO brass knuckler-in-chief Richard Trumka, statist U.S. Chamber of Commerce head Tom Donohue, and the far-left Center for American Progress. Like spinning straw into gold, the Kerry coalition promises to leverage $10 billion in unidentified funds into $640 billion for crumbling roads and bridges. This new recipe for expansive government is actually not a ""new"" idea. It's an old recycled one borrowed from former corruptocrat Democratic Sen. Chris Dodd, who sponsored a bill to create a federally operated ""infrastructure bank"" in 2007. President Obama tried to get $5 billion in funding for one in his 2010 budget, and $4 billion is proposed for one in his 2011 budget. Connecticut Democratic Rep. Rosa DeLauro is pushing a House version -- and her lavish pipe-dream plans tell you all you need to know about what a disastrous, costly slush fund this thing would inevitably morph into (TARP redux plus stimulus redux plus Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac redux = abysmal failure redux): ""The program, which would make loans much like the World Bank, would finance projects with the potential to transform whole regions, or even the national economy, the way the interstate highway system and the first transcontinental railway once did,"" The New York Times reported last fall. ""In an interview, Ms. DeLauro said she would be 'looking at a broader base,' meaning the bank would finance not just roads and rails, but also telecommunications, water, drainage, green energy and other large-scale works."" Green energy? Bright red flag. Like Stimulus I, which was initially intended to put infrastructure spending first but evolved into a multipurpose slush fund that put infrastructure last, the Kerry-Dodd-DeLauro-Obama ""infrastructure bank"" envisioned by progressives on Capitol Hill would be plundered to finance ""green energy"" and ""other large-scale works"" based on ""social benefits"" determined by a panel of cronies appointed by the president. The social justice infrastructure ""bank"" would be anything but a bank in the normal sense of the word. Ron Utt at the Washington-based Heritage Foundation exposed the farce: ""This bank would be capitalized by federal appropriations to leverage a greater volume of debt borrowed under the full faith and credit of the federal government. In turn the bank would use these funds to finance eligible infrastructure projects. While these proposed entities -- and similar ones that exist in the states from earlier legislation -- are described as 'banks,' they are no such thing."" In other words: The infrastructure banks would borrow more money the government doesn't have to dole out grants that wouldn't be paid back and don't require interest payments. All's well that ends well in the land of make-believe austerity. Unsurprisingly, Big Labor biggie Andy Stern, former head of the Service Employees International Union and an Obama confidante, is glomming on to the infrastructure bank idea to push a new overseas profit tax on multinational corporations. Brilliant: Impose new double-taxes on American businesses that no other country imposes, reduce competitiveness, induce companies to incorporate outside the U.S., and then put union bosses in charge of redistributing the $30 billion punitive windfall. Supporters also compare the infrastructure bank plan to the U.S. Export-Import Bank -- an idea that, as Washington Examiner reporter Tim Carney rightly notes, ""epitomizes corporate welfare. It also is a prime example of unaccountability. The agency is independent of any cabinet department, and it hands out loans and loan guarantees basically at its own discretion. ... (I)t's kind of like Fannie Mae was, before its exposure became real and the taxpayers had to come in and bail it out. So, Kerry wants to create Fannie Pave, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce loves the idea: a bunch of free money that seems to cost nothing."" Who pays? Ordinary taxpayers, nonunion contractors and businesses that don't pander to the Obama White House. Remember: In his first weeks in office, Obama signed union-friendly executive order 13502, which essentially forces contractors who bid on large-scale public construction projects worth $25 million or more to submit to union representation for their employees. The project labor agreement racket requires contractors to hand over exclusive bargaining control; to pay inflated, above-market wages and benefits; and to fork over dues money and pension funding to corrupt, cash-starved labor organizations. Higher taxes. Union favoritism. Crony capitalism. Left-wing special interest wish list. We're on the road to another irreparable taxpayer sinkhole.

"The Arizona Republic reports ‘Atheist group sues governor over prayer day‘: Gov. Jan Brewer is being sued for issuing proclamations in support of an Arizona Day of Prayer. The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in federal court, alleges that Brewer’s actions were unconstitutional because they violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, which prohibits Congress from establishing a state religion. The lawsuit seeks an injunction preventing the governor from issuing similar proclamations in the future. Excuse me? Brewer‘s actions were unconstitutional because they violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, which prohibits Congress from establishing a state religion. For those who don’t know, Arizona’s Governor is not the United States Congress. So there is no way she can be violating the First Amendment, which states: Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. It doesn’t take a constitutional law scholar to be able to read the First Amendment and know who it is restricting. But you do have to be literate. Hi there. First time on your site. Yes, Governors don’t have the power to make law. Only Congress holds that power. (Hence their name as the legislative branch.) And therefore, I do not see how the governor can be successfully sued, seeing as how, as you point out, she is doing nothing but supporting such a day. On the other hand, for anyone who supports the constitution, as I do, it is disturbing to see any publicly elected official, let alone one as important as the governor, support something unconstitutional. She may not be violating the constitution, but she is encouraging the congress to violate the constitution. Can she be sued for it? Don’t know, but I’d guess not. I can understand, though, why citizens might be concerned when the state’s biggest leader puts her agenda over the nation’s laws. As a citizen, I’m more concerned over a multi-trillion$ national debt than a day of prayer in the desert. I am too. But at this point, maybe only God can save us now.

"If you can’t beat ’em … fake ’em out? Two Democratic Party leaders in Michigan face nine felony counts after prosecutors allege that they forged documents to put fake Tea Party candidates on the ballot. Unlike other schemes where Democrats allegedly recruited candidates to run on ersatz Tea Party organization identities, these “candidates” had no idea they were on the ballot at all, some of them only discovering it after receiving delinquency notices on filings. Fox News in Detroit reports that the grand jury is still probing the matter and that there may be more indictments coming: Two Charged in Tea Party Election Fraud: MyFoxDETROIT.com Two former leaders of the Oakland County Democratic Party are facing a total of nine felonies for allegedly forging election paperwork to get fake Tea Party candidates on November’s ballot. … Former Oakland County Democratic Chair Mike McGuinness and former Democratic Operations Director Jason Bauer face up to 14 years in prison if convicted. “Some of the people didn’t even know they were on the ballot till they began receiving delinquency notices of filings that were required as a candidate,” said Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard. The sheriff says 23 statewide races had questionable Tea Party candidates on the ballot and the investigation may go beyond Oakland County. The charges involve forgery, fraud, and perjury. The prosecution alleges that the two signed candidacy materials under false pretenses, forms which require people to acknowledge that they are under oath to provide truthful and accurate information. If they signed the forms themselves under the names of people who didn’t know what the two Democrats were doing, those charges should be easy to prove in court. The two will face years in prison. The question will be whether this was part of a larger operation to dilute the ballot to help Democrats, a scheme that failed anyway. If McGuiness and Bauer end up facing the long end of a 14-year sentence, they may be highly motivated to tell prosecutors about any wider plans in Michigan to defraud voters. Fox notes that the grand jury continues to probe this even after the indictments against the two Oakland County Democratic Party leaders, which might mean more indictments will be forthcoming. We will definitely keep an eye out for further developments. "
"Sign In 'Sheriff' lobbied for Amtrak funding Manage Newsletters Shameless politicians use 9/11 to lecture America about “unity” Biden’s forced COVID-19 vaccine attack on minorities Dems’ totalitarian overreach threatens Americans’ livelihood As a thank-you to its most famous customer, Amtrak is renaming the train station in Wilmington, Del., after stimulus “sheriff” Vice President Joseph R. Biden — after the project received $20 million in stimulus money and came in $5.7 million over the initial announced budget. Spokesmen for Mr. Biden, who said he personally fought for stimulus money for Amtrak, didn’t respond to messages Wednesday or Thursday. But Amtrak said it alone made the decision to rename the station in honor of the vice president. The company also said its own budget projection was always greater than the $32 million the White House announced back in 2009 — though Amtrak itself also listed the $32 million cost that year, later raising the price tag to $37.7 million. TOP STORIES Republican points to 'leaked' Biden call, accuses administration of 'manipulating' Taliban intel 'No SALT, no deal': Vulnerable Dems threaten revolt unless $3.5T bill cuts blue-states taxes CNN poll: America turns irate, glum “The Wilmington station is owned by Amtrak, and Amtrak on its own made the determination to name the station,” said spokeswoman Danelle Hunter. President Obama, soon after signing the Recovery Act in early 2009, designated Mr. Biden his “sheriff” overseeing the stimulus funds, charging him with regularly checking in with governors and mayors to try to prevent waste, fraud and abuse in the $821 billion economic recovery package. In that role, Mr. Biden himself traveled to Wilmington on May 4, 2009, to announce the $20 million in stimulus money as part of what the White House billed a “$32 million renovation and restoration” of the century-old station. “We would not be spending a penny on it today without the Recovery Act,” Mr. Biden said. “We have no time to wait. We cannot wait. That’s what the Recovery Act is about.” The vice president, who as a senator commuted daily by train from his home in Delaware to Washington, bragged he had made more than 7,000 round trips on the track. He said he “heavily influenced the amount of money” that Amtrak received under the stimulus. Renaming the station is apparently legal — and is fitting in this case, said Leslie Paige, spokeswoman for Citizens Against Government Waste. “It’s an absolutely perfect monument to a guy whose entire history has been overspending and overpromising,” she said. “It would make sense [Mr. Biden’s] name would be slapped on a bloated, over-budget train station in Wilmington.” After more than 18 months of work, the station reopened in December with newly renovated real and faux-marble floors, a new heating and air-conditioning system, and free wireless Internet installed throughout. The renovation also improved the track’s waterproofing and reworked the station’s plumbing. But the cost figures for the refurbishing project remain murky. Not only did the White House cite the projected cost at $32 million, but Amtrak used that figure in a 2009 press release documenting its Delaware projects. But Ms. Hunter, the Amtrak spokeswoman, said the company’s original budget for the renovation was actually $35.7 million: with $20 million from stimulus money; $12 million from Delaware’s Department of Transportation; and $3.7 million from Amtrak itself. Ms. Hunter said the final cost reached $37.7 million when Amtrak added $2 million worth of work that was not part of the original scope of the project. In its official Recovery Act report, Amtrak gave a different figure altogether — $36 million to the dollar — for the refurbishing project. And it said the breakdown in funding was $20 million in stimulus funds and $4 million from a 2009 federal grant, in addition to the $12 million from Delaware DOT. A Delaware DOT spokesman confirmed the stated $12 million, but referred other calls to Amtrak, which he said headed up the project. In its latest reporting, Amtrak said the Wilmington project supported 176 full-time jobs in the quarter running from October through December. All told, Delaware got more than $126 million in stimulus funds targeted for Amtrak, or nearly 10 percent of the $1.3 billion Amtrak received from Mr. Obama’s program. Amtrak said the Wilmington station is the 12th-busiest one in its system, serving nearly 700,000 passengers in 2010. "
"© 1998-2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All Rights Reserved Establishing and taking control of the skies over Libya could cost the Pentagon up to $300 million a week – or around $15 billion a year – under mission scenarios formulated by a top Washington defense think tank. Lawmakers have pressed the White House to consider a no-fly zone, but Pentagon officials have been mum about specific options under consideration. As such, the report from the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments shines a light on the Pentagon’s thinking. While several lawmakers have suggested it would not be difficult to set up the no-fly zone, the report suggests it would be expensive and complicated. It presents three options for a no-fly zone: One that covers the entire nation; a “limited” plan covering the northern third of Libya; and a third focused only on coastal areas. The full-coverage plan would account for all of Libya’s 680,000 square miles and be the most operationally complex – and the most expensive. “Assuming an operational tempo similar to that of the no-fly zones in Iraq, the ongoing cost might be in the range of $100 [million] to $300 million per week,” states the report. The full option would require taking out Libyan air defense systems in what the think tank says would be a “series of coordinated strikes” at a “one-time ... cost between $500 million and $1 billion.” The northern option would put U.S. aircraft in control of all Libyan turf above the 29th parallel, which includes about 230,000 square miles, according to CSBA. The cost of this kind of mission would fall between $30 million and $100 million per week. A northern no-fly would also require the U.S. military to deal with Libyan air defense systems, meaning it would still come with a one-time bill of between $400 million and $800 million, CSBA said. Sen. Joseph Lieberman (I-Conn.) last week suggested setting up a no-fly zone would not be difficult, saying Libyan air bases are located “on one strip of land ... along the north coast.” Lieberman is the chairman of the Senate Armed Services AirLand subcommittee. Sen. John McCainJohn Sidney McCain20 years after 9/11, US foreign policy still struggles for balance What the chaos in Afghanistan can remind us about the importance of protecting democracy at home 'The View' plans series of conservative women as temporary McCain replacements MORE (R-Ariz.), ranking member of the full Armed Services panel, said Libyan air assets operate out of only four bases in that area. He called the Libyan regime’s air defense systems “Soviet-style” and “modest,” an opinion echoed by Lieberman. The duo has been among the most vocal U.S. lawmakers in calling for the U.S. to set up a no-fly zone. These hawks say the administration has been too slow to answer Libyan strikes on rebel forces. President Obama and the Pentagon have appeared to resist those entreaties, with military leaders highlighting the air strikes and costs necessary to set up a no-fly zone. The White House is reportedly concerned that U.S. military involvement could undermine the revolt by bringing in a Western presence. Deputy Defense Secretary William Lynn on Thursday told the Senate Budget Committee he could not yet provide a no-fly zone cost projection because defense officials are still mulling mission options. The third option presented by CSBA would primarily rely on missile-armed U.S. ships positioned off Libya’s northern coast and land-based fighter aircraft. “Ship-based Aegis radars and land-based AWACS aircraft could identify and track hostile aircraft at long range,” CSBA said. “Aircraft violating the no-fly zone could be intercepted using ship-based SM-2 surface-to-air missiles or land-based fighter aircraft armed with beyond-visual-range AIM-120 air-to-air missiles.” This version of the mission would cost $15 million to $25 million per week, but there would be no one-time bill from engaging Libyan air defenses because those assets would not have to be destroyed, according to the report. CSBA used data culled from similar U.S. operations in Yugoslavia and Iraq to arrive at its estimates for the first two options. The third option differs from those past operations, so the defense scholars based their projection on the cost of operating various military platforms and the cost of certain munitions. Secretary of State Hillary ClintonHillary Diane Rodham ClintonSchumer remembers 9/11: 'Oh my God, this is World War III' Bidens, former presidents mark 9/11 anniversary Why is Biden hesitating to challenge China as East Asia's major trade partner? MORE told a congressional panel last week that the Iraqi no-fly zones – which were in place for several years – did not force out Saddam Hussein. Defense Secretary Robert Gates, speaking at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium on March 10, said the transatlantic military alliance would only launch operations in Libya “if there is demonstrable need, a sound legal basis and strong regional support.” The CSBA report was prepared by the center’s Todd Harrison and Zack Cooper. The think tank has ties to the Pentagon. Its president, Andrew Krepinevich, is a member of the Pentagon's influential Defense Policy Board, which reports directly to the defense secretary. Michael Vickers, the administration’s nominee to be the next under secretary of intelligence and a current assistant secretary of defense, worked at the think tank before joining the Pentagon in 2007.

Sign up for Africa Brief By signing up, I agree to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use and to occasionally receive special offers from Foreign Policy. At the start of this week, the consensus around Washington was that military action against Libya was not in the cards. However, in the last several days, the White House completely altered its stance and successfully pushed for the authorization for military intervention against Libyan leader Col. Muammar al-Qaddafi. What changed? The key decision was made by President Barack Obama himself at a Tuesday evening senior-level meeting at the White House, which was described by two administration officials as ""extremely contentious."" Inside that meeting, officials presented arguments both for and against attacking Libya. Obama ultimately sided with the interventionists. His overall thinking was described to a group of experts who had been called to the White House to discuss the crisis in Libya only days earlier. ""This is the greatest opportunity to realign our interests and our values,"" a senior administration official said at the meeting, telling the experts this sentence came from Obama himself. The president was referring to the broader change going on in the Middle East and the need to rebalance U.S. foreign policy toward a greater focus on democracy and human rights. But Obama’s stance in Libya differs significantly from his strategy regarding the other Arab revolutions. In Egypt and Tunisia, Obama chose to rebalance the American stance gradually backing away from support for President Hosni Mubarak and Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali and allowing the popular movements to run their course. In Yemen and Bahrain, where the uprisings have turned violent, Obama has not even uttered a word in support of armed intervention – instead pressing those regimes to embrace reform on their own. But in deciding to attack Libya, Obama has charted an entirely new strategy, relying on U.S. hard power and the use of force to influence the outcome of Arab events. ""In the case of Libya, they just threw out their playbook,"" said Steve Clemons, the foreign policy chief at the New America Foundation. ""The fact that Obama pivoted on a dime shows that the White House is flying without a strategy and that we have a reactive presidency right now and not a strategic one."" Inside the administration, senior officials were lined up on both sides. Pushing for military intervention was a group of NSC staffers including Samantha Power, NSC senior director for multilateral engagement; Gayle Smith, NSC senior director for global development; and Mike McFaul, NSC senior director for Russia. . On the other side of the ledger were some Obama administration officials who were reportedly wary of the second- and third-degree effects of committing to a lengthy military mission in Libya. These officials included National Security Advisor Tom Donilon and Deputy National Security Advisor Denis McDonough. Defense Secretary Robert Gates was also opposed to attacking Libya and had said as much in several public statements. Not all of these officials were in Tuesday night’s meeting. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called into the meeting over the phone, a State Department official confirmed. She was traveling in the region to get a first-hand look at how the new U.S. Middle East strategy is being received across the Arab world. Denied a visit with Egyptian youth leaders on the same day she strolled through Tahir Square, Clinton may have been concerned that the United States was losing the battle for the hearts and minds of the Arab youth at the heart of the revolution. When Clinton met with the G8 foreign ministers on Monday, she didn’t lay out whether the United States had a favored response to the unfolding crisis in Libya, leaving her European counterparts completely puzzled. She met Libyan opposition leader Mahmoud Jibril in Paris but declined to respond positively to his request for assistance. This all gave the impression that Clinton was resisting intervention. In fact, she supported intervention, State Department official said, but had to wait until the Tuesday night meeting so that she didn’t get out ahead of U.S. policy. At the end of the Tuesday night meeting, Obama gave U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice instructions to go the U.N. Security Council and push for a resolution that would give the international community authority to use force. Her instructions were to get a resolution that would give the international community broad authority to achieve Qaddafi’s removal, including the use of force beyond the imposition of a no-fly zone. Speaking before the U.N. Security Council following Thursday’s 10-0 vote, Rice made the humanitarian argument that force was needed in Libya to prevent civilian suffering. ""Colonel Qaddafi and those who still stand by him continue to grossly and systematically abuse the most fundamental human rights of Libya’s people,"" Rice said. ""On March 12, the League of Arab States called on the Security Council to establish a no-fly zone and take other measures to protect civilians. Today’s resolution is a powerful response to that call-and to the urgent needs on the ground."" U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon also said on Thursday that the justification for the use of force was based on humanitarian grounds, and referred to the principle known as Responsibility to Protect (R2P), ""a new international security and human rights norm to address the international community’s failure to prevent and stop genocides, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity."" ""Resolution 1973 affirms, clearly and unequivocally, the international community’s determination to fulfill its responsibility to protect civilians from violence perpetrated upon them by their own government,"" he said. Inside the NSC, Power, Smith, and McFaul have been trying to figure out how the administration could implement R2P and what doing so would require of the White House going forward. Donilon and McDonough are charged with keeping America’s core national interests more in mind. Obama ultimately sided with Clinton and those pushing R2P — over the objections of Donilon and Gates. Congress was not broadly consulted on the decision to intervene in Libya, except in a Thursday afternoon classified briefing where administration officials explained the diplomatic and military plan. Rice was already deep in negotiations in New York. Obama’s Tuesday night decision to push for armed intervention was not only a defining moment in his ever-evolving foreign policy, but also may have marked the end of the alliance between Clinton and Gates — an alliance that has successfully influenced administration foreign policy decisions dating back to the 2009 Afghanistan strategy review. ""Gates is clearly not on board with what’s going on and now the Defense Department may have an entirely another war on its hands that he’s not into,"" said Clemons. ""Clinton won the bureaucratic battle to use DOD resources to achieve what’s essentially the State Department’s objective… and Obama let it happen."" UPDATE: A previous version of this story stated that Vice President Joseph Biden pushed for the imposition of a no fly zone in Libya. Friday afternoon, a senior White House official told The Cable that, in fact, Biden shared the same concerns of Gates, Donilon and McDonough and that those concerns have been addressed by the policy announced by the president. At the start of this week, the consensus around Washington was that military action against Libya was not in the cards. However, in the last several days, the White House completely altered its stance and successfully pushed for the authorization for military intervention against Libyan leader Col. Muammar al-Qaddafi.

The president was referring to the broader change going on in the Middle East and the need to rebalance U.S. foreign policy toward a greater focus on democracy and human rights. But Obama’s stance in Libya differs significantly from his strategy regarding the other Arab revolutions. In Egypt and Tunisia, Obama chose to rebalance the American stance gradually backing away from support for President Hosni Mubarak and Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali and allowing the popular movements to run their course. In Yemen and Bahrain, where the uprisings have turned violent, Obama has not even uttered a word in support of armed intervention – instead pressing those regimes to embrace reform on their own. But in deciding to attack Libya, Obama has charted an entirely new strategy, relying on U.S. hard power and the use of force to influence the outcome of Arab events. ""In the case of Libya, they just threw out their playbook,"" said Steve Clemons, the foreign policy chief at the New America Foundation. ""The fact that Obama pivoted on a dime shows that the White House is flying without a strategy and that we have a reactive presidency right now and not a strategic one."" Inside the administration, senior officials were lined up on both sides. Pushing for military intervention was a group of NSC staffers including Samantha Power, NSC senior director for multilateral engagement; Gayle Smith, NSC senior director for global development; and Mike McFaul, NSC senior director for Russia. . On the other side of the ledger were some Obama administration officials who were reportedly wary of the second- and third-degree effects of committing to a lengthy military mission in Libya. These officials included National Security Advisor Tom Donilon and Deputy National Security Advisor Denis McDonough. Defense Secretary Robert Gates was also opposed to attacking Libya and had said as much in several public statements. Not all of these officials were in Tuesday night’s meeting. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called into the meeting over the phone, a State Department official confirmed. She was traveling in the region to get a first-hand look at how the new U.S. Middle East strategy is being received across the Arab world. Denied a visit with Egyptian youth leaders on the same day she strolled through Tahir Square, Clinton may have been concerned that the United States was losing the battle for the hearts and minds of the Arab youth at the heart of the revolution. When Clinton met with the G8 foreign ministers on Monday, she didn’t lay out whether the United States had a favored response to the unfolding crisis in Libya, leaving her European counterparts completely puzzled. She met Libyan opposition leader Mahmoud Jibril in Paris but declined to respond positively to his request for assistance. This all gave the impression that Clinton was resisting intervention. In fact, she supported intervention, State Department official said, but had to wait until the Tuesday night meeting so that she didn’t get out ahead of U.S. policy. At the end of the Tuesday night meeting, Obama gave U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice instructions to go the U.N. Security Council and push for a resolution that would give the international community authority to use force. Her instructions were to get a resolution that would give the international community broad authority to achieve Qaddafi’s removal, including the use of force beyond the imposition of a no-fly zone. Speaking before the U.N. Security Council following Thursday’s 10-0 vote, Rice made the humanitarian argument that force was needed in Libya to prevent civilian suffering. ""Colonel Qaddafi and those who still stand by him continue to grossly and systematically abuse the most fundamental human rights of Libya’s people,"" Rice said. ""On March 12, the League of Arab States called on the Security Council to establish a no-fly zone and take other measures to protect civilians. Today’s resolution is a powerful response to that call-and to the urgent needs on the ground."" U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon also said on Thursday that the justification for the use of force was based on humanitarian grounds, and referred to the principle known as Responsibility to Protect (R2P), ""a new international security and human rights norm to address the international community’s failure to prevent and stop genocides, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity."" ""Resolution 1973 affirms, clearly and unequivocally, the international community’s determination to fulfill its responsibility to protect civilians from violence perpetrated upon them by their own government,"" he said. Inside the NSC, Power, Smith, and McFaul have been trying to figure out how the administration could implement R2P and what doing so would require of the White House going forward. Donilon and McDonough are charged with keeping America’s core national interests more in mind. Obama ultimately sided with Clinton and those pushing R2P — over the objections of Donilon and Gates. Congress was not broadly consulted on the decision to intervene in Libya, except in a Thursday afternoon classified briefing where administration officials explained the diplomatic and military plan. Rice was already deep in negotiations in New York. Obama’s Tuesday night decision to push for armed intervention was not only a defining moment in his ever-evolving foreign policy, but also may have marked the end of the alliance between Clinton and Gates — an alliance that has successfully influenced administration foreign policy decisions dating back to the 2009 Afghanistan strategy review. ""Gates is clearly not on board with what’s going on and now the Defense Department may have an entirely another war on its hands that he’s not into,"" said Clemons. ""Clinton won the bureaucratic battle to use DOD resources to achieve what’s essentially the State Department’s objective… and Obama let it happen."" UPDATE: A previous version of this story stated that Vice President Joseph Biden pushed for the imposition of a no fly zone in Libya. Friday afternoon, a senior White House official told The Cable that, in fact, Biden shared the same concerns of Gates, Donilon and McDonough and that those concerns have been addressed by the policy announced by the president.

"Utah has become the first US state to designate an official state firearm. The Browning M1911 joins the state fossil (allosaurus), fruit (cherry), gem (topaz), bird (sea gull) and other symbols with official designation. The gun was designed by Utah native John Browning. The law's sponsor said it symbolised freedom and empowerment. Opponents said it was inappropriate to glorify a firearm, citing the January mass shooting at a congresswoman's constituent event in nearby Arizona. The .45-calibre semi-automatic pistol was designed by Browning, who was born in Utah in 1855, to fill the US military's need for a pistol with stopping power - the ability to fell an enemy with a single shot. It was adopted by the US Army in 1911, and first saw action in combat with Mexican rebel leader Pancho Villa in 1916, according to the Browning Arms Company. It was later used in World War I and beyond. Democratic Utah State Representative Brian King opposed the bill. ""When we are talking about a state symbol we would do well to come up with one that is more unifying than divisive and this is a very divisive symbol for obvious reasons,"" he told Reuters. ""This is just a poor choice for a state symbol."" UK, US and Australia launch pact to counter China The partnership will enable Australia to build nuclear-powered submarines for the first time.

"d level the charge of racism against opponents because it enhances their power, according to Innis. “The Marxists are guilty of the charge they often level against capitalists, pro-free market economies and countries, which is divide and conquer,” Innis says. “They are the dividers because through their philosophy and rhetoric they seek to segregate a particular group … and certainly throughout the 20th century, in our country, it was the African-Americans. “The communists … took a movement that had its roots in pro-free market, free labor … capitalism and totally corrupted it and co-opted it into a communist agenda.” Innis contends black Americans will find a way out of their current predicament by returning to the individualistic, pro-free market spirit of self-determination exemplified by abolitionists like Frederick Douglass and non-Marxist black intellectuals like Booker T.

Jackson Sr., a prominent conservative black minister and Tea Partier. “This mindset that you are owed something and everything has to be the same for everybody is a very dangerous and insidious attitude that has crept into the black community.” Barack Obama’s 1995 book “Dreams from My Father"" illustrates this collectivistic and conformist mindset because the president relates that he chose to associate with “Marxist professors” and discuss the ideas of Marxist thinker Frantz Fanon to “avoid being mistaken for a sellout” while he was at Columbia University in the early 1980s.

"Follow Us National Review Sanders Rebukes Manchin’s Downsized Ceiling for Reconciliation Bill This Day in Liberal Judicial Activism—September 12 The Supreme Court in the American Constitutional Order The Myth of the Red Pill The Billionaires’ Party Conservative infighting over whether the United States should intervene militarily in Libya is sign of good health. To remain vital, an ideological movement needs to have its basic assumptions challenged occasionally. We need to correct our wayward courses rather than allow mistakes based on faulty strategy to serve as precedents for the next missteps. Many conservatives (particularly neoconservatives) are strong supporters of intervention, out of a deep conviction that the global advance of freedom promotes American security. I happen to disagree, at least insofar as the “freedom agenda” relies on the U.S. military as its agent. Regardless of where one comes out on the policy, though, we all ought to agree on at least one thing: The Constitution must control the implementation of whatever policy wins the day. Yet it has become necessary to ask whether even this principle, so fundamental to a free, self-determining people, is still unanimously honored. On Thursday evening, the U.N. Security Council voted 10–0 (with five abstentions, including China, Russia, and Germany) to authorize the use of military force (i.e., “all necessary measures”) against Libya. Ostensibly, the resolution is designed to protect the Libyan people. But not to mince words, it is a license for war against the regime of Moammar Qaddafi. It would kick hostilities off with a no-fly zone over Libya. As a practical matter, American armed forces must do the heavy lifting if the strategy is to have a prayer, and indications are that President Obama intends to oblige. There is a catch: The Security Council is powerless to “authorize” the U.S. military to do a damned thing. The validity of American combat operations is a matter of American law, and that means Congress must authorize them. Our Constitution vests Congress with the power to declare war. That authority cannot be delegated to an international tribunal that lacks political accountability to the American people. The decision to go to war is the most significant one a body politic can make. Thus the Framers designed our system to make certain that the responsible officials are answerable to the people whose lives are at stake and who are expected to foot the bills. Contrary to the insistence of many on the right and the left, this has never meant that military operations may not be launched in the absence of a declaration of war. Indeed, although the United States has engaged in many wars and lesser conflicts, war has been formally declared only five times. Still, the circumstances for departing from this formality are narrowly defined. The first is obvious: an actual or imminent strike against the United States. There is no question that the government’s principal responsibility is the security of the governed. The president, as commander-in-chief, has not only the authority but the duty to order the use of any force necessary to protect the United States from hostile powers that attack or are preparing to attack. The principle is clear, and the Supreme Court has endorsed it since the 19th century. But this is not a blank check for the president. At a certain point in time — which may vary with the peculiar circumstances of different armed conflicts — Congress must weigh in and either endorse or put a stop to presidential war-making. It may do the latter by refusing to support the president’s actions and calling for military operations to cease. If the president refuses to honor this expression of disfavor by the people’s representatives, Congress may use its power of the purse to defund military operations. If the president tries to persist, Congress may even impeach him. The central point is that the commander-in-chief’s brute power is not a limitless authority. To be valid, combat operations must at some early, practical point be blessed by Congress, even if the president has righteously ordered them in response to an attack on our country. The other circumstance of departure from the formal declaration of war occurs when Congress functionally declares war by approving combat without using the magic words “declare war.” A good example of this is the authorization for the use of military force Congress enacted, and President Bush signed, in the days after 9/11. Some on the left — largely to bolster their contention that terrorism should be treated as a law-enforcement issue — take the position that sovereign nations cannot truly engage in war with sub-sovereign terrorist organizations. Furthermore, it was unknown right after 9/11 (in fact, it remains unknown today) whether any foreign nation knowingly assisted al-Qaeda in the 9/11 plot. To avoid bogging down over such matters, Congress substantially declared war without using those words: It provided the president with sweeping authority to attack the enemy and reaffirmed that authorization several times with funding. Note that both situations warranting departure from the formal declaration of war involve actual danger to the United States (or, worse, completed attacks against the United States). That is common sense. Government cannot perform its essential security function unless the president can act in a true crisis. The nation could otherwise be destroyed. In due course, though, Congress must endorse or reject presidential action. The system is designed to ensure that the nation can protect itself but does not commit to war unless the American people consent. I would like to assume that conservative proponents of intervention in Libya agree with this proposition. Earlier this week, in taking issue with my colleagues at National Review over an editorial calling for military operations against the Qaddafi regime, I voiced surprise at the editors’ suggestion that a request from the Arab League sufficed as justification for dispatching American armed forces. To be fair, however, no objection specifically based on the lack of congressional support had been brought to the editors’ attention. The passage to which I objected may merely have been meant to address the separate question of whether it was necessary or prudent to wait for additional international support. Transnational progressives and national-security conservatives may hotly debate whether any endorsement from some international body (in particular, the U.N. Security Council) is necessary before the United States may legitimately take military action. But there should be no debating that absent a hostile invasion of our country, a forcible attack against our interests, or a clear threat against us so imminent that Americans may be harmed unless prompt action is taken, the United States should not launch combat operations without congressional approval. That is especially true in Libya. There is no realistic prospect of harm to the United States from Qaddafi’s regime. Concededly, I do not believe there is sufficient justification to use U.S. military force — I don’t even think it’s a close case, and I think proponents are seriously discounting the net harm using force could cause. But I am talking now about propriety, not policy. Let’s assume for argument’s sake that: a) U.S. interests are dangerously harmed by the instability caused when a dictator is allowed to murder his own people with impunity; b) Qaddafi’s opposition, even if it prominently includes anti-American Islamists, may turn out to be tolerably democratic and less anti-American than Qaddafi; c) the advance of freedom means the retreat of Islamic terror, and therefore promotes American national security; d) Qaddafi is a terrorist enemy of the United States who has committed acts of war that cry out for a response; e) in his current precarious straits, it will be in Qaddafi’s interest to renege on his commitment to abandon pursuit of mass-destruction weapons (WMD), and that could exacerbate a regional arms race, likely landing WMD in the hands not only of Qaddafi but of anti-American regimes and terrorist organizations; and f) the “international community” is more or less unified in asking the United States — the lone global superpower capable of crushing Qaddafi quickly — to act. Even if all of that were true, there would be no good reason for President Obama to launch military action without congressional approval. Yet that appears to be exactly what he is doing. In his remarks Friday, committing to what he promised would be a limited military engagement (with no ground forces, basically just air power), the president never even hinted that he might seek Congress’s imprimatur. To the contrary, he asserted that the “use of force” was “authorized” by the “strong resolution” of the “U.N. Security Council,” which was acting “in response to a call for action by the Libyan people and the Arab League.” Many of the Libyan people, to say nothing of the Arab League, do not mean the United States well. But even if they were strong allies, that would make no difference. Only the American people and their representatives in the United States Congress get to make the “call for action” that involves enmeshing our armed forces and our country in a war. In terms of American national security, there is no emergency. The only threat here is to Libyans who oppose Qaddafi. If that threat is truly worthy of American military intervention, President Obama and intervention proponents should be able to make that case to Congress quickly and persuasively. The president’s party controls the Senate, and even though Republicans control the House, the GOP has consistently rallied to the support of Democratic presidents when American national security is clearly at stake. But it’s not. Thus, it is highly likely that Congress cannot be persuaded, quickly or otherwise. But the dim prospect for success is not an acceptable reason to end-run the process. In the Libya situation, our constitutional system calls for seeking a congressional authorization of military force. Even if that weren’t so, it is terrible policy to go to war without public support. If the president and proponents of intervention cannot win congressional approval, that is a reason to refrain from going to war, not a reason to refrain from asking for approval. I used to think we all agreed about that. I hope we still do. — Andrew C.

"Sign In ← return to Water Cooler The viral video sensation showing a bullying incident at an Australian school has brought the issue of bullying back into the spotlight. Here in the United States, the Obama administration has made school bullying a federal issue. Last week, President Barack Obama addressed an anti-bullying conference with First Lady Michelle Obama at his side. The administration’s anti-bullying campaign has been ongoing since the beginning of Mr. Obama’s term. The Department of Justice announced in December 2010 its intention to hold liable school districts that fail to protect students that are bullied. DOJ’s website states: The Civil Rights Division and the entire Justice Department are committed to ending bullying and harassment in schools, and the video highlights the Department’s authority to enforce federal laws that protect students from discrimination and harassment at school because of their race, national origin, disability, religion, and sex, including harassment based on nonconformity with gender stereotypes. The statement later says: The enforcement of the Equal Protection Clause, Title IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 in school districts is a top priority of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. Additional information is available at the Civil Rights Division’s Educational Opportunities Section website at www.justice.gov/crt/edo/. Here is the catch. DOJ will only investigate bullying cases if the victim is considered protected under the 1964 Civil Rights legislation. In essence, only discrimination against a victim’s race, sex, national origin, disability, or religion will be considered by DOJ. The overweight straight white male who is verbally and/or physically harassed because of his size can consider himself invisible to the Justice Department. Apparently, the Justice Department is going by George Orwell’s famous Animal Farm ending: “All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others.” “We can only take action where we have legal authority,” wrote DOJ spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa in a December 2010 e-mail to The Washington Times Water Cooler. She continues: “As stated in the website below, we are statutorily authorized to initiate suits under Title IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974, and under Title III of the American with Disabilities Act. More information on the Civil Rights Act, Equal Educational Opportunities Act, and the ADA can be found here:  ” The Justice Department’s anti-bullying initiative is tantamount to bringing hate crime legislation to the public school system. Obviously, not only is the heterosexual white male student out of luck but inner city minority students lose out in this deal too. If a schoolyard bully is a straight black male and his target is another straight black male where does that leave the victim in the eyes of Attorney General Eric Holder? What about two female students of the same sexual orientation and race? Is the victim in the latter situation considered to be less equal in the eyes of Obama’s Justice Department than a minority student who is picked on by a heterosexual white male student with no disabilities? Unfortunately, the Justice Department is politicizing its priorities yet again. One must wonder why the administration believes it should be micro managing local school districts’ bullying problems. When the Justice Department is more interested in making ideological statements through seemingly sugar coated campaigns, no one should feel protected.

"© 1998-2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All Rights Reserved Vice President Joe Biden, speaking at a fundraiser in Philadelphia Friday, compared Republicans in Congress to people who excuse rapists by blaming their victims. The vice president, known for speaking his mind and at times putting his foot in his mouth, said that Republicans who want to cut spending while at the same time cutting taxes for the wealthy are similar to rape apologists. “When a woman got raped, blame her because she was wearing a skirt too short, she looked the wrong way or she wasn't home in time to make the dinner,” Biden said.“We've gotten by that,” he said. “But it's amazing how these Republicans, the right wing of this party – whose philosophy threw us into this God-awful hole we’re in, gave us the tremendous deficit we’ve inherited – that they’re now using, now attempting to use, the very economic condition they have created to blame the victim – whether it’s organized labor or ordinary middle-class working men and women. It's bizarre. It's bizarre.” After Biden's appearance at the fundraiser, his office tried to focus on the economic message. ""The vice president was obviously making the point that on any issue, we shouldn't blame the victim,"" Biden spokeswoman Elizabeth Alexander said. ""Blaming workers or union members for states' fiscal crises – an argument made by some Republican governors – isn't the answer."" President Obama has tapped Biden to be his lead negotiator with congressional Republicans on the budget. Republicans quickly seized on Biden's comments with the party's House campaign arm calling them ""tasteless and offensive."" ""As much as Vice President BidenJoe BidenSocial media making political polarization worse: report Biden and UK's Johnson to meet for talks this month: report Toyota, Honda knock union-made EV incentive in Dems' spending package MORE should retract this specific statement, he should apologize for comparing our country’s dismal economic situation to such horrid acts as violence against women,” said Joanna Burgos, spokeswoman for the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC). The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) raised about $400,000 from the fundraiser in Philadelphia. The DCCC raised more money than its Republican counterpart in February and January.

"The White House Office of Management and Budget projects that this year mandatory spending will exceed federal revenue. Congress could cut every dime of discretionary spending and Washington would still run a deficit. Years ahead of forecasts, Social Security paid out more money than it took in last year. So who in Washington is serious about tackling the deficit and looming tidal wave of debt? Not President Obama. Not anti-tax hardliners who are going after Republicans who negotiate with Democrats. And not D.C. Democrats who oppose needed entitlement reform. There aren't many people on the right side of this issue because there is a schism in Washington between adults who understand that the government has to cut spending and children who don't want to eat their spinach. On the side of the angels, I'd start with Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla. He has looked at the budget charts and the scary trajectories. And he fears, as he wrote in the Washington Post, ""a forcing event"" if the government effectively runs out of credit. This is a moral issue to Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., who told Politico's Mike Allen last week that when the credit runs out, there's no safety net. And: ""We can't be good at our jobs if all we're worried about is keeping our jobs."" In Coburn and Ryan, America can find the leadership that is lacking on Pennsylvania Avenue. President Obama stood an arm's length from recommendations made by the bipartisan fiscal commission he created. He won't stick out his neck. He wants Republicans to go first. Indeed, Obama has shown so little leadership thaton Friday a group of 64 senators - 32 Democrats and 32 Republicans -were asking the president for support on work toward a comprehensive deficit reduction package. Ahem. They shouldn't have to ask. Now, Coburn and Ryan don't agree on everything. Coburn voted to back recommendations made by the bipartisan fiscal commission. Ryan voted against them. But they're not just telling their base what it wants to hear. Ditto Democratic Sens. Dick Durbin of Illinois and Kent Conrad of North Dakota, who have been meeting with Coburn and other Republicans to form a bipartisan Senate group to tackle thorny entitlement issues. It tells you something about today's political climate that Republicans have been scolded just for talking with Democrats. After the Wall Street Journal reported that the negotiators were considering a tax overhaul that would eliminate loopholes and net an extra $180 billion over 10 years, Americans for Tax Reform head Grover Norquist wrote to Coburn and company to remind them that a tax code overhaul ""would most likely be a violation"" of his group's Taxpayer Protection Pledge. Norquist explained to the Washington Post, ""I think golf and cocaine would (be) more constructive ways to spend one's free time than negotiating with Democrats on spending restraint."" In other words, Norquist persists by ignoring the fact that there are more Democrats than Republicans in the Senate and there's a Democrat in the White House. Coburn's communications director, John Hart, noted, ""Grover's pledge has become the security blanket of American politics that helps Republicans feel secure and innocent while borrowing and spending. His brand of tax-cut-and-spend Republicanism, however, is fighting a losing battle against math. We're running out of places from which to borrow."" Or as the National Review's Kevin D. Williamson opined, ""Norquist should call his outfit 'Americans for Tax Deferal.' "" The left has its Grover Norquists, too. Last week Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., introduced a bill to require a two-thirds vote in the House and Senate for any measure that would cut Social Security benefits. Boxer argued that Social Security is ""in surplus"" - true technically, but you have to ignore the math. Washington already spent the surplus. Last year, Social Security paid out some $37 billion more than it took in. Boxer seems to think that a two-thirds requirement will prevent a return to the days when people jumped out of windows because they couldn't make ends meet. Please. Reformers are floating a proposal to raise the retirement age from age 67 to age 68 by 2050 and 69 by 2075. As Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., told the Washington newspaper, the Hill, ""If you change it a month a year beginning in the year 2014, it's benign, relatively benign. The earlier you make the changes, the easier they are."" The Sanders-Boxer measure ""makes it harder to have a comprehensive deal,"" said Josh Gordon, policy director of the fiscal watchdog Concord Coalition. Senate rules already require 60 votes to allow a vote on a reform. Only treaties have a two-thirds mandate. President Obama might as well be a potted plant on this issue. And thanks to partisans like Norquist and Boxer, Washington continues to delay the day of reckoning. Political conventional wisdom has blinded them. They dare not give an inch. They cannot propose anything difficult. They cannot solve problems. You can e-mail Debra J. Saunders at dsaunders@sfchronicle.com. Read her blog at www..com/ blogs/debra-saunders."
"Is this the same president the American people elected 3 years ago? During the election of 2008, he sat down with the Boston Globe staff for a little question and answer: Globe: In what circumstances, if any, would the president have constitutional authority to bomb Iran without seeking a use-of-force authorization from Congress? Obama: The President does not have power under the Constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation. Note that the use of the word “unilateral” in his statement, used in context of the question, refers to the president acting unilaterally as in without congressional approval, not unilateral as in American forces only. He was correct in his statement. He goes on to say: Obama: As Commander-in-Chief, the President does have a duty to protect and defend the United States. In instances of self-defense, the President would be within his constitutional authority to act before advising Congress or seeking its consent. He is again correct, referring to the War Powers Resolution of 1973(coincidently the same resolution number as the current UN resolution), which allows the president to send U.S. armed forces into action abroad only by authorization of Congress or if the United States is already under attack or serious threat. This is not applicable to the current war against Libya, as we were never under attack or serious threat. He goes on to make the following observation: Obama: History has shown us time and again, however, that military action is most successful when it is authorized and supported by the Legislative branch. It is always preferable to have the informed consent of Congress prior to any military action. Yep, undeclared wars haven’t gone very well for us in the past. He even goes on to brag about some of his recently introduced legislation: Obama: I recently introduced S.J. Res. 23, which states in part that “any offensive military action taken by the United States against Iran must be explicitly authorized by Congress.” Sounds a lot like Ron Paul’s recent proposed legislation: H. Con. Res. 31: Expressing the sense of Congress that the President is required to obtain in advance specific statutory authorization for the use of United States Armed Forces in response to civil unrest in Libya. Obama was refering to Iran, but one would think that his principles would also apply to Libya. I must admit, as far as foreign policy goes, I liked 2007 Obama, but who is this Obama we now have? He has ignored the constitution and his own principles. He cannot plead ignorance, he knew the right answers 3 years ago, when it was Bush ignoring the constitution. But it is Ok, because the UN says it is, right? Wrong. Article 2 Section 7 of the UN charter expressly forbids the “United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state”. The UN reaffirmed this stance in 1981 with the Declaration on the Inadmissibility of Intervention and Interference in the Internal Affairs of the State, which says: Reaffirming, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, that no State has the right to intervent directly or indirectly for any reason whatsoever in the internal or external affairs of any other State, Reaffirming further the fundamental principle of the Charter of the United Nations that all States have the duty not to threaten or use force against the sovereignty, political independence or territorial integrity of other States. It could be argued that this action is interfering with the internal affairs of Libya, but I will explore a different way this is being violated. Since the UN cannot interfere with the internal affairs of any state, I believe the resolution cannot be used as justification for Obama to use troops without congressional authorization. If a resolution was to cause us to bypass our preexisting constitution, it would be interfering with our internal affairs. Our Constitution is not second to the UN charter and should not be treated as such. Authorization for placing our troops in harms way cannot be done by the UN, it must come from congress, who represent the will of the American people, as well as the wellbeing of the troops and their families. Sign up to receive stimulating conservative Christian commentary in your inbox. Yep, this action is wrong in so many ways. First, we shouldn’t be there (If Europeans & the Arab League want it, they should step up.), as it’s not our interest. Second, it’s pure regime change, not about democracy. Nor is it about human rights or human suffering. After all, we’re not going into Bahrain, Syria, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, N. Korea, The Union of Myanmar or Somalia, any of which classify as worse antidemocratic governments or places of worse systemic abuse. And finally, there is some issue about the nature of the role of Congress in military missions (FWIW: I’m not sure how bombing sites in Pakistan was ever authorized). However, it’s not as if informing Congress actually means anything from a *practical* standpoint anymore. Congress critters don’t want a say in the matter of Libya: They want deniability. Most would rather keep keep mute than stick their necks out in any way that could hurt their re-election. Comments are closed."
"The US Army has apologised for graphic photographs of US soldiers grinning over the corpses of Afghan civilians they had allegedly killed. The photos published by Germany's Der Spiegel magazine were said to be among many seized by US Army investigators. An army statement said the photographs were ""repugnant"" but were already being used as evidence in a court martial. Afghan civilian deaths at the hands of foreign forces is a highly sensitive issue in Afghanistan. These photographs are purported to have been taken by a ""rogue"" US Army unit in Afghanistan in 2010. Such images are only going to exacerbate tensions between the Afghan government and the people on the one hand and the US-led coalition on the other, says the 's Paul Wood in Kabul. It is unclear exactly when the photographs published were taken but Der Spiegel says they are among 4,000 pictures and pieces of video they have obtained. Some of the images show two soldiers kneeling over a body. They each hold the face of the dead man up to the camera by grabbing his hair and turning his head. One of the American soldiers is grinning. The US Army said these photographs depict ""actions repugnant to us as human beings and contrary to the standards and values of the United States Army"". ""The actions portrayed in these photographs remain under investigation and are now the subject of ongoing US court-martial proceedings, in which the accused are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty,"" it added. Soldiers who are convicted will be held accountable as appropriate, the army says. Der Spiegel magazine says it has identified one of the soldiers in the photographs as Cpl Jeremy Morlock. He is one of five soldiers accused of the premeditated murder of three Afghan civilians earlier this year. Cpl Morlock agreed to plead guilty in late February and get a shorter prison term if he testified against the other accused soldiers. They deny the charges. Another seven soldiers from the same unit have been charged with conspiracy to cover up the alleged murders. Cpl Morlock's court martial is due to resume on Wednesday. The five accused of murder allegedly threw grenades and opened fire on civilians in unprovoked assaults, while the other seven are accused of dismembering the victims and collecting body parts. These photographs purportedly depict the alleged actions of a few ""renegade"" soldiers, but Afghan sensitivities about civilian deaths are running high after a series of incidents in which coalition forces have been blamed for accidentally killing civilians in bombing raids. ""This could inflame the situation. This is the last thing we expected at this time. Our position is very clear, stop killing civilians and this killing is not acceptable to the president, to the country and to the people of Afghanistan,"" an official from Afghanistan's National Security Council which deals with the US army, who wished to remain unnamed, told the 's Bilal Sarwary. A record number of civilians were killed in Afghanistan last year. More than 2,700 civilians were killed in 2010 - up 15% on the year before. A UN report on civilian deaths said that the Taliban were responsible for 75% of all deaths. The proportion killed by Afghan and Nato forces fell, accounting for 16% of civilian deaths. Correspondents say that the deaths of Afghans by foreign hands provokes greater outrage than killings by the Taliban.

"The missile strikes that inaugurated America's latest attempt at regime change were launched 29 days before the 50th anniversary of another such — the Bay of Pigs of April 17, 1961. Then the hubris of American planners was proportional to their ignorance of everything relevant, from Cuban sentiment to Cuba's geography. The fiasco was a singularly feckless investment of American power. Does practice make perfect? In today's episode, America has intervened in a civil war in a tribal society, the dynamics of which America does not understand. And America is supporting one faction, the nature of which it does not know. ""We are standing with the people of Libya,"" says Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, evidently confident that ""the"" people are a harmonious unit. Many in the media call Moammar Gadhafi's opponents ""freedom fighters,"" and perhaps they are, but no one calling them that really knows how the insurgents regard one another, or understand freedom, or if freedom, however understood, is their priority. But, then, knowing is rarely required in the regime-change business. The Weekly Standard, a magazine for regime-change enthusiasts, serenely says: ""The Libyan state is a one-man operation. Eliminate that man and the whole edifice may come tumbling down."" And then good things must sprout? In Libya, mission creep began before the mission did. A no-fly zone would not accomplish what Barack Obama calls ""a well-defined goal,"" the ""protection of civilians."" So the no-fly zone immediately became protection for aircraft conducting combat operations against Gadhafi's ground forces. America's war aim is inseparable from — indeed, obviously is — destruction of that regime. So our purpose is to create a political vacuum, into which we hope good things will spontaneously flow. But if Gadhafi cannot be beaten by the rebels, are we prepared to supply their military deficiencies? And if the decapitation of his regime produces what the removal of Saddam Hussein did — bloody chaos — what then are our responsibilities regarding the tribal vendettas we may have unleashed? How long are we prepared to police the partitioning of Libya? Explaining his decision to wage war, Obama said Gadhafi has ""lost the confidence of his own people and the legitimacy to lead."" Such meretricious boilerplate seems designed to anesthetize thought. When did Gadhafi lose his people's confidence? When did he have legitimacy? American doctrine — check the Declaration of Independence — is that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. So there are always many illegitimate governments. When is it America's duty to scrub away these blemishes on the planet? Is there a limiting principle of humanitarian interventionism? If so, would Obama take a stab at stating it? Congress' power to declare war resembles a muscle that has atrophied from long abstention from proper exercise. This power was last exercised on June 5, 1942 (against Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary), almost 69 years, and many wars, ago. It thus may seem quaint, and certainly is quixotic, for Indiana's Richard Lugar — ranking Republican on, and former chairman of, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee — to say, correctly, that Congress should debate and vote on this. There are those who think that if the United Nations gives the United States permission to wage war, the Constitution becomes irrelevant. Let us find out who in Congress supports this proposition, which should be resoundingly refuted, particularly by Republicans currently insisting that government, and especially the executive, should be on a short constitutional leash. If all Republican presidential aspirants are supine in the face of unfettered presidential war-making and humanitarian interventionism, the Republican field is radically insufficient. On Dec. 29, 1962, in Miami's Orange Bowl, President John Kennedy, who ordered the Bay of Pigs invasion, addressed a rally of survivors and supporters of that exercise in regime change. Presented with the invasion brigade's flag, Kennedy vowed, ""I can assure you that this flag will be returned to this brigade in a free Havana."" Eleven months later, on Nov. 2, 1963, his administration was complicit in another attempt at violent regime change — the coup against, and murder of, South Vietnam's President Ngo Dinh Diem. The Saigon regime was indeed changed, so perhaps this episode counts as a success, even if Saigon is now Ho Chi Minh City. Will's e-mail address is georgewill@washpost.com."
"Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. Just a couple of months ago, in the wake of Jared Loughner’s shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, simple talk of “targeting” a political opponent for defeat was treated as beyond the pale. But let’s look at some more recent language — and conduct — that our bien-pensant punditry can’t be bothered to notice, let alone condemn. In Michigan, protesters opposed to Gov. Rick Snyder’s austerity budget broke a window to get into the capitol building. One faces felony charges after assaulting police with an edged weapon; 14 were arrested. In Washington, DC, the windows at GOP headquarters were shot out, not the first time that Republican offices have been subject to such attacks. In Madison, Wis., the state capitol was occupied for weeks by teachers-union members and their supporters. Doors and windows were broken; a mob tried to keep Republican state senators from entering the Senate chamber to vote. And blogger Ann Althouse — a Wisconsin law professor who voted for Barack Obama — received nasty threats for the crime of posting video depicting this thuggish conduct on YouTube: “We will f— you up,” the threateners wrote. This was not the first threat she has received for her blogging. The GOP state senators who supported Gov. Scott Walker’s budget also received death threats, including an e-mail reading, in part: “I want to make this perfectly clear. Because of your actions today and in the past couple of weeks I and the group of people that are working with me have decided that we’ve had enough. We feel that you and your republican dictators have to die. “This is how it’s going to happen: I as well as many others know where you and your family live, it’s a matter of public records. We have all planned to assult [sic] you by arriving at your house and putting a nice little bullet in your head. “However, this isn’t enough. We also have decided that this may not be enough to send the message. So we have built several bombs that we have placed in various locations around the areas in which we know that you frequent. This includes, your house, your car, the state capitol, and well I won’t tell you all of them because that’s just no fun.” This threat was more credible because mobs of union protesters had already visited senators’ houses, screaming and banging on the windows. At the Huffington Post, liberal Lee Stranahan wonders why this kind of thing isn’t getting more attention from the traditional media who were tut-tutting over much more minor (and even imaginary) offenses to civility so very recently. “Ignoring the story of these threats is deeply, fundamentally wrong. It’s bad, biased journalism that will lead to no possible good outcome and progressives should be leading the charge against it. “Just before writing this article, I did a Google search and it’s stunning to find out that the right-wing media really isn’t exaggerating — proven death threats against politicians are being ignored by the supposedly honest media. If you’ve never agreed with a single thing that Limbaugh, Bill O’Reilly et al have said about anything, you can’t in any good conscience say that they don’t have a point here. Death threats are wrong and if a story like Wisconsin is national news for days, then so are death threats.” He’s right, but the big-media folks seem so anxious to peddle the same tired storyline — right-wingers are violent and ignorant, left-wingers are peaceful and virtuous — that they almost have to ignore anything that will spoil the narrative. But in doing this, they only undermine their own position more. Word still gets out — even to liberals at the Huffington Post. And people catch on: If there are big stories out there that traditional media won’t cover because it offends their storyline, then why listen to traditional media at all?

"In looking at the foreign ownership of the U.S. national debt, we realized that we could determine whether a nation is growing or fading in relative economic power by whether or not its share of the U.S. national debt is growing or falling with respect to other nations over time. As you might imagine, a nation whose relative economic power is on the rise will see its share of the U.S. national debt it might own rise over time, which will most often be a result of it being able to run a trade surplus with the United States for a sustained period of time. Here, the nation running a sustained trade surplus would buy U.S. government-issued debt as a way to help balance the books for its international trade with the United States. The longer that goes on, the larger the share it gains of the U.S. national debt. We found that that China and Brazil were the two nations whose relative economic power were on the rise during most of the first decade of the twenty-first century. But in that analysis, we left out the nation whose relative economic power declined the most substantially by that measure - the United States! You can begin seeing what we mean in our first chart, which adds the contributions from U.S. individuals and institutions, individuals such as people who own savings bonds, to institutions, which includes banks, private pension and retirement funds and the Federal Reserve, to the contributions of the U.S. Treasury ""borrowing"" money from other federal government entities, such as military and civilian government retirement funds and Social Security. Here, we see that the relative amounts of the U.S. national debt owned by U.S. entities has not grown anywhere near as fast over much of the past decade as the portions owned by foreign powers. That's especially true for U.S. government pension plans and Social Security, whose ownership of the U.S. national debt has grown at a steady pace over the past decade. By contrast, we see an explosion in the amount of U.S. debt held by all other entities, especially beginning after August 2008 as the financial crisis of that year began. Our next chart maps the percentage share of the U.S. national debt for each of the indicated debt holders for each month from March 2000 through December 2010 (we're limited to only going back to March 2000 by the U.S. Treasury's available foreign-owned debt data. The percentages shown on the chart indicate each debt holders relative percentage share of the entire U.S. national debt in March 2000 and in December 2010. What we see here is that the portion of the U.S. national debt owned by U.S. persons and entities has fallen from the levels of March 2000, while the percentage share held by foreign entities has risen through December 2010. This outcome indicates that the relative economic power of the U.S. has slipped during the period from March 2000 through December 2010, and most dramatically following August 2008. What's particularly disturbing is that the U.S. trade deficit with China has fallen since August 2008, which means that China's growing share of the U.S. national debt in the time since is not being driven by that nation's trade surplus with the United States and the need to balance the books of that international trade. Instead, it would appear that China's increasing ownership share of the U.S. national debt is aimed at effectively propping up the U.S. government and its spending. Why China would desire to acquire U.S. debt in excess of what it would seem to need to balance its books to support its international trade is an exercise we'll leave to others. We'll simply observe that they likely believe the policy to be to their advantage in enhancing their relative status with respect to the United States, and so far, there are several indications that suggest that China's enhanced status is being recognized at the highest level.

"What is the stupidest thing that the U.S. federal government spent money on last year? You don't have to be particularly partisan to realize that the potential list of really stupid things that the government spent money on last year is pretty long. After all, common sense alone should tell you that a not-so-small part of the $3,720,701,000,000 that the federal government projected it would spend in 2010 went to things that, on first glance, after a second look and even after a really long, detailed cost-benefit analysis, could have been spent more smartly. Or perhaps even better, money that the government could have chosen to not spend at all! (We know, if only our elected officials would realize that's an option!...) But how do we pick which federal spending line item was the most stupid thing for the federal government to spend money on in 2010? We started by looking at things that the federal government spent money on in the last year that, by all objective standards, failed to achieve their stated goals. Namely, we looked at things that were part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, aka ""The Stimulus Bill"", aka ""The Stimulus Package"", which was intended to create permanent jobs in both 2009 and 2010, and which is widely recognized by the public to have failed. We then looked at spending line items whose cost exceeded at least $31,000, which we'll use as a reference point for all these stupid spending projects. Why $31,000? As it happens, that's approximately the amount of money the federal government projected it would spend per U.S. household in 2010. More importantly, we can use that figure to estimate how many households could have been spared the burden of the federal government's most stupid spending if only the federal government had just shown some restraint. So which part of the 2009 Stimulus Package was the stupidest thing that the federal government funded in 2010? In our opinion, it was perhaps a little construction project we'll call ""The Sidewalk to Nowhere"". This federal government-funded construction project only cost U.S. taxpayers $89,298, but somehow managed to neither create any permanent jobs nor did it provide any meaningful benefits for the citizens of the community it served! That community is Boynton, Oklahoma, where the federal government funded a project to replace a quarter-mile long sidewalk that had itself just been replaced five years earlier. The fully repaved stretch of sidewalk would then fully comply with the federal sidewalk guidelines dictated by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). But don't take our word for it. Here are the before and after pictures of the project, which clearly shows the magnitude of the federal government's achievement in bringing the full quarter-mile length of the sidewalk into full compliance with the ADA: Now, aside from the idea that the federal government apparently has specifically dedicated funding and personnel for the purpose of developing design and construction guidelines for sidewalks, which itself means that there's probably a federal sidewalk inspector on the federal payroll to enforce them, the $89,298 that was spent on this specific boondoggle could have spared the equivalent of nearly three American households from being excessively burdened by mindless federal spending, but that weren't. That may not seem like much money, at least until you consider the possibility that one of those three households could have been yours. So why do we call it the ""Sidewalk to Nowhere""? Truth be told, that's just a bit of creative license on our part, because in reality, the ""Sidewalk to Nowhere"" really does go somewhere. It leads past a vacant lot straight to a ditch. Perhaps this is the previously missing feature that now makes the sidewalk fully comply with the federal Americans with Disabilities Act. Thanks to your tax dollars at work, the disabled can now much more easily access the ditch at the end of the ""Sidewalk to Nowhere"" in Boynton, Oklahoma, where many citizens really can't believe that someone actually made a federal case out of repaving one of their sidewalks to specifically provide this kind of unparalleled access for the disabled to what is perhaps the town's least well-known natural amenity. No, we can't make these things up. Except maybe the part about the federal sidewalk inspector. We really don't know if there is one or not!... Oklahoma Department of Transportation.

"The sources of authority are not always venerable - meaning that the accumulated wisdom of the ages and the presence of eternal verities aren't essential factors in authority of every description. There are different kinds of authority. For instance: Legal authority is supposed to be based on rational and normative considerations. Traditional authority is said to be legitimized by immemorial practices etc. Charismatic authority is difficult to account for without a measure of psychological speculation. Unless we have some information concerning why a specific authority should be trusted (or maybe challenged), there is no basis for evaluating it. In the abstract, authority is neither a good nor a bad thing. To argue from authority can be ""mindless and slavish"".(I'd guess you have a religious authority in mind, but you haven't made clear why we should submit to it.) @ Alex - I have been reading Chaucer, and looking at how he uses authority - and a more recent example was Robert Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy.Indeed, this was the standard mode of argument in psychiatry when I began training in the early 1980s - there was a lineage of great (mostly Germanic, some French) psychiatric authorities whose opinions were studied and compared.(Of course, as an ambitious and inexperienced young scientist who had conducted a few experiments, I thought this was outrageous - and wanted people to listen to me instead!) Now we have mega-randomized trials, designed and conducted by Big Pharma and implemented by cook books and cash incentives, written up by agencies and published in top journals then disseminated using sophisticated soft-sell propaganda and state power.Progress? - I THINK NOT! On the subject of faking evidence, do look at Steve McIntyre's recent posts at Climate Audit. Wheeeee! @dearieme - I think this sort of stuff is routine behaviour in great swathes of 'science' nowadays; with most 'scientists', editors, publishers, research funding agencies and the civil service all quite happy about it. Which explains my use of scare quotes. I've never looked into The Anatomy of Melancholy which is a very esoteric work, I think. And I haven't looked into The Canterbury Tales for many years, but I suppose the Wife of Bath can be understood as an authority on human relationships because she has been married five times and has much wisdom to impart based on her experience. I would tend to believe, on your authority, what you say about the 'scientific method' and profits orientated research of the big pharmaceutical companies. This is because I believe you are in a far better position to judge this matter than I am. We are generally disposed to trust the authority of expert opinion on the grounds that at some stage it has been policed and validated by peer scrutiny. Sometimes we encounter specialists who because they have competence in one particular field of enquiry are asked for, and are anxious to give, their advice on sundry political and moral questions that bother humanity at large. In these cases, a false authority is often assumed by intellectuals who wear the mask of a disinterested counsellor, but really intend to advance an ideological agenda. @Alex - I intend to blog some more on 'authority' since I don't seem to be making myself clear about it - the sense I intend is much more specific than the usage you imply here. For example, ""I suppose the Wife of Bath can be understood as an authority on human relationships because she has been married five times and has much wisdom to impart based on her experience.""As I understand it, authority (auctorite) is the *opposite* of experience, and I think Chaucer is making a joke when the Wife of Bath puts forward her experience as making her an authority. 'Nuff said - watch this space. The PC crowd is not against authority. They are against authorities that disagree with them. Most PC arguments combine appeals to pro-PC authority with ad hominem attacks on anti-PC authorities. The climate change debate is the classic case; PC zealots insist that pro-climate change scientists have evidence and reason on their side, and their word must be accepted without question, while anti-climate change scientists are immoral shills for the fossil fuel industry, or are not real scientists at all, and therefore their words must be rejected out of hand.

"by Brett Stevens on March 24, 2011 Against Democracy and Equality: The European New Right by Tomislav Sunic 253 pages, Arktos, $18. It’s unreasonable to expect book reviewers to be objective. You get hired on to review a book because your editor thinks that, given where you are in life, you give your readers a reasonable assessment of the utility of the book to them. Whether that’s enjoyment or practical utility doesn’t matter much. In the case of Against Democracy and Equality: The European New Right by Tomislav Sunic, the reaction of this reviewer was both enjoyment and a difficult but rewarding practical utility. This is not a book you read like a novel or technical manual; it’s a book you bite off in small bits, chew and contemplate for a few days before returning. Part of the reason for this power is Sunic’s habit, reminiscent of Aldous Huxley in The Perennial Philosophy (and emulated on this blog), of stitching together the words of many others into a coherent narrative. If in a large room, each person knows part of a story, the storyteller is the guy who calls them out in order to teach recite their part. In the case of the New Right, we see over a dozen historians from both left and right who each contribute a vital point in the outline that makes the argument. The other part for the power of this book comes from its editors, who compiled an excellent series of introductions by Alain de Benoist, David J. Stennet, Paul Gottfried and Sunic himself, in addition to including an equally powerful series of appendices including the summary of New Right beliefs in Manifesto for a European Resistance by de Benoist and Charles Champetier. These give background to the broader work that Sunic does and show the evolution of these concepts toward a definitive political and cultural ideology. The result is a lengthy reading experience. It is difficult to put the book down, to voice the old cliche, except when enough information has soaked in that you and your brain want to take a small vacation to process it. For this reviewer, that meant reading the book in 50-page increments followed by a day or two off to work through what had been presented. Sunic writes with clear, scientific prose; this is necessary because these concepts are not yet in the mainstream, and many of these arguments while not “theoretical” require precision expression of detail. He thus both avoids the Malcolm Gladwell-styled breadlike text that satisfies no one and the dry, spaced out academic style that drives away non-academics. The result is an intensely philosophical book that reads like a plain English contract or Scientific American article. The book is divided into four essential parts: The European New Right has so far not elaborated its own economic doctrine, although one may suspect it of having some sympathy for the theories of ‘organic’ and corporatist economics, advocated earlier in the Twentieth century by Othmar Spann and Leon Walras. As we shall see later, the main thrust of the New Right’s argument is that economics must be completely subordinated to politics and culture and not the other way around. (55) The crisis of modern societies has resulted in an incessant ‘uglification’ whose main vectors are liberalism, Marxism and ‘the American way of life.’ The dominant ideologies of modernity, Marxism and liberalism, embodied by the Soviet Union and America respectively, are harmful to the social well-being of peoples because both reduce every aspect of life to the realm of economic utility and efficiency. The principal enemy of freedom, asserts the New Right, is not Marxism or liberalism per se, bt rather their common belief in egalitarianism. Marxism, incidentally, is not the antithesis of liberalism — it is simply the most dangerous form of egalitarianism that runs rampant through all sectors of the Soviet and American polity. (59) While most Americans understand liberalism as a spectrum from anarchism through Communism, in Europe (apparently) liberalism was seen as an alternate direction to going Communist. Sunic debunks this and other myths with the above. Left-wing movements have traditionally been better at understanding the political role of culture than conservative movements. In contrast, modern conservatives naïvely cling to the belief that, in the long run, only economics can dissolve all radical ideologies, including that of their Marxist foes. (70) If you want to know why the New Right is not your father’s stodgy old conservatism, or your grandfather’s reactionary politics, here is the distinction: the New Right is a cultural movement on par with the left, but holding on to the eternal values of the Right. European culture has nowadays transformed itself into a civilisation that is currently being threatened by an advanced form of social, moral and political decay. After the Industrial Revolution, Europe had passed the stage of culture, and is experiencing today, and in the most acute form, the winter of its life. New forms of political life have emerged in Europe, marked by the ideology of economism and the rule of plutocracy. All sectors of social life are being reduced to an immense economic transaction. And since nobody can ever be fully satisfied, and everybody yearns for more, it is understandable that masses of people will seek a change in their existing communities. This craving for ‘change’ will be translated into the incessant decline of the sense of public responsibility, followed by uprootedness and social anomie, which will inevitably and ultimately lead to Caesarism, or totalitarianism. (94) The above is straight out of Plato, in the language of Spengler. Societies die when they no longer have a social consensus to hold them together, and their populations in the throes of resentment start acting out radical plans for the sake of revenge, which empowers dictators as the chaos grows. If you ever wondered why the electorate are their own worst enemy, this is a good description — they vote by appearance, not by structure or even logical impulse. They’re having a tantrum, not a reasoned response, and the result is they sleepwalk into the hands of their corrupt shepherds. Sunic points out the essential: modern liberalism and Marxism share the same values, and these are the cornerstones of modern society. Even more importantly, these values are “schizoid” or disconnected from their inapplicability, thus in the best postmodern sense, our society is divided between a public dogma and private truths. Universalism, or the idea of a one-size-fits-all dogmatic truth to be applied everywhere all the time, is how this system controls us and constitutes a form of theoretically well-intentioned totalitarianism that, because its precepts are unrealistic, ends up enforcing itself in a feedback loop created by its incompetence and yet insistence on the moral high ground. (As Nietzsche implied, this is why pre-French Revolutionary political systems were based on power and not morality: power decays to more self-critical power, but morality decays to blind power.) For David Thomson, socialist equality is neither feasible nor desirable, since this would spell the doom not only of capitalism, but also bring about the end of culture and civilisation. Nonetheless, Thomson realises that in contemporary liberal societies the craving for equality can become so pervasive that it can totally obscure the love of liberty. (137) New Right thinkers point out that this is a fatal flaw in liberalism, in that it guarantees a perpetual quest (like the concept of “endless war” in Orwell) which will never be satisfied and, because liberty empowers the opposite ideal as well as many others, will eventually come into conflict with liberty. Because egalitarianism is the founding quest of liberalism, it will obliterate any other considerations. Hard totalitarianism: this is the totalitarianism which the Tibetan people have to endure. Soft totalitarianism: the one that operates by virtue of imposing the Western-American cultural model diffused through the media across the entire world. (155) The onslaught of NATO armies, Coca-Cola, pornography and sexual liberation, atheism, freedom and the destruction of social standards, and universalist “internationalism” where people become citizens of the world instead of their host nations, all comprise this soft totalitarian assault. Sunic is making the point politely: modern society is a virus, and it invades all places it can to destroy culture and any way of life outside of commerce, media and bureaucratic government. Similar to Talmon and Arendt, Aron makes a distinction between Nazi totalitarianism and Communist totalitarianism. For him, the first was intrinsically perverse since it was already embodied in its own ideology. By contrast, the latter became totalitarian by following, as Talmon also indicated, its own extreme perfectionist and utopian line. In the last analysis, totalitarianism for Aron is ‘voluntary’ in Nazism, but ‘involuntary’ in Communism. (175) Our new school of thought sets its philosophical system of thought, as far as the domain of ethics is concerned, within the guidelines of the pre-Socratic thinkers, Stoics, Schopenhauer and Nietzsche… Our school stresses the primacy of life over all inherited worldviews; the primacy of soul over spirit, the primacy of feelings over intellect, and finally of character over reason… Hence, it follows that our school is unconditionally opposed to all systems of an absolutist character, given that these systems imply the idea of determinism, of a single truth or of a monotheism, in which we discern the roots of totalitarianism. (206) While this is an informal summary, it captures the spirit (say “gestalt” in a New York accent if it makes you feel better) of this movement as an intellectual culture. Metapolitics is not politics by any other means. It is neither a ‘strategy’ to impose intellectual hegemony, nor an attempt to discredit other possible attitudes or agendas. It rests solely on the premise that ideas play a fundamental role in collective consciousness and, more generally, in human history. (207) In even shorter shorthand: ideas determine history; they are the causes, and the events after them are the effects. Thus first we change the ideas, and then try to make events happen. In the beginning, liberal thought contraposed an autonomous economy to the morality, politics and society in which it had been formerly embedded. Later, it turned commercial value into the essence of all communal life. The advent of the ‘primacy of quantity’ signaled this transition from market economics to market societies, i.e. the extension of the laws of commercial exchange, ruled by ‘the invisible hand,’ to all spheres of existence. (212) The text expands on this definition with a clear definition of the type of anti-absolutism thought, a cosmic “pluriversal” viewpoint, that offsets liberalism; a definition of racism and its difference from ethnonationalism and biological determinism, which is well articulated but covers ground already known by readers of this blog; a viewpoint of the importance of community, self and social order. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and it took me much longer than usual to read it and parse it because every page is charged with stimulus of new thoughts, and evokes unresolved tensions we all exist with in daily life (for example, wouldn’t it be nice to have a society of ideas, not appearances. Against Democracy and Equality: The European New Right also performs a valuable service for the right-wing community, which is that it forces exact and lucid articulation of the values of the New Right, the narrative it would apply to history, and the groundwork for its future political platforms should it gain power. This alone is a big sigh of relief for many, who will be glad to see these ambiguities replaced with the formative shapes of a new movement. Although this is a powerful book, it dances around one question that most of us would like to see resolved, which is whether or not New Right can find common ground with mainstream politics. Much of the book is spent differentiating New Right from old Right, neoconservative, Nazi, racist, etc. and as a result we know what it is clearly not possible, but that leaves us the question of where we can find common ground. Does conservatism continue its big tent outlook, or do we leave behind facilitative politics and try to streamline? If so, how does a New Right-influenced party or individual gain power? These questions are probably far too big for this book, which is already stuffed with information and citations for more reading, so it’s a quibble but a valuable question for Sunic’s next volume. Remember how at the beginning of this review, I wrote that it is impossible for reviewers to remain objective? I have some further quibbles: These are minor objections, and not quite fair ones, since this book was written a long time ago during the throes of the Cold War, when nuclear missiles seemed poised above our beds to erase us and all we knew at any moment, leaving behind ten thousand years of contamination. Where this book triumphs is as a plateau in history; both a stopping point where we look back over the trail so far, and figure out how we got here (and in particular, realize the drastic and destructive changes to European-descended civilizations since the French Revolution) and a template for the future, where we have a list of issues and values that we can use to filter all other ideas and see what sticks. Sunic writes beautifully, and the book is edited with an eye for detail, which makes Against Democracy and Equality the perfect introduction to the New Right for either the layman or the committed and interested reader. I will be recommending this to friends as a watershed volume that serves as an ideal portal to this fertile and provocative realm of thought. You can purchase this book from the publisher for $18.

"Abdel-Hakim al-Hasidi, the Libyan rebel leader, has said jihadists who fought against allied troops in Iraq are on the front lines of the battle against Muammar Gaddafi's regime. In an interview with the Italian newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore, Mr al-Hasidi admitted that he had recruited ""around 25"" men from the Derna area in eastern Libya to fight against coalition troops in Iraq. Some of them, he said, are ""today are on the front lines in Adjabiya"". Mr al-Hasidi insisted his fighters ""are patriots and good Muslims, not terrorists,"" but added that the ""members of al-Qaeda are also good Muslims and are fighting against the invader"". His revelations came even as Idriss Deby Itno, Chad's president, said al-Qaeda had managed to pillage military arsenals in the Libyan rebel zone and acquired arms, ""including surface-to-air missiles, which were then smuggled into their sanctuaries"". Mr al-Hasidi admitted he had earlier fought against ""the foreign invasion"" in Afghanistan, before being ""captured in 2002 in Peshwar, in Pakistan"". He was later handed over to the US, and then held in Libya before being released in 2008. US and British government sources said Mr al-Hasidi was a member of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, or LIFG, which killed dozens of Libyan troops in guerrilla attacks around Derna and Benghazi in 1995 and 1996. Even though the LIFG is not part of the al-Qaeda organisation, the United States military's West Point academy has said the two share an ""increasingly co-operative relationship"". In 2007, documents captured by allied forces from the town of Sinjar, showed LIFG emmbers made up the second-largest cohort of foreign fighters in Iraq, after Saudi Arabia. Earlier this month, al-Qaeda issued a call for supporters to back the Libyan rebellion, which it said would lead to the imposition of ""the stage of Islam"" in the country. British Islamists have also backed the rebellion, with the former head of the banned al-Muhajiroun proclaiming that the call for ""Islam, the Shariah and jihad from Libya"" had ""shaken the enemies of Islam and the Muslims more than the tsunami that Allah sent against their friends, the Japanese""."

Picked the wrong afternoon for it. Every sleepy side-street in this normally agreeable corner of Mayfair is awash with union heavies and other unlovely types who’ve wandered loose from the supposedly half-million-strong protest march against alleged government “spending cuts” – of which, in fact, there are distressingly few. As I write, I am approximately fifty feet from the scene of this balaclava-ed anarchist’s heroic stand. Looks rather less exciting in close-up, I have to report. The livelier lads have already rampaged through Fortnum & Mason, the upscale Piccadilly emporium, and attacked the Ritz. Obvious targets, you might say. But I found it more poignant earlier in the day when I went to a favorite coffee place hoping to enjoy a beverage outside on a pleasant spring day as the massed ranks of British layabouts marched by. Instead, the Polish and Balkan baristas were hurriedly dragging in all the sidewalk tables and chairs before the Socialist Workers’ Party chaps showed up in search of projectiles. Nobody in the Socialist Workers’ Party actually works, which is one reason why it’s Mitteleuropeans frothing your coffee rather than any of the natives. Still, on balance I prefer the class-war thugs trashing the joint, who at least have the courage of their convictions. The “nice” people bussed in from the shires struck me as some of the most stupid people I’ve ever met anywhere on the planet. One elderly lady from Yorkshire told me she was there because her grandson’s university fees were likely to go up. I was in a cranky mood because I hadn’t had my coffee. “You can protest all you like,” I said. “But this country’s broke, so all you’re doing is postponing its reacquaintanceship with reality, and ensuring that your grandson and his contemporaries are going to be stuck with the tab because you guys spent their future.” I pointed out that in her part of the world – northern England – as in Wales and Northern Ireland, the state accounts for three-quarters of the economy. And it’s still not enough for the likes of her and her pals. She stared at me blankly. “Well, I don’t want to argue,” she said politely. “I just think it’s a disgrace.” In a democracy, there are not many easy ways back from insane levels of “social” spending, and certainly not when the leader of Her Majesty’s Loyal Opposition panders to the mob by comparing them to anti-apartheid activists. Judging from the many marchers partial to robotic, pseudo-ethnic West African drumming, the British left’s plan is presumably for the entire country to relaunch itself as the world’s least rhythmic percussion ensemble.

"Many Fascists saw the Charter of Carnaro as an ideal constitution for a Fascist Italy.[133] This behaviour of aggression towards Yugoslavia and South Slavs was pursued by Italian Fascists with their persecution of South Slavs—especially Slovenes and Croats. In 1920, militant strike activity by industrial workers reached its peak in Italy and 1919 and 1920 were known as the ""Red Year"" (Biennio Rosso).[134] Mussolini and the Fascists took advantage of the situation by allying with industrial businesses and attacking workers and peasants in the name of preserving order and internal peace in Italy.[135] Fascists identified their primary opponents as the majority of socialists on the left who had opposed intervention in World War I.[133] The Fascists and the Italian political right held common ground: both held Marxism in contempt, discounted class consciousness and believed in the rule of elites.[136] The Fascists assisted the anti-socialist campaign by allying with the other parties and the conservative right in a mutual effort to destroy the Italian Socialist Party and labour organizations committed to class identity above national identity.[136] Fascism sought to accommodate Italian conservatives by making major alterations to its political agenda—abandoning its previous populism, republicanism and anticlericalism, adopting policies in support of free enterprise and accepting the Catholic Church and the monarchy as institutions in Italy.[137] To appeal to Italian conservatives, Fascism adopted policies such as promoting family values, including policies designed to reduce the number of women in the workforce—limiting the woman's role to that of a mother. The Fascists banned literature on birth control and increased penalties for abortion in 1926, declaring both crimes against the state.[138] Although Fascism adopted a number of anti-modern positions designed to appeal to people upset with the new trends in sexuality and women's rights—especially those with a reactionary point of view—the Fascists sought to maintain Fascism's revolutionary character, with Angelo Oliviero Olivetti saying: ""Fascism would like to be conservative, but it will [be] by being revolutionary.""[139] The Fascists supported revolutionary action and committed to secure law and order to appeal to both conservatives and syndicalists.[140] Prior to Fascism's accommodations to the political right, Fascism was a small, urban, northern Italian movement that had about a thousand members.[141] After Fascism's accommodation of the political right, the Fascist movement's membership soared to approximately 250,000 by 1921.[142] A 2020 article by Daron Acemoğlu, Giuseppe De Feo, Giacomo De Luca, and Gianluca Russo in the Center for Economic and Policy Research, exploring the link between the threat of socialism and Mussolini's rise to power, found ""a strong association between the Red Scare in Italy and the subsequent local support for the Fascist Party in the early 1920s."" According to the authors, it was local elites and large landowners who played an important role in boosting Fascist Party activity and support, which did not come from socialists' core supporters but from centre-right voters, as they viewed traditional centre-right parties as ineffective in stopping socialism and turned to the Fascists. In 2003, historian Adrian Lyttelton wrote: ""The expansion of Fascism in the rural areas was stimulated and directed by the reaction of the farmers and landowners against the peasant leagues of both Socialists and Catholics.""[143] Beginning in 1922, Fascist paramilitaries escalated their strategy from one of attacking socialist offices and the homes of socialist leadership figures, to one of violent occupation of cities. The Fascists met little serious resistance from authorities and proceeded to take over several northern Italian cities.[144] The Fascists attacked the headquarters of socialist and Catholic labour unions in Cremona and imposed forced Italianization upon the German-speaking population of Trent and Bolzano.[144] After seizing these cities, the Fascists made plans to take Rome.[144] On 24 October 1922, the Fascist party held its annual congress in Naples, where Mussolini ordered Blackshirts to take control of public buildings and trains and to converge on three points around Rome.[144] The Fascists managed to seize control of several post offices and trains in northern Italy while the Italian government, led by a left-wing coalition, was internally divided and unable to respond to the Fascist advances.[145] King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy perceived the risk of bloodshed in Rome in response to attempting to disperse the Fascists to be too high.[146] Victor Emmanuel III decided to appoint Mussolini as Prime Minister of Italy and Mussolini arrived in Rome on 30 October to accept the appointment.[146] Fascist propaganda aggrandized this event, known as ""March on Rome"", as a ""seizure"" of power because of Fascists' heroic exploits.[144] Historian Stanley G. Payne says: ""[Fascism in Italy was a] primarily political dictatorship. ... The Fascist Party itself had become almost completely bureaucratized and subservient to, not dominant over, the state itself. Big business, industry, and finance retained extensive autonomy, particularly in the early years. The armed forces also enjoyed considerable autonomy. ... The Fascist militia was placed under military control. ... The judicial system was left largely intact and relatively autonomous as well. The police continued to be directed by state officials and were not taken over by party leaders ... nor was a major new police elite created. ... There was never any question of bringing the Church under overall subservience. ... Sizable sectors of Italian cultural life retained extensive autonomy, and no major state propaganda-and-culture ministry existed. ... The Mussolini regime was neither especially sanguinary nor particularly repressive.""[147] Upon being appointed Prime Minister of Italy, Mussolini had to form a coalition government because the Fascists did not have control over the Italian parliament.[148] Mussolini's coalition government initially pursued economically liberal policies under the direction of liberal finance minister Alberto De Stefani, a member of the Center Party, including balancing the budget through deep cuts to the civil service.[148] Initially, little drastic change in government policy had occurred and repressive police actions were limited.[148] The Fascists began their attempt to entrench Fascism in Italy with the Acerbo Law, which guaranteed a plurality of the seats in parliament to any party or coalition list in an election that received 25% or more of the vote.[149] Through considerable Fascist violence and intimidation, the list won a majority of the vote, allowing many seats to go to the Fascists.[149] In the aftermath of the election, a crisis and political scandal erupted after Socialist Party deputy Giacomo Matteotti was kidnapped and murdered by a Fascist.[149] The liberals and the leftist minority in parliament walked out in protest in what became known as the Aventine Secession.[150] On 3 January 1925, Mussolini addressed the Fascist-dominated Italian parliament and declared that he was personally responsible for what happened, but insisted that he had done nothing wrong. Mussolini proclaimed himself dictator of Italy, assuming full responsibility over the government and announcing the dismissal of parliament.[150] From 1925 to 1929, Fascism steadily became entrenched in power: opposition deputies were denied access to parliament, censorship was introduced and a December 1925 decree made Mussolini solely responsible to the King.[151] In 1929, the Fascist regime briefly gained what was in effect a blessing of the Catholic Church after the regime signed a concordat with the Church, known as the Lateran Treaty, which gave the papacy state sovereignty and financial compensation for the seizure of Church lands by the liberal state in the nineteenth century, but within two years the Church had renounced Fascism in the Encyclical Non Abbiamo Bisogno as a ""pagan idolotry of the state"" which teaches ""hatred, violence and irreverence.""[152] Not long after signing the agreement, by Mussolini's own confession, the Church had threatened to have him ""excommunicated"", in part because of his intractable nature, but also because he had ""confiscated more issues of Catholic newspapers in the next three months than in the previous seven years.""[153] By the late 1930s, Mussolini became more vocal in his anti-clerical rhetoric, repeatedly denouncing the Catholic Church and discussing ways to depose the pope. He took the position that the ""papacy was a malignant tumor in the body of Italy and must 'be rooted out once and for all,’ because there was no room in Rome for both the Pope and himself.""[154] In her 1974 book, Mussolini's widow Rachele stated that her husband had always been an atheist until near the end of his life, writing that her husband was ""basically irreligious until the later years of his life.""[155] The Nazis in Germany employed similar anti-clerical policies. The Gestapo confiscated hundreds of monasteries in Austria and Germany, evicted clergymen and laymen alike and often replaced crosses with swastikas.[156] Referring to the swastika as ""the Devil's Cross"", church leaders found their youth organizations banned, their meetings limited and various Catholic periodicals censored or banned. Government officials eventually found it necessary to place ""Nazis into editorial positions in the Catholic press.""[157] Up to 2,720 clerics, mostly Catholics, were arrested by the Gestapo and imprisoned inside of Germany's Dachau concentration camp, resulting in over 1,000 deaths.[158] The Fascist regime created a corporatist economic system in 1925 with creation of the Palazzo Vidoni Pact, in which the Italian employers' association Confindustria and Fascist trade unions agreed to recognize each other as the sole representatives of Italy's employers and employees, excluding non-Fascist trade unions.[159] The Fascist regime first created a Ministry of Corporations that organized the Italian economy into 22 sectoral corporations, banned workers' strikes and lock-outs and in 1927 created the Charter of Labour, which established workers' rights and duties and created labour tribunals to arbitrate employer-employee disputes.[159] In practice, the sectoral corporations exercised little independence and were largely controlled by the regime, and the employee organizations were rarely led by employees themselves, but instead by appointed Fascist party members.[159] In the 1920s, Fascist Italy pursued an aggressive foreign policy that included an attack on the Greek island of Corfu, ambitions to expand Italian territory in the Balkans, plans to wage war against Turkey and Yugoslavia, attempts to bring Yugoslavia into civil war by supporting Croat and Macedonian separatists to legitimize Italian intervention and making Albania a de facto protectorate of Italy, which was achieved through diplomatic means by 1927.[160] In response to revolt in the Italian colony of Libya, Fascist Italy abandoned previous liberal-era colonial policy of cooperation with local leaders. Instead, claiming that Italians were a superior race to African races and thereby had the right to colonize the ""inferior"" Africans, it sought to settle 10 to 15 million Italians in Libya.[161] This resulted in an aggressive military campaign known as the Pacification of Libya against natives in Libya, including mass killings, the use of concentration camps and the forced starvation of thousands of people.[161] Italian authorities committed ethnic cleansing by forcibly expelling 100,000 Bedouin Cyrenaicans, half the population of Cyrenaica in Libya, from their settlements that was slated to be given to Italian settlers.[162][163] The March on Rome brought Fascism international attention. One early admirer of the Italian Fascists was Adolf Hitler, who less than a month after the March had begun to model himself and the Nazi Party upon Mussolini and the Fascists.[164] The Nazis, led by Hitler and the German war hero Erich Ludendorff, attempted a ""March on Berlin"" modeled upon the March on Rome, which resulted in the failed Beer Hall Putsch in Munich in November 1923.[165] The conditions of economic hardship caused by the Great Depression brought about an international surge of social unrest. According to historian Philip Morgan, ""the onset of the Great Depression ... was the greatest stimulus yet to the diffusion and expansion of fascism outside Italy.""[166] Fascist propaganda blamed the problems of the long depression of the 1930s on minorities and scapegoats: ""Judeo-Masonic-bolshevik"" conspiracies, left-wing internationalism and the presence of immigrants. In Germany, it contributed to the rise of the National Socialist German Workers' Party, which resulted in the demise of the Weimar Republic and the establishment of the fascist regime, Nazi Germany, under the leadership of Adolf Hitler. With the rise of Hitler and the Nazis to power in 1933, liberal democracy was dissolved in Germany and the Nazis mobilized the country for war, with expansionist territorial aims against several countries. In the 1930s, the Nazis implemented racial laws that deliberately discriminated against, disenfranchised and persecuted Jews and other racial and minority groups. Fascist movements grew in strength elsewhere in Europe. Hungarian fascist Gyula Gömbös rose to power as Prime Minister of Hungary in 1932 and attempted to entrench his Party of National Unity throughout the country. He created an eight-hour work day and a forty-eight-hour work week in industry; sought to entrench a corporatist economy; and pursued irredentist claims on Hungary's neighbors.[167] The fascist Iron Guard movement in Romania soared in political support after 1933, gaining representation in the Romanian government, and an Iron Guard member assassinated Romanian prime minister Ion Duca.[168] During the 6 February 1934 crisis, France faced the greatest domestic political turmoil since the Dreyfus Affair when the fascist Francist Movement and multiple far-right movements rioted en masse in Paris against the French government resulting in major political violence.[169] A variety of para-fascist governments that borrowed elements from fascism were formed during the Great Depression, including those of Greece, Lithuania, Poland and Yugoslavia.[170] In the Americas, the Brazilian Integralists led by Plínio Salgado claimed as many as 200,000 members although following coup attempts it faced a crackdown from the Estado Novo of Getúlio Vargas in 1937.[171] In Peru, the fascist Revolutionary Union was a fascist political party which was in power 1931 to 1933. In the 1930s, the National Socialist Movement of Chile gained seats in Chile's parliament and attempted a coup d'état that resulted in the Seguro Obrero massacre of 1938.[172] During the Great Depression, Mussolini promoted active state intervention in the economy. He denounced the contemporary ""supercapitalism"" that he claimed began in 1914 as a failure because of its alleged decadence, its support for unlimited consumerism, and its intention to create the ""standardization of humankind.""[173] Fascist Italy created the Institute for Industrial Reconstruction (IRI), a giant state-owned firm and holding company that provided state funding to failing private enterprises.[174] The IRI was made a permanent institution in Fascist Italy in 1937, pursued Fascist policies to create national autarky and had the power to take over private firms to maximize war production.[174] While Hitler's regime only nationalized 500 companies in key industries by the early 1940s,[175] Mussolini declared in 1934 that ""[t]hree-fourths of Italian economy, industrial and agricultural, is in the hands of the state.""[176] Due to the worldwide depression, Mussolini's government was able to take over most of Italy's largest failing banks, who held controlling interest in many Italian businesses. The Institute for Industrial Reconstruction, a state-operated holding company in charge of bankrupt banks and companies, reported in early 1934 that they held assets of ""48.5 percent of the share capital of Italy"", which later included the capital of the banks themselves.[177] Political historian Martin Blinkhorn estimated Italy's scope of state intervention and ownership ""greatly surpassed that in Nazi Germany, giving Italy a public sector second only to that of Stalin’s Russia.""[178] In the late 1930s, Italy enacted manufacturing cartels, tariff barriers, currency restrictions and massive regulation of the economy to attempt to balance payments.[179] Italy's policy of autarky failed to achieve effective economic autonomy.[179] Nazi Germany similarly pursued an economic agenda with the aims of autarky and rearmament and imposed protectionist policies, including forcing the German steel industry to use lower-quality German iron ore rather than superior-quality imported iron.[180] In Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, both Mussolini and Hitler pursued territorial expansionist and interventionist foreign policy agendas from the 1930s through the 1940s culminating in World War II. Mussolini called for irredentist Italian claims to be reclaimed, establishing Italian domination of the Mediterranean Sea and securing Italian access to the Atlantic Ocean and the creation of Italian spazio vitale (""vital space"") in the Mediterranean and Red Sea regions.[181] Hitler called for irredentist German claims to be reclaimed along with the creation of German Lebensraum (""living space"") in Eastern Europe, including territories held by the Soviet Union, that would be colonized by Germans.[182] From 1935 to 1939, Germany and Italy escalated their demands for territorial claims and greater influence in world affairs. Italy invaded Ethiopia in 1935 resulting in its condemnation by the League of Nations and its widespread diplomatic isolation. In 1936, Germany remilitarized the industrial Rhineland, a region that had been ordered demilitarized by the Treaty of Versailles. In 1938, Germany annexed Austria and Italy assisted Germany in resolving the diplomatic crisis between Germany versus Britain and France over claims on Czechoslovakia by arranging the Munich Agreement that gave Germany the Sudetenland and was perceived at the time to have averted a European war. These hopes faded when Czechoslovakia was dissolved by the proclamation of the German client state of Slovakia, followed by the next day of the occupation of the remaining Czech Lands and the proclamation of the German Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. At the same time from 1938 to 1939, Italy was demanding territorial and colonial concessions from France and Britain.[183] In 1939, Germany prepared for war with Poland, but attempted to gain territorial concessions from Poland through diplomatic means.[184] The Polish government did not trust Hitler's promises and refused to accept Germany's demands.[184] The invasion of Poland by Germany was deemed unacceptable by Britain, France and their allies, resulting in their mutual declaration of war against Germany that was deemed the aggressor in the war in Poland, resulting in the outbreak of World War II. In 1940, Mussolini led Italy into World War II on the side of the Axis. Mussolini was aware that Italy did not have the military capacity to carry out a long war with France or the United Kingdom and waited until France was on the verge of imminent collapse and surrender from the German invasion before declaring war on France and the United Kingdom on 10 June 1940 on the assumption that the war would be short-lived following France's collapse.[185] Mussolini believed that following a brief entry of Italy into war with France, followed by the imminent French surrender, Italy could gain some territorial concessions from France and then concentrate its forces on a major offensive in Egypt where British and Commonwealth forces were outnumbered by Italian forces.[186] Plans by Germany to invade the United Kingdom in 1940 failed after Germany lost the aerial warfare campaign in the Battle of Britain. In 1941, the Axis campaign spread to the Soviet Union after Hitler launched Operation Barbarossa. Axis forces at the height of their power controlled almost all of continental Europe. The war became prolonged—contrary to Mussolini's plans—resulting in Italy losing battles on multiple fronts and requiring German assistance. During World War II, the Axis Powers in Europe led by Nazi Germany participated in the extermination of millions of Poles, Jews, Gypsies and others in the genocide known as the Holocaust. After 1942, Axis forces began to falter. In 1943, after Italy faced multiple military failures, the complete reliance and subordination of Italy to Germany, the Allied invasion of Italy and the corresponding international humiliation, Mussolini was removed as head of government and arrested on the order of King Victor Emmanuel III, who proceeded to dismantle the Fascist state and declared Italy's switching of allegiance to the Allied side. Mussolini was rescued from arrest by German forces and led the German client state, the Italian Social Republic from 1943 to 1945. Nazi Germany faced multiple losses and steady Soviet and Western Allied offensives from 1943 to 1945. On 28 April 1945, Mussolini was captured and executed by Italian communist partisans. On 30 April 1945, Hitler committed suicide. Shortly afterwards, Germany surrendered and the Nazi regime was systematically dismantled by the occupying Allied powers. An International Military Tribunal was subsequently convened in Nuremberg. Beginning in November 1945 and lasting through 1949, numerous Nazi political, military and economic leaders were tried and convicted of war crimes, with many of the worst offenders being sentenced to death and executed. The victory of the Allies over the Axis powers in World War II led to the collapse of many fascist regimes in Europe. The Nuremberg Trials convicted several Nazi leaders of crimes against humanity involving the Holocaust. However, there remained several movements and governments that were ideologically related to fascism. Francisco Franco's Falangist one-party state in Spain was officially neutral during World War II and it survived the collapse of the Axis Powers. Franco's rise to power had been directly assisted by the militaries of Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany during the Spanish Civil War and Franco had sent volunteers to fight on the side of Nazi Germany against the Soviet Union during World War II. The first years were characterized by a repression against the anti-fascist ideologies, deep censorship and the suppression of democratic institutions (elected Parliament, Spanish Constitution of 1931, Regional Statutes of Autonomy). After World War II and a period of international isolation, Franco's regime normalized relations with the Western powers during the Cold War, until Franco's death in 1975 and the transformation of Spain into a liberal democracy. Historian Robert Paxton observes that one of the main problems in defining fascism is that it was widely mimicked. Paxton says: ""In fascism's heyday, in the 1930s, many regimes that were not functionally fascist borrowed elements of fascist decor in order to lend themselves an aura of force, vitality, and mass mobilization."" He goes on to observe that Salazar ""crushed Portuguese fascism after he had copied some of its techniques of popular mobilization.""[187] Paxton says: ""Where Franco subjected Spain’s fascist party to his personal control, Salazar abolished outright in July 1934 the nearest thing Portugal had to an authentic fascist movement, Rolão Preto's blue-shirted National Syndicalists. ... Salazar preferred to control his population through such 'organic' institutions traditionally powerful in Portugal as the Church. Salazar's regime was not only non-fascist, but 'voluntarily non-totalitarian,' preferring to let those of its citizens who kept out of politics 'live by habit.'""[188] Historians tend to view the Estado Novo as para-fascist in nature,[189] possessing minimal fascist tendencies. [190] Other historians, including Fernando Rosas and Manuel Villaverde Cabral, think that the Estado Novo should be considered fascist.[191] In Argentina, Peronism, associated with the regime of Juan Perón from 1946 to 1955 and 1973 to 1974, was influenced by fascism.[192] Between 1939 and 1941, prior to his rise to power, Perón had developed a deep admiration of Italian Fascism and modelled his economic policies on Italian Fascist policies.[192] The term neo-fascism refers to fascist movements after World War II. In Italy, the Italian Social Movement led by Giorgio Almirante was a major neo-fascist movement that transformed itself into a self-described ""post-fascist"" movement called the National Alliance (AN), which has been an ally of Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia for a decade. In 2008, AN joined Forza Italia in Berlusconi's new party The People of Freedom, but in 2012 a group of politicians split from The People of Freedom, refounding the party with the name Brothers of Italy. In Germany, various neo-Nazi movements have been formed and banned in accordance with Germany's constitutional law which forbids Nazism. The National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD) is widely considered a neo-Nazi party, although the party does not publicly identify itself as such. After the onset of the Great Recession and economic crisis in Greece, a movement known as the Golden Dawn, widely considered a neo-Nazi party, soared in support out of obscurity and won seats in Greece's parliament, espousing a staunch hostility towards minorities, illegal immigrants and refugees. In 2013, after the murder of an anti-fascist musician by a person with links to Golden Dawn, the Greek government ordered the arrest of Golden Dawn's leader Nikolaos Michaloliakos and other Golden Dawn members on charges related to being associated with a criminal organization.[193][194] On 7 October 2020, Athens Appeals Court announced verdicts for 68 defendants, including the party's political leadership. Nikolaos Michaloliakos and six other prominent members and former MPs, were found guilty of running a criminal organization.[195] Guilty verdicts on charges of murder, attempted murder, and violent attacks on immigrants and left-wing political opponents were delivered.[196] Robert O. Paxton finds that even though fascism ""maintained the existing regime of property and social hierarchy,"" it cannot be considered ""simply a more muscular form of conservatism"" because ""fascism in power did carry out some changes profound enough to be called 'revolutionary.'""[197] These transformations ""often set fascists into conflict with conservatives rooted in families, churches, social rank, and property."" Paxton argues that ""fascism redrew the frontiers between private and public, sharply diminishing what had once been untouchably private. It changed the practice of citizenship from the enjoyment of constitutional rights and duties to participation in mass ceremonies of affirmation and conformity. It reconfigured relations between the individual and the collectivity, so that an individual had no rights outside community interest. It expanded the powers of the executive—party and state—in a bid for total control. Finally, it unleashed aggressive emotions hitherto known in Europe only during war or social revolution.""[197] Ultranationalism, combined with the myth of national rebirth, is a key foundation of fascism.[198] Robert Paxton argues that ""a passionate nationalism"" is the basis of fascism, combined with ""a conspiratorial and Manichean view of history"" which holds that ""the chosen people have been weakened by political parties, social classes, unassimilable minorities, spoiled rentiers, and rationalist thinkers.""[199] Roger Griffin identifies the core of fascism as being palingenetic ultranationalism.[37] The fascist view of a nation is of a single organic entity that binds people together by their ancestry and is a natural unifying force of people.[200] Fascism seeks to solve economic, political and social problems by achieving a millenarian national rebirth, exalting the nation or race above all else and promoting cults of unity, strength and purity.[44][201][202][203][204] European fascist movements typically espouse a racist conception of non-Europeans being inferior to Europeans.[205] Beyond this, fascists in Europe have not held a unified set of racial views.[205] Historically, most fascists promoted imperialism, although there have been several fascist movements that were uninterested in the pursuit of new imperial ambitions.[205] For example, Nazism and Italian Fascism were expansionist and irredentist. Falangism in Spain envisioned the worldwide unification of Spanish-speaking peoples (Hispanidad). British Fascism was non-interventionist, though it did embrace the British Empire. Fascism promotes the establishment of a totalitarian state.[206] It opposes liberal democracy, rejects multi-party systems, and may support a one-party state so that it may synthesize with the nation.[207] Mussolini's The Doctrine of Fascism (1932), partly ghostwritten by philosopher Giovanni Gentile,[208] who Mussolini described as ""the philosopher of Fascism"", states: ""The Fascist conception of the State is all-embracing; outside of it no human or spiritual values can exist, much less have value. Thus understood, Fascism is totalitarian, and the Fascist State—a synthesis and a unit inclusive of all values—interprets, develops, and potentiates the whole life of a people.""[209] In The Legal Basis of the Total State, Nazi political theorist Carl Schmitt described the Nazi intention to form a ""strong state which guarantees a totality of political unity transcending all diversity"" in order to avoid a ""disastrous pluralism tearing the German people apart.""[210] Fascist states pursued policies of social indoctrination through propaganda in education and the media, and regulation of the production of educational and media materials.[211][212] Education was designed to glorify the fascist movement and inform students of its historical and political importance to the nation. It attempted to purge ideas that were not consistent with the beliefs of the fascist movement and to teach students to be obedient to the state.[213] Fascism presented itself as an alternative to both international socialism and free-market capitalism.[214] While fascism opposed mainstream socialism, it sometimes regarded itself as a type of nationalist ""socialism"" to highlight their commitment to national solidarity and unity.[215][216] Fascists opposed international free market capitalism, but supported a type of productive capitalism.[120][217] Economic self-sufficiency, known as autarky, was a major goal of most fascist governments.[218] Fascist governments advocated resolution of domestic class conflict within a nation in order to secure national solidarity.[219] This would be done through the state mediating relations between the classes (contrary to the views of classical liberal-inspired capitalists).[220] While fascism was opposed to domestic class conflict, it was held that bourgeois-proletarian conflict existed primarily in national conflict between proletarian nations versus bourgeois nations.[221] Fascism condemned what it viewed as widespread character traits that it associated as the typical bourgeois mentality that it opposed, such as: materialism, crassness, cowardice and the inability to comprehend the heroic ideal of the fascist ""warrior""; and associations with liberalism, individualism and parliamentarianism.[222] In 1918, Mussolini defined what he viewed as the proletarian character, defining proletarian Fascism (/ˈfæʃɪzəm/) is a form of far-right, authoritarian ultranationalism[1][2] characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition, and strong regimentation of society and of the economy,[3] which came to prominence in early 20th-century Europe.[4] The first fascist movements emerged in Italy during World War I, before spreading to other European countries.[4] Opposed to anarchism, democracy, liberalism, and Marxism, fascism is placed on the far right-wing within the traditional left–right spectrum.[4][5][6] Fascists saw World War I as a revolution that brought massive changes to the nature of war, society, the state, and technology. The advent of total war and the total mass mobilization of society had broken down the distinction between civilians and combatants. A military citizenship arose in which all citizens were involved with the military in some manner during the war.[7][8] The war had resulted in the rise of a powerful state capable of mobilizing millions of people to serve on the front lines and providing economic production and logistics to support them, as well as having unprecedented authority to intervene in the lives of citizens.[7][8] Fascists believe that liberal democracy is obsolete and regard the complete mobilization of society under a totalitarian one-party state as necessary to prepare a nation for armed conflict and to respond effectively to economic difficulties.[9] A fascist state is led by a strong leader (such as a dictator) and a martial law government composed of the members of the governing fascist party to forge national unity and maintain a stable and orderly society.[9] Fascism rejects assertions that violence is automatically negative in nature and views imperialism, political violence and war as means that can achieve national rejuvenation.[10][11] Fascists advocate a mixed economy, with the principal goal of achieving autarky (national economic self-sufficiency) through protectionist and economic interventionist policies.[12] The extreme authoritarianism and nationalism of fascism often manifests a belief in racial purity or a master race, usually synthesized with some variant of racism or bigotry of a demonized ""Other""; the idea of racial purity has motivated fascist regimes to commit massacres, forced sterilizations, genocides, mass killings, or forced deportations against a perceived ""Other"".[13][14][15] Since the end of World War II in 1945, few parties have openly described themselves as fascist, and the term is instead now usually used pejoratively by political opponents. The descriptions of neo-fascist or post-fascist are sometimes applied more formally to describe contemporary parties of the far-right with ideologies similar to, or rooted in, 20th-century fascist movements.[4][16] The Italian term fascismo is derived from fascio, meaning 'bundle of sticks', ultimately from the Latin word fasces.[17] This was the name given to political organizations in Italy known as fasci, groups similar to guilds or syndicates. According to Italian fascist dictator Benito Mussolini's own account, the Fasces of Revolutionary Action were founded in Italy in 1915.[18] In 1919, Mussolini founded the Italian Fasces of Combat in Milan, which became the National Fascist Party two years later. The Fascists came to associate the term with the ancient Roman fasces or fascio littorio,[19] a bundle of rods tied around an axe,[20] an ancient Roman symbol of the authority of the civic magistrate[21] carried by his lictors, which could be used for corporal and capital punishment at his command.[22][23] The symbolism of the fasces suggested strength through unity: a single rod is easily broken, while the bundle is difficult to break.[24] Similar symbols were developed by different fascist movements: for example, the Falange symbol is five arrows joined together by a yoke.[25] Historians, political scientists, and other scholars have long debated the exact nature of fascism.[26] Historian Ian Kershaw once wrote that ""trying to define 'fascism' is like trying to nail jelly to the wall.""[27] Each different group described as fascist has at least some unique elements, and many definitions of fascism have been criticized as either too broad or too narrow.[28][29] According to many scholars, fascism—especially once in power—has historically attacked communism, conservatism, and parliamentary liberalism, attracting support primarily from the far right.[30] One common definition of the term, frequently cited by reliable sources as a standard definition, is that of historian Stanley G. Payne.[28] Payne's definition of fascism focuses on three concepts: In his book How Fascism Works: The Politics of Us and Them, Professor Jason Stanley observed: ""The leader proposes that only he can solve it and all of his political opponents are enemies or traitors."" Stanley says recent global events as of 2020[update], including the pandemic and the protests, have substantiated his concern about how fascist rhetoric is showing up in politics and policies around the world.[35] Historian John Lukacs argues that there is no such thing as generic fascism. He claims that Nazism and communism are essentially manifestations of populism and that states such as Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy are more different than similar.[36] Roger Griffin describes fascism as ""a genus of political ideology whose mythic core in its various permutations is a palingenetic form of populist ultranationalism.""[37] Griffin describes the ideology as having three core components: ""(i) the rebirth myth, (ii) populist ultra-nationalism, and (iii) the myth of decadence.""[38] In Griffin's view, fascism is ""a genuinely revolutionary, trans-class form of anti-liberal, and in the last analysis, anti-conservative nationalism"" built on a complex range of theoretical and cultural influences. He distinguishes an inter-war period in which it manifested itself in elite-led but populist ""armed party"" politics opposing socialism and liberalism, and promising radical politics to rescue the nation from decadence.[39] In Against the Fascist Creep, Alexander Reid Ross writes regarding Griffin's view: Following the Cold War and shifts in fascist organizing techniques, a number of scholars have moved toward the minimalist 'new consensus' refined by Roger Griffin: 'the mythic core' of fascism is 'a populist form of palingenetic ultranationalism.' That means that fascism is an ideology that draws on old, ancient, and even arcane myths of racial, cultural, ethnic, and national origins to develop a plan for the 'new man.'""[40] Griffin himself explored this 'mythic' or 'eliminable' core of fascism with his concept of post-fascism to explore the continuation of Nazism in the modern era.[41] Additionally, other historians have applied this minimalist core to explore proto-fascist movements.[42] Cas Mudde and Cristóbal Rovira Kaltwasser argue that although fascism ""flirted with populism ... in an attempt to generate mass support"", it is better seen as an elitist ideology. They cite in particular its exaltation of the Leader, the race, and the state, rather than the people. They see populism as a ""thin-centered ideology"" with a ""restricted morphology"" that necessarily becomes attached to ""thick-centered"" ideologies such as fascism, liberalism, or socialism. Thus populism can be found as an aspect of many specific ideologies, without necessarily being a defining characteristic of those ideologies. They refer to the combination of populism, authoritarianism and ultranationalism as ""a marriage of convenience.""[43] Robert Paxton says: ""[Fascism is] a form of political behavior marked by obsessive preoccupation with community decline, humiliation, or victimhood and by compensatory cults of unity, energy, and purity, in which a mass-based party of committed nationalist militants, working in uneasy but effective collaboration with traditional elites, abandons democratic liberties and pursues with redemptive violence and without ethical or legal restraints goals of internal cleansing and external expansion.""[44] Roger Eatwell defines fascism as ""an ideology that strives to forge social rebirth based on a holistic-national radical Third Way"",[45] while Walter Laqueur sees the core tenets of fascism as ""self-evident: nationalism; social Darwinism; racialism, the need for leadership, a new aristocracy, and obedience; and the negation of the ideals of the Enlightenment and the French Revolution.""[46] Racism was a key feature of German fascism, for which the Holocaust was a high priority. According to the historiography of genocide, ""In dealing with the Holocaust, it is the consensus of historians that Nazi Germany targeted Jews as a race, not as a religious group.""[47] Umberto Eco,[48] Kevin Passmore,[49] John Weiss,[50] Ian Adams,[51] and Moyra Grant[52] stress racism as a characteristic component of German fascism. Historian Robert Soucy stated that ""Hitler envisioned the ideal German society as a Volksgemeinschaft, a racially unified and hierarchically organized body in which the interests of individuals would be strictly subordinate to those of the nation, or Volk.""[53] Fascist philosophies vary by application, but remain distinct by one theoretical commonality: all traditionally fall into the far-right sector of any political spectrum, catalyzed by afflicted class identities over conventional social inequities.[4] Most scholars place fascism on the far right of the political spectrum.[4][5] Such scholarship focuses on its social conservatism and its authoritarian means of opposing egalitarianism.[54][55] Roderick Stackelberg places fascism—including Nazism, which he says is ""a radical variant of fascism""—on the political right by explaining: ""The more a person deems absolute equality among all people to be a desirable condition, the further left he or she will be on the ideological spectrum. The more a person considers inequality to be unavoidable or even desirable, the further to the right he or she will be.""[56] Fascism's origins are complex and include many seemingly contradictory viewpoints, ultimately centered around a mythos of national rebirth from decadence.[57] Fascism was founded during World War I by Italian national syndicalists who drew upon both left-wing organizational tactics and right-wing political views.[58] Italian Fascism gravitated to the right in the early 1920s.[59][60] A major element of fascist ideology that has been deemed to be far right is its stated goal to promote the right of a supposedly superior people to dominate, while purging society of supposedly inferior elements.[61] In the 1920s, the Italian Fascists described their ideology as right-wing in the political program The Doctrine of Fascism, stating: ""We are free to believe that this is the century of authority, a century tending to the 'right,' a fascist century.""[62][63] Mussolini stated that fascism's position on the political spectrum was not a serious issue for fascists: ""Fascism, sitting on the right, could also have sat on the mountain of the center. ... These words in any case do not have a fixed and unchanged meaning: they do have a variable subject to location, time and spirit. We don't give a damn about these empty terminologies and we despise those who are terrorized by these words.""[64] Major Italian groups politically on the right, especially rich landowners and big business, feared an uprising by groups on the left, such as sharecroppers and labour unions.[65] They welcomed Fascism and supported its violent suppression of opponents on the left.[66] The accommodation of the political right into the Italian Fascist movement in the early 1920s created internal factions within the movement. The ""Fascist left"" included Michele Bianchi, Giuseppe Bottai, Angelo Oliviero Olivetti, Sergio Panunzio, and Edmondo Rossoni, who were committed to advancing national syndicalism as a replacement for parliamentary liberalism in order to modernize the economy and advance the interests of workers and the common people.[67] The ""Fascist right"" included members of the paramilitary Blackshirts and former members of the Italian Nationalist Association (ANI).[67] The Blackshirts wanted to establish Fascism as a complete dictatorship, while the former ANI members, including Alfredo Rocco, sought to institute an authoritarian corporatist state to replace the liberal state in Italy while retaining the existing elites.[67] Upon accommodating the political right, there arose a group of monarchist fascists who sought to use fascism to create an absolute monarchy under King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy.[67] After the fall of the Fascist regime in Italy, when King Victor Emmanuel III forced Mussolini to resign as head of government and placed him under arrest in 1943, Mussolini was rescued by German forces. While continuing to rely on Germany for support, Mussolini and the remaining loyal Fascists founded the Italian Social Republic with Mussolini as head of state. Mussolini sought to re-radicalize Italian Fascism, declaring that the Fascist state had been overthrown because Italian Fascism had been subverted by Italian conservatives and the bourgeoisie.[68] Then the new Fascist government proposed the creation of workers' councils and profit-sharing in industry, although the German authorities, who effectively controlled northern Italy at this point, ignored these measures and did not seek to enforce them.[68] A number of post-World War II fascist movements described themselves as a Third Position outside the traditional political spectrum. Falange Española de las JONS leader José Antonio Primo de Rivera said: ""[B]asically the Right stands for the maintenance of an economic structure, albeit an unjust one, while the Left stands for the attempt to subvert that economic structure, even though the subversion thereof would entail the destruction of much that was worthwhile.""[69] The term fascist has been used as a pejorative,[70] regarding varying movements across the far right of the political spectrum.[71] George Orwell wrote in 1944 that ""the word 'Fascism' is almost entirely meaningless. ... almost any English person would accept 'bully' as a synonym for 'Fascist,'""[71] and in 1946 that ""...'Fascism' has now no meaning except in so far as it signifies something not desirable.""[72] Despite fascist movements' history of anti-communism, Communist states have sometimes been referred to as fascist, typically as an insult. It has been applied to Marxist–Leninist regimes in Cuba under Fidel Castro and Vietnam under Ho Chi Minh.[73] Chinese Marxists used the term to denounce the Soviet Union during the Sino-Soviet split, and the Soviets used the term to denounce Chinese Marxists[74] and social democracy, coining a new term in social fascism. In the United States, Herbert Matthews of The New York Times asked in 1946: ""Should we now place Stalinist Russia in the same category as Hitlerite Germany? Should we say that she is Fascist?""[75] J. Edgar Hoover, longtime FBI director and ardent anti-communist, wrote extensively of red fascism.[76] The Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s was sometimes called fascist. Historian Peter Amann states that, ""Undeniably, the Klan had some traits in common with European fascism—chauvinism, racism, a mystique of violence, an affirmation of a certain kind of archaic traditionalism—yet their differences were fundamental ... [the KKK] never envisioned a change of political or economic system.""[77] Professor Richard Griffiths of the University of Wales[78] wrote in 2005 that ""fascism"" is the ""most misused, and over-used word, of our times.""[29] ""Fascist"" is sometimes applied to post-World War II organizations and ways of thinking that academics more commonly term neo-fascist.[79] Georges Valois, founder of the first non-Italian fascist party Faisceau,[80] claimed the roots of fascism stemmed from the late 18th century Jacobin movement, seeing in its totalitarian nature a foreshadowing of the fascist state.[81] Historian George Mosse similarly analyzed fascism as an inheritor of the mass ideology and civil religion of the French Revolution, as well as a result of the brutalization of societies in 1914–1918.[81] Historians such as Irene Collins and Howard C Payne see Napoleon III, who ran a 'police state' and suppressed the media, as a forerunner of fascism.[82] According to David Thomson,[83] the Italian Risorgimento of 1871 led to the 'nemesis of fascism'. William L Shirer[84] sees a continuity from the views of Fichte and Hegel, through Bismarck, to Hitler; Robert Gerwarth speaks of a 'direct line' from Bismarck to Hitler.[85] Julian Dierkes sees fascism as a 'particularly violent form of imperialism'.[86] The historian Zeev Sternhell has traced the ideological roots of fascism back to the 1880s and in particular to the fin de siècle theme of that time.[87][88] The theme was based on a revolt against materialism, rationalism, positivism, bourgeois society, and democracy.[89] The fin-de-siècle generation supported emotionalism, irrationalism, subjectivism and vitalism.[90] They regarded civilization as being in crisis, requiring a massive and total solution.[89] Their intellectual school considered the individual as only one part of the larger collectivity, which should not be viewed as a numerical sum of atomized individuals.[89] They condemned the rationalistic, liberal individualism of society and the dissolution of social links in bourgeois society.[89] The fin-de-siècle outlook was influenced by various intellectual developments, including Darwinian biology, Gesamtkunstwerk, Arthur de Gobineau's racialism, Gustave Le Bon's psychology, and the philosophies of Friedrich Nietzsche, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, and Henri Bergson.[91] Social Darwinism, which gained widespread acceptance, made no distinction between physical and social life, and viewed the human condition as being an unceasing struggle to achieve the survival of the fittest.[91] It challenged positivism's claim of deliberate and rational choice as the determining behaviour of humans, with social Darwinism focusing on heredity, race, and environment.[91] Its emphasis on biogroup identity and the role of organic relations within societies fostered the legitimacy and appeal of nationalism.[92] New theories of social and political psychology also rejected the notion of human behaviour being governed by rational choice and instead claimed that emotion was more influential in political issues than reason.[91] Nietzsche's argument that ""God is dead"" coincided with his attack on the ""herd mentality"" of Christianity, democracy, and modern collectivism, his concept of the Übermensch, and his advocacy of the will to power as a primordial instinct, were major influences upon many of the fin-de-siècle generation.[93] Bergson's claim of the existence of an élan vital, or vital instinct, centred upon free choice and rejected the processes of materialism and determinism; this challenged Marxism.[94] In his work The Ruling Class (1896), Gaetano Mosca developed the theory that claims that in all societies an ""organized minority"" would dominate and rule over an ""disorganized majority"",[95][96] stating that there are only two classes in society, ""the governing"" (the organized minority) and ""the governed"" (the disorganized majority).[97] He claims that the organized nature of the organized minority makes it irresistible to any individual of the disorganized majority.[97] French nationalist and reactionary monarchist Charles Maurras influenced fascism.[98] Maurras promoted what he called integral nationalism, which called for the organic unity of a nation, and insisted that a powerful monarch was an ideal leader of a nation. Maurras distrusted what he considered the democratic mystification of the popular will that created an impersonal collective subject.[98] He claimed that a powerful monarch was a personified sovereign who could exercise authority to unite a nation's people.[98] Maurras' integral nationalism was idealized by fascists, but modified into a modernized revolutionary form that was devoid of Maurras' monarchism.[98] French revolutionary syndicalist Georges Sorel promoted the legitimacy of political violence in his work Reflections on Violence (1908) and other works in which he advocated radical syndicalist action to achieve a revolution to overthrow capitalism and the bourgeoisie through a general strike.[99] In Reflections on Violence, Sorel emphasized need for a revolutionary political religion.[100] Also in his work The Illusions of Progress, Sorel denounced democracy as reactionary, saying ""nothing is more aristocratic than democracy.""[101] By 1909, after the failure of a syndicalist general strike in France, Sorel and his supporters left the radical left and went to the radical right, where they sought to merge militant Catholicism and French patriotism with their views—advocating anti-republican Christian French patriots as ideal revolutionaries.[102] Initially, Sorel had officially been a revisionist of Marxism, but by 1910 announced his abandonment of socialist literature and claimed in 1914, using an aphorism of Benedetto Croce that ""socialism is dead"" because of the ""decomposition of Marxism.""[103] Sorel became a supporter of reactionary Maurrassian nationalism beginning in 1909 that influenced his works.[103] Maurras held interest in merging his nationalist ideals with Sorelian syndicalism, known as Sorelianism, as a means to confront democracy.[104] Maurras stated that ""a socialism liberated from the democratic and cosmopolitan element fits nationalism well as a well made glove fits a beautiful hand.""[105] The fusion of Maurrassian nationalism and Sorelian syndicalism influenced radical Italian nationalist Enrico Corradini.[106] Corradini spoke of the need for a nationalist-syndicalist movement, led by elitist aristocrats and anti-democrats who shared a revolutionary syndicalist commitment to direct action and a willingness to fight.[106] Corradini spoke of Italy as being a ""proletarian nation"" that needed to pursue imperialism in order to challenge the ""plutocratic"" French and British.[107] Corradini's views were part of a wider set of perceptions within the right-wing Italian Nationalist Association (ANI), which claimed that Italy's economic backwardness was caused by corruption in its political class, liberalism, and division caused by ""ignoble socialism"".[107] The ANI held ties and influence among conservatives, Catholics, and the business community.[107] Italian national syndicalists held a common set of principles: the rejection of bourgeois values, democracy, liberalism, Marxism, internationalism, and pacifism, and the promotion of heroism, vitalism, and violence.[108] The ANI claimed that liberal democracy was no longer compatible with the modern world, and advocated a strong state and imperialism. They believed that humans are naturally predatory, and that nations are in a constant struggle in which only the strongest would survive.[109] Futurism was both an artistic-cultural movement and initially a political movement in Italy led by Filippo Tommaso Marinetti who founded the Manifesto of Futurism (1908), that championed the causes of modernism, action, and political violence as necessary elements of politics while denouncing liberalism and parliamentary politics. Marinetti rejected conventional democracy based on majority rule and egalitarianism, for a new form of democracy, promoting what he described in his work ""The Futurist Conception of Democracy"" as the following: ""We are therefore able to give the directions to create and to dismantle to numbers, to quantity, to the mass, for with us number, quantity and mass will never be—as they are in Germany and Russia—the number, quantity and mass of mediocre men, incapable and indecisive.""[110] Futurism influenced fascism in its emphasis on recognizing the virile nature of violent action and war as being necessities of modern civilization.[111] Marinetti promoted the need of physical training of young men saying that, in male education, gymnastics should take precedence over books. He advocated segregation of the genders because womanly sensibility must not enter men's education, which he claimed must be ""lively, bellicose, muscular and violently dynamic.""[112] At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, the Italian political left became severely split over its position on the war. The Italian Socialist Party (PSI) opposed the war but a number of Italian revolutionary syndicalists supported war against Germany and Austria-Hungary on the grounds that their reactionary regimes had to be defeated to ensure the success of socialism.[113] Angelo Oliviero Olivetti formed a pro-interventionist fascio called the Revolutionary Fasces of International Action in October 1914.[113] Benito Mussolini upon being expelled from his position as chief editor of the PSI's newspaper Avanti! for his anti-German stance, joined the interventionist cause in a separate fascio.[114] The term ""Fascism"" was first used in 1915 by members of Mussolini's movement, the Fasces of Revolutionary Action.[115] The first meeting of the Fasces of Revolutionary Action was held on 24 January 1915[116] when Mussolini declared that it was necessary for Europe to resolve its national problems—including national borders—of Italy and elsewhere ""for the ideals of justice and liberty for which oppressed peoples must acquire the right to belong to those national communities from which they descended.""[116] Attempts to hold mass meetings were ineffective and the organization was regularly harassed by government authorities and socialists.[117] Similar political ideas arose in Germany after the outbreak of the war. German sociologist Johann Plenge spoke of the rise of a ""National Socialism"" in Germany within what he termed the ""ideas of 1914"" that were a declaration of war against the ""ideas of 1789"" (the French Revolution).[118] According to Plenge, the ""ideas of 1789""—such as the rights of man, democracy, individualism and liberalism—were being rejected in favor of ""the ideas of 1914"" that included ""German values"" of duty, discipline, law and order.[118] Plenge believed that racial solidarity (Volksgemeinschaft) would replace class division and that ""racial comrades"" would unite to create a socialist society in the struggle of ""proletarian"" Germany against ""capitalist"" Britain.[118] He believed that the Spirit of 1914 manifested itself in the concept of the People's League of National Socialism.[119] This National Socialism was a form of state socialism that rejected the ""idea of boundless freedom"" and promoted an economy that would serve the whole of Germany under the leadership of the state.[119] This National Socialism was opposed to capitalism because of the components that were against ""the national interest"" of Germany but insisted that National Socialism would strive for greater efficiency in the economy.[119][120] Plenge advocated an authoritarian rational ruling elite to develop National Socialism through a hierarchical technocratic state.[121] Fascists viewed World War I as bringing revolutionary changes in the nature of war, society, the state and technology, as the advent of total war and mass mobilization had broken down the distinction between civilian and combatant, as civilians had become a critical part in economic production for the war effort and thus arose a ""military citizenship"" in which all citizens were involved to the military in some manner during the war.[7][8] World War I had resulted in the rise of a powerful state capable of mobilizing millions of people to serve on the front lines or provide economic production and logistics to support those on the front lines, as well as having unprecedented authority to intervene in the lives of citizens.[7][8] Fascists viewed technological developments of weaponry and the state's total mobilization of its population in the war as symbolizing the beginning of a new era fusing state power with mass politics, technology and particularly the mobilizing myth that they contended had triumphed over the myth of progress and the era of liberalism.[7] The October Revolution of 1917, in which Bolshevik communists led by Vladimir Lenin seized power in Russia, greatly influenced the development of fascism.[122] In 1917, Mussolini, as leader of the Fasces of Revolutionary Action, praised the October Revolution, but later he became unimpressed with Lenin, regarding him as merely a new version of Tsar Nicholas II.[123] After World War I, fascists commonly campaigned on anti-Marxist agendas.[122] Liberal opponents of both fascism and the Bolsheviks argue that there are various similarities between the two, including that they believed in the necessity of a vanguard leadership, had disdain for bourgeois values, and it is argued had totalitarian ambitions.[122] In practice, both have commonly emphasized revolutionary action, proletarian nation theories, one-party states, and party-armies;[122] however, both draw clear distinctions from each other both in aims and tactics, with the Bolsheviks emphasizing the need for an organized participatory democracy (Soviet democracy) and an egalitarian, internationalist vision for society based on proletarian internationalism, while fascists emphasized hyper-nationalism and open hostility towards democracy, envisioning a hierarchical social structure as essential to their aims. With the antagonism between anti-interventionist Marxists and pro-interventionist Fascists complete by the end of the war, the two sides became irreconcilable. The Fascists presented themselves as anti-communists and as especially opposed to the Marxists.[124] In 1919, Mussolini consolidated control over the Fascist movement, known as Sansepolcrismo, with the founding of the Italian Fasces of Combat.[66] In 1919, Alceste De Ambris and futurist movement leader Filippo Tommaso Marinetti created ""The Manifesto of the Italian Fasces of Combat"".[125] The Fascist Manifesto was presented on 6 June 1919 in the Fascist newspaper Il Popolo d'Italia and supported the creation of universal suffrage, including women's suffrage (the latter being realized only partly in late 1925, with all opposition parties banned or disbanded);[126] proportional representation on a regional basis; government representation through a corporatist system of ""National Councils"" of experts, selected from professionals and tradespeople, elected to represent and hold legislative power over their respective areas, including labour, industry, transportation, public health, and communications, among others; and abolition of the Senate of the Kingdom of Italy.[127] The Fascist Manifesto supported the creation of an eight-hour work day for all workers, a minimum wage, worker representation in industrial management, equal confidence in labour unions as in industrial executives and public servants, reorganization of the transportation sector, revision of the draft law on invalidity insurance, reduction of the retirement age from 65 to 55, a strong progressive tax on capital, confiscation of the property of religious institutions and abolishment of bishoprics, and revision of military contracts to allow the government to seize 85% of profits.[128] It also called for the fulfillment of expansionist aims in the Balkans and other parts of the Mediterranean,[129] the creation of a short-service national militia to serve defensive duties, nationalization of the armaments industry, and a foreign policy designed to be peaceful but also competitive.[130] The next events that influenced the Fascists in Italy was the raid of Fiume by Italian nationalist Gabriele d'Annunzio and the founding of the Charter of Carnaro in 1920.[131] D'Annunzio and De Ambris designed the Charter, which advocated national-syndicalist corporatist productionism alongside D'Annunzio's political views.[132]   as being one and the same with producers, a productivist perspective that associated all people deemed productive, including entrepreneurs, technicians, workers and soldiers as being proletarian.[223] He acknowledged the historical existence of both bourgeois and proletarian producers but declared the need for bourgeois producers to merge with proletarian producers.[223] While fascism denounced the mainstream internationalist and Marxist socialisms, it claimed to economically represent a type of nationalist productivist socialism that while condemning parasitical capitalism, it was willing to accommodate productivist capitalism within it.[217] This was derived from Henri de Saint Simon, whose ideas inspired the creation of utopian socialism and influenced other ideologies, that stressed solidarity rather than class war and whose conception of productive people in the economy included both productive workers and productive bosses to challenge the influence of the aristocracy and unproductive financial speculators.[224] Saint Simon's vision combined the traditionalist right-wing criticisms of the French Revolution with a left-wing belief in the need for association or collaboration of productive people in society.[224] Whereas Marxism condemned capitalism as a system of exploitative property relations, fascism saw the nature of the control of credit and money in the contemporary capitalist system as abusive.[217] Unlike Marxism, fascism did not see class conflict between the Marxist-defined proletariat and the bourgeoisie as a given or as an engine of historical materialism.[217] Instead, it viewed workers and productive capitalists in common as productive people who were in conflict with parasitic elements in society including: corrupt political parties, corrupt financial capital and feeble people.[217] Fascist leaders such as Mussolini and Hitler spoke of the need to create a new managerial elite led by engineers and captains of industry—but free from the parasitic leadership of industries.[217] Hitler stated that the Nazi Party supported bodenständigen Kapitalismus (""productive capitalism"") that was based upon profit earned from one's own labour, but condemned unproductive capitalism or loan capitalism, which derived profit from speculation.[225] Fascist economics supported a state-controlled economy that accepted a mix of private and public ownership over the means of production.[226] Economic planning was applied to both the public and private sector and the prosperity of private enterprise depended on its acceptance of synchronizing itself with the economic goals of the state.[227] Fascist economic ideology supported the profit motive, but emphasized that industries must uphold the national interest as superior to private profit.[227] While fascism accepted the importance of material wealth and power, it condemned materialism which identified as being present in both communism and capitalism and criticized materialism for lacking acknowledgement of the role of the spirit.[228] In particular, fascists criticized capitalism, not because of its competitive nature nor support of private property, which fascists supported—but due to its materialism, individualism, alleged bourgeois decadence and alleged indifference to the nation.[229] Fascism denounced Marxism for its advocacy of materialist internationalist class identity, which fascists regarded as an attack upon the emotional and spiritual bonds of the nation and a threat to the achievement of genuine national solidarity.[230] In discussing the spread of fascism beyond Italy, historian Philip Morgan states: ""Since the Depression was a crisis of laissez-faire capitalism and its political counterpart, parliamentary democracy, fascism could pose as the 'third-way' alternative between capitalism and Bolshevism, the model of a new European 'civilization.' As Mussolini typically put it in early 1934, 'from 1929 ... fascism has become a universal phenomenon ... The dominant forces of the 19th century, democracy, socialism, [and] liberalism have been exhausted ... the new political and economic forms of the twentieth-century are fascist' (Mussolini 1935: 32).""[166] Fascists criticized egalitarianism as preserving the weak, and they instead promoted social Darwinist views and policies.[231][232] They were in principle opposed to the idea of social welfare, arguing that it ""encouraged the preservation of the degenerate and the feeble.""[233] The Nazi Party condemned the welfare system of the Weimar Republic, as well as private charity and philanthropy, for supporting people whom they regarded as racially inferior and weak, and who should have been weeded out in the process of natural selection.[234] Nevertheless, faced with the mass unemployment and poverty of the Great Depression, the Nazis found it necessary to set up charitable institutions to help racially-pure Germans in order to maintain popular support, while arguing that this represented ""racial self-help"" and not indiscriminate charity or universal social welfare.[235] Thus, Nazi programs such as the Winter Relief of the German People and the broader National Socialist People's Welfare (NSV) were organized as quasi-private institutions, officially relying on private donations from Germans to help others of their race—although in practice those who refused to donate could face severe consequences.[236] Unlike the social welfare institutions of the Weimar Republic and the Christian charities, the NSV distributed assistance on explicitly racial grounds. It provided support only to those who were ""racially sound, capable of and willing to work, politically reliable, and willing and able to reproduce."" Non-Aryans were excluded, as well as the ""work-shy"", ""asocials"" and the ""hereditarily ill.""[237] Under these conditions, by 1939, over 17 million Germans had obtained assistance from the NSV, and the agency ""projected a powerful image of caring and support"" for ""those who were judged to have got into difficulties through no fault of their own.""[237] Yet the organization was ""feared and disliked among society's poorest"" because it resorted to intrusive questioning and monitoring to judge who was worthy of support.[238] Fascism emphasizes direct action, including supporting the legitimacy of political violence, as a core part of its politics.[11][239] Fascism views violent action as a necessity in politics that fascism identifies as being an ""endless struggle"";[240] this emphasis on the use of political violence means that most fascist parties have also created their own private militias (e.g. the Nazi Party's Brown shirts and Fascist Italy's Blackshirts). The basis of fascism's support of violent action in politics is connected to social Darwinism.[240] Fascist movements have commonly held social Darwinist views of nations, races and societies.[241] They say that nations and races must purge themselves of socially and biologically weak or degenerate people, while simultaneously promoting the creation of strong people, in order to survive in a world defined by perpetual national and racial conflict.[242] Fascism emphasizes youth both in a physical sense of age and in a spiritual sense as related to virility and commitment to action.[243] The Italian Fascists' political anthem was called Giovinezza (""The Youth"").[243] Fascism identifies the physical age period of youth as a critical time for the moral development of people who will affect society.[244] Walter Laqueur argues that ""[t]he corollaries of the cult of war and physical danger were the cult of brutality, strength, and sexuality ... [fascism is] a true counter-civilization: rejecting the sophisticated rationalist humanism of Old Europe, fascism sets up as its ideal the primitive instincts and primal emotions of the barbarian.""[245] Italian Fascism pursued what it called ""moral hygiene"" of youth, particularly regarding sexuality.[246] Fascist Italy promoted what it considered normal sexual behaviour in youth while denouncing what it considered deviant sexual behaviour.[246] It condemned pornography, most forms of birth control and contraceptive devices (with the exception of the condom), homosexuality and prostitution as deviant sexual behaviour, although enforcement of laws opposed to such practices was erratic and authorities often turned a blind eye.[246] Fascist Italy regarded the promotion of male sexual excitation before puberty as the cause of criminality amongst male youth, declared homosexuality a social disease and pursued an aggressive campaign to reduce prostitution of young women.[246] Mussolini perceived women's primary role as primarily child bearers, while that of men as warriors, once saying: ""War is to man what maternity is to the woman.""[247] In an effort to increase birthrates, the Italian Fascist government gave financial incentives to women who raised large families and initiated policies intended to reduce the number of women employed.[248] Italian Fascism called for women to be honoured as ""reproducers of the nation"" and the Italian Fascist government held ritual ceremonies to honour women's role within the Italian nation.[249] In 1934, Mussolini declared that employment of women was a ""major aspect of the thorny problem of unemployment"" and that for women, working was ""incompatible with childbearing""; Mussolini went on to say that the solution to unemployment for men was the ""exodus of women from the work force.""[250] The German Nazi government strongly encouraged women to stay at home to bear children and keep house.[251] This policy was reinforced by bestowing the Cross of Honor of the German Mother on women bearing four or more children. The unemployment rate was cut substantially, mostly through arms production and sending women home so that men could take their jobs. Nazi propaganda sometimes promoted premarital and extramarital sexual relations, unwed motherhood and divorce, but at other times the Nazis opposed such behaviour.[252] The Nazis decriminalized abortion in cases where fetuses had hereditary defects or were of a race the government disapproved of, while the abortion of healthy pure German, Aryan fetuses remained strictly forbidden.[253] For non-Aryans, abortion was often compulsory. Their eugenics program also stemmed from the ""progressive biomedical model"" of Weimar Germany.[254] In 1935, Nazi Germany expanded the legality of abortion by amending its eugenics law, to promote abortion for women with hereditary disorders.[253] The law allowed abortion if a woman gave her permission and the fetus was not yet viable[255][256] and for purposes of so-called racial hygiene.[257][258] The Nazis said that homosexuality was degenerate, effeminate, perverted and undermined masculinity because it did not produce children.[259] They considered homosexuality curable through therapy, citing modern scientism and the study of sexology, which said that homosexuality could be felt by ""normal"" people and not just an abnormal minority.[260] Open homosexuals were interned in Nazi concentration camps.[261] Fascism emphasizes both palingenesis (national rebirth or re-creation) and modernism.[262] In particular, fascism's nationalism has been identified as having a palingenetic character.[198] Fascism promotes the regeneration of the nation and purging it of decadence.[262] Fascism accepts forms of modernism that it deems promotes national regeneration while rejecting forms of modernism that are regarded as antithetical to national regeneration.[263] Fascism aestheticized modern technology and its association with speed, power and violence.[264] Fascism admired advances in the economy in the early 20th century, particularly Fordism and scientific management.[265] Fascist modernism has been recognized as inspired or developed by various figures—such as Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, Ernst Jünger, Gottfried Benn, Louis-Ferdinand Céline, Knut Hamsun, Ezra Pound and Wyndham Lewis.[266] In Italy, such modernist influence was exemplified by Marinetti who advocated a palingenetic modernist society that condemned liberal-bourgeois values of tradition and psychology, while promoting a technological-martial religion of national renewal that emphasized militant nationalism.[267] In Germany, it was exemplified by Jünger who was influenced by his observation of the technological warfare during World War I and claimed that a new social class had been created that he described as the ""warrior-worker"";[268] Like Marinetti, Jünger emphasized the revolutionary capacities of technology. He emphasized an ""organic construction"" between human and machine as a liberating and regenerative force that challenged liberal democracy, conceptions of individual autonomy, bourgeois nihilism and decadence.[268] He conceived of a society based on a totalitarian concept of ""total mobilization"" of such disciplined warrior-workers.[268] According to cultural critic Susan Sontag, ""[f]ascist aesthetics ... flow from (and justify) a preoccupation with situations of control, submissive behavior, extravagant effort, and the endurance of pain; they endorse two seemingly opposite states, egomania and servitude. The relations of domination and enslavement take the form of a characteristic pageantry: the massing of groups of people; the turning of people into things; the multiplication or replication of things; and the grouping of people/things around an all-powerful, hypnotic leader-figure or force. The fascist dramaturgy centers on the orgiastic transactions between mighty forces and their puppets, uniformly garbed and shown in ever swelling numbers. Its choreography alternates between ceaseless motion and a congealed, static, 'virile' posing. Fascist art glorifies surrender, it exalts mindlessness, it glamorizes death.""[269] Sontag also enumerates some commonalities between fascist art and the official art of communist countries, such as the obeisance of the masses to the hero, and a preference for the monumental and the ""grandiose and rigid"" choreography of mass bodies. But whereas official communist art ""aims to expound and reinforce a utopian morality"", the art of fascist countries such as Nazi Germany ""displays a utopian aesthetics – that of physical perfection"", in a way that is ""both prurient and idealizing.""[269] According to Sontag, fascist aesthetics ""is based on the containment of vital forces; movements are confined, held tight, held in."" Its appeal is not necessarily limited to those who share the fascist political ideology because fascism ""stands for an ideal or rather ideals that are persistent today under the other banners: the ideal of life as art, the cult of beauty, the fetishism of courage, the dissolution of alienation in ecstatic feelings of community; the repudiation of the intellect; the family of man (under the parenthood of leaders).""[269] Fascism has been widely criticized and condemned in modern times since the defeat of the Axis Powers in World War II. One of the most common and strongest criticisms of fascism is that it is a tyranny.[270] Fascism is deliberately and entirely non-democratic and anti-democratic.[271][272][273] Some critics of Italian fascism have said that much of the ideology was merely a by-product of unprincipled opportunism by Mussolini and that he changed his political stances merely to bolster his personal ambitions while he disguised them as being purposeful to the public.[274] Richard Washburn Child, the American ambassador to Italy who worked with Mussolini and became his friend and admirer, defended Mussolini's opportunistic behaviour by writing: ""Opportunist is a term of reproach used to brand men who fit themselves to conditions for the reasons of self-interest. Mussolini, as I have learned to know him, is an opportunist in the sense that he believed that mankind itself must be fitted to changing conditions rather than to fixed theories, no matter how many hopes and prayers have been expended on theories and programmes.""[275] Child quoted Mussolini as saying: ""The sanctity of an ism is not in the ism; it has no sanctity beyond its power to do, to work, to succeed in practice. It may have succeeded yesterday and fail to-morrow. Failed yesterday and succeed to-morrow. The machine, first of all, must run!""[275] Some have criticized Mussolini's actions during the outbreak of World War I as opportunistic for seeming to suddenly abandon Marxist egalitarian internationalism for non-egalitarian nationalism and note, to that effect, that upon Mussolini endorsing Italy's intervention in the war against Germany and Austria-Hungary, he and the new fascist movement received financial support from Italian and foreign sources, such as Ansaldo (an armaments firm) and other companies[276] as well as the British Security Service MI5.[277] Some, including Mussolini's socialist opponents at the time, have noted that regardless of the financial support he accepted for his pro-interventionist stance, Mussolini was free to write whatever he wished in his newspaper Il Popolo d'Italia without prior sanctioning from his financial backers.[278] Furthermore, the major source of financial support that Mussolini and the fascist movement received in World War I was from France and is widely believed to have been French socialists who supported the French government's war against Germany and who sent support to Italian socialists who wanted Italian intervention on France's side.[279] Mussolini's transformation away from Marxism into what eventually became fascism began prior to World War I, as Mussolini had grown increasingly pessimistic about Marxism and egalitarianism while becoming increasingly supportive of figures who opposed egalitarianism, such as Friedrich Nietzsche.[280] By 1902, Mussolini was studying Georges Sorel, Nietzsche and Vilfredo Pareto.[281] Sorel's emphasis on the need for overthrowing decadent liberal democracy and capitalism by the use of violence, direct action, general strikes and neo-Machiavellian appeals to emotion impressed Mussolini deeply.[282] Mussolini's use of Nietzsche made him a highly unorthodox socialist, due to Nietzsche's promotion of elitism and anti-egalitarian views.[280] Prior to World War I, Mussolini's writings over time indicated that he had abandoned the Marxism and egalitarianism that he had previously supported in favour of Nietzsche's übermensch concept and anti-egalitarianism.[280] In 1908, Mussolini wrote a short essay called ""Philosophy of Strength"" based on his Nietzschean influence, in which Mussolini openly spoke fondly of the ramifications of an impending war in Europe in challenging both religion and nihilism: ""[A] new kind of free spirit will come, strengthened by the war, ... a spirit equipped with a kind of sublime perversity, ... a new free spirit will triumph over God and over Nothing.""[111] Fascism has been criticized for being ideologically dishonest. Major examples of ideological dishonesty have been identified in Italian fascism's changing relationship with German Nazism.[283][284] Fascist Italy's official foreign policy positions were known to commonly utilize rhetorical ideological hyperbole to justify its actions, although during Dino Grandi's tenure as Italy's foreign minister the country engaged in realpolitik free of such fascist hyperbole.[285] Italian fascism's stance towards German Nazism fluctuated from support from the late 1920s to 1934, when it celebrated Hitler's rise to power and Mussolini's first meeting with Hitler in 1934; to opposition from 1934 to 1936 after the assassination of Italy's allied leader in Austria, Engelbert Dollfuss, by Austrian Nazis; and again back to support after 1936, when Germany was the only significant power that did not denounce Italy's invasion and occupation of Ethiopia. After antagonism exploded between Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy over the assassination of Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss in 1934, Mussolini and Italian fascists denounced and ridiculed Nazism's racial theories, particularly by denouncing its Nordicism, while promoting Mediterraneanism.[284] Mussolini himself responded to Nordicists' claims of Italy being divided into Nordic and Mediterranean racial areas due to Germanic invasions of Northern Italy by claiming that while Germanic tribes such as the Lombards took control of Italy after the fall of Ancient Rome, they arrived in small numbers (about 8,000) and quickly assimilated into Roman culture and spoke the Latin language within fifty years.[286] Italian fascism was influenced by the tradition of Italian nationalists scornfully looking down upon Nordicists' claims and taking pride in comparing the age and sophistication of ancient Roman civilization as well as the classical revival in the Renaissance to that of Nordic societies that Italian nationalists described as ""newcomers"" to civilization in comparison.[283] At the height of antagonism between the Nazis and Italian fascists over race, Mussolini claimed that the Germans themselves were not a pure race and noted with irony that the Nazi theory of German racial superiority was based on the theories of non-German foreigners, such as Frenchman Arthur de Gobineau.[287] After the tension in German-Italian relations diminished during the late 1930s, Italian fascism sought to harmonize its ideology with German Nazism and combined Nordicist and Mediterranean racial theories, noting that Italians were members of the Aryan Race, composed of a mixed Nordic-Mediterranean subtype.[284] In 1938, Mussolini declared upon Italy's adoption of antisemitic laws that Italian fascism had always been antisemitic,[284] In fact, Italian fascism did not endorse antisemitism until the late 1930s when Mussolini feared alienating antisemitic Nazi Germany, whose power and influence were growing in Europe. Prior to that period, there had been notable Jewish Italians who had been senior Italian fascist officials, including Margherita Sarfatti, who had also been Mussolini's mistress.[284] Also contrary to Mussolini's claim in 1938, only a small number of Italian fascists were staunchly antisemitic (such as Roberto Farinacci and Giuseppe Preziosi), while others such as Italo Balbo, who came from Ferrara which had one of Italy's largest Jewish communities, were disgusted by the antisemitic laws and opposed them.[284] Fascism scholar Mark Neocleous notes that while Italian fascism did not have a clear commitment to antisemitism, there were occasional antisemitic statements issued prior to 1938, such as Mussolini in 1919 declaring that the Jewish bankers in London and New York were connected by race to the Russian Bolsheviks and that eight percent of the Russian Bolsheviks were Jews.[288] Notes Bibliography Further reading"

And like President Jimmy Carter, PresidentBarack Obama has restricted traditional domestic energy development at every turn. According to the Energy Information Administration, President Obama’s Gulf drilling moratorium will cause domestic offshore oil production to fall 13% this year . Absent the Obama moratorium, the EIA had predicted a 6% increase in offshore production from 2010 levels. That means President Obama’s Gulf moratorium alone will cost American consumers 220,000 barrels of domestic oil production a day. But President Obama is not against all offshore oil drilling. When other countries are the ones developing their natural resources, President Obama is all for it. This Sunday in Brazil, President Obama highlighted that country’s recent offshore oil discoveries: “We want to help you with the technology and support to develop these oil reserves safely, and when you’re ready to start selling, we want to be one of your best customers.” As Steve Forbes recently warned: “The Obama Administration is repeating the mistakes of President Jimmy Carter’s failed energy policies, which marred his term and stigmatized the 1970s.

"Sign In Anti-growth agenda results in historic levels of malaise Manage Newsletters Shameless politicians use 9/11 to lecture America about “unity” Biden’s forced COVID-19 vaccine attack on minorities Dems’ totalitarian overreach threatens Americans’ livelihood White(wash) House ANALYSIS/OPINION: Consumers are more depressed about the economy than they have ever been in the past three decades, according to a Reuters-University of Michigan consumer-confidence survey released Friday. The nosedive in the national mood is most striking in the fact that only 21 percent think better times are coming in the year ahead. A rudderless administration presiding over the expansion of counterproductive leftist public policies has suffocated hope. The survey’s chief economist, Richard Curtin, pinned the sour attitude on three specific factors: the rise in gas prices, more expensive food and the widespread understanding that real incomes are going to remain flat. As has been widely discussed, the Obama administration’s anti-drilling policies have thwarted development of America’s vast oil reserves, ensuring this country remains unnecessarily dependent upon unstable foreign sources of crude. That makes things more expensive at the pump, but longer-term forces are also at work. Since 1995, car-hating liberals claiming to be saviors of the environment have required refiners to produce dozens of “boutique” fuel blends that change based on region and season. Previously, the Environmental Protection Agency mandated use of a substance known as MTBE to adulterate gasoline and create these blends. Never mind that this groundwater-polluting additive is a carcinogen. Ethanol has mostly supplanted MTBE, transferring billions out of the pockets of drivers and into the hands of large agribusiness firms like Archer Daniels Midland, the largest producer of the corn-based substance. With the government lavishing subsidies on this useless product, less crop land is available for food production. That not only drives up the cost of corn flakes but beef and all the other products that depend on corn for feed.

Instead, they hear lectures about “the rich” and the need for more stimulus. The public isn’t buying. Only 31 percent of likely voters believed Mr. Obama has been doing a good job with the economy in a March 20 Rasmussen Reports survey. Mr. Obama gives off the impression that he is confused as to why the policy plays of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Jimmy Carter and discredited economist John Maynard Keynes haven’t paid off. To the contrary, instead of generating more wealth year after year, America ended 2010 roughly with the same real gross domestic product we had at the close of 2007, according to figures released Friday by the Commerce Department. There are positive signs, but three years have been lost. The most upbeat news is that Mr. Obama’s spending spree has come to an official end. After boosting outlays 8.8 percent in 2010’s third quarter, federal spending dipped 0.3 percent in the fourth, according to the department’s figures. Local and state governments likewise had no choice but to reduce overall spending by 1.4 percent. Less government gives the private sector more room to recover and expand, but that tiny rollback is nowhere near what’s needed to put the country back on the road to prosperity. House Republicans need to draw a line in the sand and refuse to continue on the path of borrowing trillions from future generations to pay for today’s bureaucracy. So far, the GOP strategy of short-term budget extensions with noncontroversial cuts in spending has only put off the inevitable showdown between the two competing visions for the country’s future. The Keynesian model has failed once again. The time has never been better for the right to articulate a coherent, limited government philosophy against a president who looks increasingly out of touch. Manage Newsletters "

She said the Obama administration is dedicated to ensuring that the Southwest border remains open for business amidst drug cartel violence in Mexico and that increased security should not come at the price of trade, travel and tourism. “The Obama Administration has dedicated historic levels of manpower, technology and infrastructure to the Southwest border to ensure the safety of border communities, and these resources have made a significant impact,” she said. “Some of America’s safest communities are in the Southwest border region, with border city crime rates staying steady or dropping over the past decade.” But the NBPC said the violence that has occurred along the border in recent years shows that crime is spilling over from Mexico, noting that Border Patrol agents, ranchers and citizens have been killed, kidnapped, shot at and targeted and that the Phoenix area has risen to become a “cartel-related crime hotspot.” “If the border was better now than it ever has been, Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry would not have been brutally murdered by heavily-armed Mexican criminals operating over 13 miles inside the United States,” the NBPC said. “In some countries, that is construed as an act of war, but here we get words not deeds when Napolitano terms events like this as evidence ‘there is much to do with our colleagues in Mexico with respect to the drug cartels.’” Mr. Terry, 40, was attempting to arrest bandits who prey on illegal immigrants when he was killed Dec. 14 during a gunfight north of the U.S.-Mexico border near Rio Rico, Ariz., 60 miles south of Tucson. The agent was waiting with three other agents in a remote area north of Nogales when the gunbattle erupted. None of the other agents was injured, but one of the suspects was wounded. A former U.S. Marine, Mr. Terry was a four-year veteran of the agency and a member of the Border Patrol’s elite Search, Trauma and Rescue (BORSTAR) team. He was struck in the pelvis by a round fired by a suspect armed with an AK-47. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer said the state was “shocked and saddened” by the shooting, adding that “this tragedy serves as stark notice that the threats facing all who serve in protecting our state and nation are real, and are increasing on a daily basis.” U.S. Customs and Border Protection described the killing as a “tragic reminder of the ever-present dangers” CBP agents, officers and inspectors face as they protect the nation’s borders. The shooting is being investigated by the FBI and the Santa Cruz County, Ariz., Sheriff’s Office. Bandits, usually Mexican nationals, have long roamed border areas, robbing and sexually assaulting illegal immigrants as they cross into the U.S. Mr. Terry was the third Border Patrol agent killed in the line of duty over the past three years: Agent Robert W. Rosas, Jr., was killed on July 23, 2009, shot while on patrol near Campo, Calif., and Agent Luis A. Aguilar was killed Jan. 19, 2008, when he was intentionally struck by the driver of a vehicle he was attempting to stop. For more than two years, U.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials have been warning that the dramatic rise in violence along the southwest border could spread and eventually target U.S. citizens. The violence posed what the officials called a “serious threat” to law enforcement officers, first responders and residents along the 1,951-mile border. Ms. Napolitano said the security of the border communities “strengthens the prosperity of the region.” “We all agree that the challenges at the border are real but so is the progress we’ve made over the last two years,” she said. “I’m proud to join with our border communities in spreading the word that the Southwest border is, indeed, open for business.” But the NBPC, in its statement, said, “The U.S.-Mexico border is unsafe and to say anything else is not true.” "

It was a “grave hour,” he began, “perhaps the most fateful in our history.” The king said that “for the second time in the lives of most of us, we are at war.” That, however, was back when war was war. Now it is just kinetic military activity. The king’s speech, so recently dramatized in an Oscar-winning film starring Colin Firth, was significant because though George VI suffered a speech impediment, his message was of the highest importance. President Obama, by contrast, has always been given ludicrously high marks for his abilities as an orator but seldom has anything substantive to say. Mr. Obama waited nine days after U.S. forces began to engage in hostilities in Libya to make a major address to the nation. He initially avoided making more than perfunctory remarks because U.S. involvement in the nonwar was supposed to be brief and limited. But as the kinetic became more frenetic, and Mr. Obama didn’t see the favorable bump in public opinion most presidents enjoy after unleashing military force, he was compelled to address the issue head on. Unbeknownst to the novice commander in chief, Mr. Obama faces a mass of contradictions that makes this conflict a hard sell.

The Nobel Prize-winning man of peace who expanded America’s wars; the champion of Muslims who only helps them when it’s convenient; and the great global leader who continually emphasizes America’s declining influence: What a long strange odyssey the Obama presidency has become.

"A very alert Tatler reader tipped us to this statement by President Obama. It’s from an interview he did in El Salvador during his swing through Central and South America. Take a look at how he characterizes how the United States has ended up putting troops in harm’s way in Libya. And we will continue to support the efforts to protect the Libyan people, but we will not be in the lead. That’s what the transition that I discussed has always been designed to do. We have unique capabilities. We came in, up front, fairly readily, fairly substantially, and at considerable risk to our military personnel. And when this transition takes place, it is not going to be our planes that are maintaining the no-fly zone. It is not going to be our ships that are necessarily involved in enforcing the arms embargo. That’s precisely what the other coalition partners are going to do. And that’s why building this international coalition has been so important because it means that the United States is not bearing all the cost. It means that we have confidence that we are not going in alone, and it is our military that is being volunteered by others to carry out missions that are important not only to us, but are important internationally. And we will accomplish that in a relatively short period of time. (emphasis added) There are problems with all of that, especially in the military capabilities and will to act that this president seems to think our allies possess. There would have been no no-fly zone without the US, and there will be no no-fly zone if we’re not playing a major role in enforcing it. That’s just reality. But moving past that, the bolded sentence in the second paragraph beggars belief. As president, Obama is the commander-in-chief of the US military. It should not be “volunteered by others” for anything. Obama is, to borrow the word of a previous president, the decider when it comes to deploying the military. But here is more evidence that not only is Obama uncomfortable with command, he is also very leery of American leadership in the world. See Tony Katz’s article at PJM for a deeper look into that. Lest anyone think I’m making a bit too much of all of this, take a look at how Obama slipped up in the very next part of the interview. Now, with respect to our national interests, the American people and the United States have an interest, first of all, in making sure that where a brutal dictator is threatening his people and saying he will show no mercy and go door-to-door hunting people down, and we have the capacity under international sanction to do something about that, I think it’s in America’s international — in America’s national interest to do something about it. (emphasis added) He almost said the Libya action is being taken because it’s in America’s international interests. But as if to underscore the above, on the allies’ willingness to enforce the Libya action, Germany has pulled its forces out of NATO operations in the Med. But Germany and European allies remain unwilling to have NATO take on a military operation that theoretically has nothing to do with the defence of Europe. Today the German defence ministry announced Berlin had pulled out of any military operations in the Mediterranean. A ministry spokesman said two frigates and two other ships with a crew of 550 would be reverted to German command. Some 60 to 70 German troops participating in NATO-operated AWACS surveillance operations in the Mediterranean would also be withdrawn, according to the ministry. This is a coalition and a war in total disarray, because the American president is abdicating his responsibility at every turn. "
"by Craig S. Glass In 1781, Alexander Todd loaned $10 to help displaced Patriots in South Carolina and Georgia; this was the receipt, signed by Treasurer George Meade. Repayment of the $10 plus $9.62 in interest came in 1797 to Todd’s estate, after Todd had died, and was performed by Josiah Smith, Jr., Cashier of the Charleston branch of the Bank of the United States. The Historical Society of Pennsylvania has the “list of subscribers” to the program as donated by Civil War General George G. Meade. Image used with permission from the South Carolina Department of Archives and History. Views expressed in this post do not necessarily represent those of the SCDAH. By mid-1781, the British “Southern Strategy” had taken its toll on South Carolina and Georgia. Even while General Nathanael Greene was beginning to take back South Carolina for the Continentals, many civilian Patriots in the southernmost new states found themselves penniless fugitives amidst the heavy Redcoat presence. They had lost everything, many having fled to safety in the northern states. But they were not forgotten or ignored. On June 23, 1781, the Congressional representatives of South Carolina and Georgia introduced a resolution to aid their fellow statesmen in need: Resolved, That Commissioners [five suitable persons] be appointed and authorised to open a subscription for a loan of [thirty thousand] dollars, for the support of such of the citizens of the states of South Carolina and Georgia, as have been driven from their country and possessions by the enemy, the said states, respectively, by their delegates in Congress, pledging their faith for the re-payment of the sums [so lent,] with interest, [in proportion to the sums which shall be received by their respective citizens, as soon as the legislatures of the said states shall severally be in condition to make provision for so doing], and Congress hereby guaranteeing this obligation: That the said Commissioners [five persons] do also receive voluntary and free donations, to be applied to the support of such [further relief of the said sufferers as are willing to accept the same. Ordered, That the President send a copy of the above resolution to the executives of the several states not in the power of the enemy, requesting them to promote the success of the said loan and donation within their respective bounds in such way as they shall think best. The resolution having passed, the commission was set up (its Treasurer would be George Meade, grandfather of the Civil War general), and many individuals began loaning and donating money to aid those in need. It was, in essence, a welfare scheme, but one that was very different than what we see today, emphasizing several core Founding principles: 1. Voluntary charity. In this case, those who loaned money would eventually receive it back with interest. Similarly, in our day, we can get tax deductions. Nobody was forced to loan money for this cause, but many did, and some even flat-out donated. Americans compassionately gave when not forced to do so. 2. Capitalism. Because funds were to be repaid with interest, there was no true goal of wealth redistribution. Eventually, those South Carolinians and Georgians who received aid would, theoretically, repay the loans themselves through taxes collected at the state level. Additionally, this plan on the whole was an excellent example of the free market displaying ingenuity to entice investors, offering a solid product and promising a good return. Unlike modern entitlement programs, those who made loans under this plan in 1781 did so of their own choice, understanding the riskiness of their investments. 3. Federalism. The structure of the resolution placed the federal government in its proper role of an agent to help facilitate the process, something that would have been sloppy if handled by multiple states in the midst of a war on home soil. The oversight commission was therefore to be a federal one, but it was only to help smooth the process, ensuring that accounts were taken and streamlining the funds transfers. South Carolina and Georgia took responsibility for repaying the loans in the future, and Congress placed the burden of soliciting loaners and donors on the several states (after the President, acting once again only as a facilitating agent, sent the other states copies of the resolution). In the end, Americans loaned and donated money in a creatively-designed system that relied on the people for charity and investment, on the states for solicitation and repayment, and on the federal government for bookkeeping. Through it all, they helped fellow countrymen who needed a hand-up through no fault of their own and who hoped to not remain impoverished forever just because the British swept through their home towns. If the British had won the war, these monies would have been lost, but then so would have most everything else in the possession of those who were Patriotic enough to have publicly made such loans in the first place. But with the Americans having prevailed, the entitlement-program-as-a-voluntary-investment idea was a winner in itself. It’s one that could serve as a model for how to truly “promote the general Welfare,” especially in these budget-crunched times. 2 comments Great post! [Reply] Craig S.

"We are constantly expanding our inventory to give you the best domains available for purchase! Read or Listen to the Free Book! The top business book that also teaches to give back. This domain name will potentially help you bring in more customers and profits every day, as the domain itself goes up in value. A super premium .Com domain name from DomainMarket.com means instant branding, search engine, and marketing benefits. We make it safe, easy and affordable for you to own .com right away. DomainMarket.com domains are carefully selected for branding excellence by the world's top domain name appraisers, so you will only find the most prized and premium assets for sale. If the value of one new lifelong customer and its references makes up for the domain cost, imagine how a great domain from DomainMarket.com will benefit when it helps you attract multitudes of unexpected new customers (whose value far surpasses the domain value, which keeps rising). Review the Microsoft study proving this phenomenon: ""Domain Bias in Web Search"" This domain is offered for sale by its owner currently at the ""buy it now"" price listed ""BIN"" Click here to purchase .com, but could be withdrawn at any time or its price potentially substantially raised. Also, once sold, the next owner, your domain competitor, would likely never re-sell it again, especially to his competitor; and would instead try to take all your customers and potential customers, year after year, to the extent possible, which you should do to them by purchasing the domain first. You may find a Make Offer button on certain higher value domains; but beware, expressing demand in a domain or visiting a URL usually raises its price. You can buy at the current price at any time, as long as you are first, and its still being offered for sale. The issue to recognize is that the current price naturally trends upwards over time, then additionally based on traffic, expressed interest, and other apparent demand. So time is of the essence, especially right now, with prices escalating precipitously. For serious companies and marketing executives, attracting just one new lifetime customer, business partner, or employee, leveraging a premium domain, will justify this excellent long-term investment. But in fact, your DomainMarket.com sourced super premium domain is likely to rake in many valuable new customers and opportunities in the long run that normally couldn't or wouldn’t find you. Compared to the risk and sunk costs of traditional advertising channels, or newer online advertising methods, this is clearly a huge home run. Other types of advertising are not resellable assets like domains, with long term investment opportunity; other advertising investments are all very risky comparatively, and are mostly wasted if you think about it. First come, first served. Don't miss this once in a lifetime opportunity to be #1. The first person or company to secure .com from this site can control it forever, to the exclusion of all others. It will become out of our control. Get it first; and get ranked first in Google! All that matters online is Location Location Location! Your Domain is Your Location! and brand, and future profits; dont shortchange it obviously! You can redirect your new domain traffic to your existing internet assets until you are done with development, or indefinitely, if you prefer. Would you really consider shortchanging your permanent global brand by skipping the perfect .Com and letting someone else dominate online forever, and potentially offline? That would be a very costly mistake for your family's future and for the other stakeholders of your entity; everyone similarly situated regrets it. The world's best companies and smartest professionals always rely on DomainMarket.com and our super-premium, contextual .Com domains to leverage their branding opportunities. 500 out of 500 of the 'Fortune 500' corporations use .Com, and all of the world's best salespeople and marketers; they aren’t going anywhere. Dozens of others could use your trade name or trademark in a variety of industries, but only one of you can be smart enough to control the .Com customer traffic forever. If you don't own the exact match .Com premium domain best suited for your offerings then over time your brand and site is likely to get lost in Google and in the minds of potential customers; rendered irrelevant. Plus, it would be super embarassing and costly for your customers or prospects to land on this site when they are actually looking to purchase from you instead. Plus you may be able to profit from the consumer traffic, ""eyeballs"", and sell advertising space or use Google AdWords on the domain site, to your financial advantage. Our partner SEO.com are a team of world class digital marketing experts and select Google Partners. We recommend you contact them for any assistance with online advertising, marketing, SEO, PPC, landing page optimization, ecommerce, conversion optimization, web design, Facebook ads and more. Super premium .com domain names from DomainMarket.com are the start and top of the economic food chain, in order to create the best on and offline 'unicorn' corporations. Pick the wrong domain and you deserve the consequences of your competitors rolling you. Next you need the rest of the best of modern digital marketing if you want to compete with serious players in your industry. ""Ring.com [sold for $1B] was previously called DoorBot, His tenacity, and the decision to stick with the product he originally built [but with better domain], has paid off in a big way."" Almost all decent TV ads now use premium generic .Com too, and radio ads, plus sides of trucks, billboards, bumper stickers, boats, planes, tshirts, blogs, etc. You may be one of these 'Fortune 500' mega corporations ready to dominate the world, or just a regular granny in your underwear, but either way you can look the same with .com. DomainMarket.com is the only authorized pricing agent for this domain name, anyone else is a third party seller. Every domain price on this site is completed by top world experts from AccurateAppraisals.com. It's critical to secure your domain today if you want to control the world class branding and recognition before your competitors who are eyeing it. They might outcompete you forever if they get it first and get all the traffic, conversions, and branding value compounded endlessly. A premium domain could easily add 20% compounding yearly to a company's bottom line profits if deployed properly, which for most companies would prevent them from going out of business. Would you seriously consider letting someone else control your best possible name, Internet branding, and Google positioning forever if you could avoid it? You can control it right now. There is extreme marketing power behind the perfect domain to promote your products and services. Owning a popular English expression and brand online is the Holy Grail for perpetually converting lower cost new customers. Super premium domains from our marketplace generally rise in resale value, and can be reused or resold at any price if you are ever done capitalizing on them, or if you are a domain investor. Sales prices at our market have doubled over the last few years, and likely will again due to worldwide Internet growth, prestige, the general scarcity of super premium .Com domains, historically high demand, and the failure of all competing ""gTLDs"". We have been in business for over 10 years and have sold more of our premium domains than any of our competitors. At our previous company (BuyDomains.com) we launched the whole online premium domain trading industry in 1998. Waiting to purchase your favorite domain is a financial mistake, or, even worse, you may never be able to get it at all, at any price, if someone buys it first. It's much less risky to purchase a super premium domain and name your business accordingly, than any other choices; or at least redirect the free customer traffic to your site. Why would anyone choose to increase their business risks with inferior branding and domains? The ever increasing demand for internet sourced information and services, and premium domain investments is the very bandwagon you need to hop on. The trend is your friend! You may own all the tradenames, trademarks, logos, and social sites in the world, but exact match .Com possession ranking in Google is ten tenths of marketing/branding 'law'. You need to control the keywords and keyword combination strings relevant to your company and industry, forever if possible; bidding on words and paying over and over for advertising is a considerable risk, but buying the .Com is a certainty. The perfect domain, without compromising yourself and your brand, has to come first for a serious business, in order to set yourself apart from all wannabe competitors, and create long term leverage with your other communications and potential advertising. If you pick this domain you may not need expensive, super risky advertising at all, or at least not as much. You also need properly branded professional email if you want to appear professional and convert the highest number of customers at the highest profits. Using Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook, AOL, instead of your own properly branded email address is foolish and unprofessional and fails to add leverage to your brand, or use the leverage from your brand, which should have been professionally built from day one. But no time like the present. Premium domains will keep going up in price due to a ""flight to quality"", millions of global companies, people and projects requiring great branding perpetually. Domain names lower in branding quality than the Super Premium .Com level DomainMarket.com specializes in are far too risky to be considered investments, like all the new “gTLD” domains, or very low level .Coms. They are hobbies at best and more likely just a complete waste. But the right .Com is the ideal investment and marketing vehicle for anyone with ambition. Speaking of ambition; your boss and coworkers will love you; and you may just get a raise, if you improve the URL, email addresses and branding for everyone, forever. Anybody who might have told you that .Com domains would go away, lose value, be replaced by other domain extensions or technologies was totally wrong, or worse. In some cases a premium domain can be effective in helping with your tax strategy too (please ask your accountant for details); or can work as an alternative asset (like Bitcoin), a way to store investment value in ""the cloud"" forever, that is easy, anonymous, and cheap to control and move around (ask a pro). Each domain in our marketplace is individually valued based on a series of attributes, developed by professionals for over two decades. We are the primary dealer for every single fabulous .Com domain listed on our site. Any other legitimate sellers are secondary. A delayed costly escrow process is not necessary to complete your transaction, as we have been the trusted dealer for tens of thousands of domain transactions and transfers, without a glitch. DomainMarket.com is the best known and most trusted competitor in the premium domain name industry. In any event, if it makes you feel even more comfortable, Escrow.com is a purchase option for large transactions. The asking price for .com is based on a careful and professional appraisal by the world's leading experts on domain valuations, the inventors of ecommerce for premium domains. The price is explicitly certified to be fair by real experts, so the buyer can be confident in the great long-term value and investment opportunity for the unique domain asset in question. Your competition for a great domain, and therefore your opportunity to arbitrage or capitalize, is even greater than your normal business competition, because it includes your normal competition, plus any other company or person in the world that wants to invest in domains for the future, plus anyone who competes for the same word, expression, or brand in any marketing or media. For example if you are a lighting manufacturer competing for the domain 'BrightFuture.com' then all the educational institutions or websites in the world could become your competitor for domains, or partner potentially; or you could sell it to them at a huge profit if you are a good investor. Not to mention any religious institution would be well served with that domain. If you’ve ever been to a competitor’s marketplace you will find predominantly random, worthless domains, at prices that were derived without any logical appraisal process. But our domain appraisals and prices are very consistent with one another, regardless whether you appreciate any particular one. Competitors collections and sites with domain names for sale are unappraised mostly, inconsistent if they are priced, and are not done by true professionals oftentimes. Conversely, DomainMarket.com's for sale inventory is highly curated and cleaned for excellence, with proper pricing. Super-premium domain values generally range from $10,000 to $2 million. The average industry sales price is approximately $30,000. Our marketplace also has thousands of “close out” domains, at even lower prices! Building a fabulous online presence starts with a top-quality domain name from DomainMarket.com. Here, you'll find only the very best .Com domain names waiting to be developed into first-rate profitable brands. Domains are valued based on many factors such as marketability and brand-ability, the industry it is related to, similar domain sales, acquisition cost and, if applicable, the website traffic and associated revenue they can drive. A strong domain is one of the best investments you can make in your business, and can pay for itself many times over. Exact match domains from DomainMarket.com dramatically reduce the amount companies pay per click by improving their Quality Scores, the measure by which Google determines a keyword's relevance and cost. Your domain's Quality Score depends on alignment between the paid keyword, ad copy and landing page or website. The more a search query appears in an ad, including in the domain name/display URL, the more relevant the ad appears to the searcher. We are also search engine optimization (SEO) experts, and own SEO.com Inc. corporation with 40 employees. Let us know if you need help getting paid or organic traffic; help in getting to the top of Google. This domain is likely to hold and increase its value over time. Poor domain names lose traffic and new customer conversions to better domain named companies, Microsoft Research calls this effect ""domain bias in web search."" .com is a category killer domain that may be commonly used around the world. Such a name offers your company a clear competitive advantage online and off. .com is relatively easy to spell / highly memorable. Trust and recognition from such a great name drives higher click through rates. Only one person or entity can have it and utilize it online and offline for marketing and advertising (and maintain all future resale rights at any price or profit level). Establish your company, product or service dominance with an outstanding .Com brand. For existing brands, it is the ideal opportunity to re-enforce and protect your brand. Historically, exact match keywords have been rated higher in relevancy for search engine ranking. A super-premium .Com domain name from DomainMarket.com comes at a much lower cost and with a higher long-term value than traditional advertising, which is a very risky sunk cost. Organic web traffic is a natural resource that can be acquired by the domain name owner. These domains for sale are great long-term asset investments, with an advertising annuity value to boot.

"more inflammatory language indicative of his own hate. Pastor Hayes is behaving very un-Christian like by attempting to smear Muslims and the way they worship God. He is clearly trying to prevent Muslim citizens in Sioux Falls from having any place to worship, which is perhaps the most mean-spirited action one can seek to do in our democracy. In fact, it is hard to imagine the founder of Christianity, Jesus, preaching the kind of hate that Pastor Hayes is preaching. Moreover, he is bringing in as a speaker, Frank Gaffney, a right wing demagogue who is a notorious Muslim hater, and who was one of George W. Bush's advisers when Bush decided to attack Iraq in 2003.

He is clearly trying to prevent Muslim citizens in Sioux Falls from having any place to worship, which is perhaps the most mean-spirited action one can seek to do in our democracy. In fact, it is hard to imagine the founder of Christianity, Jesus, preaching the kind of hate that Pastor Hayes is preaching. Moreover, he is bringing in as a speaker, Frank Gaffney, a right wing demagogue who is a notorious Muslim hater, and who was one of George W. Bush's advisers when Bush decided to attack Iraq in 2003. We thought we were finished with the kind of McCarthyism in the 1940s and 1950s that Pastor Hayes is preaching, a kind of preaching then that did great harm to our nation, causing divisions that still resound in the most negative way. By implying that Muslim people here in Sioux Falls are a danger to our community, he is resorting to the kind of innuendo and allegations that are extremely threatening to people of the Muslim faith here in Sioux Falls, while contributing nothing to civilization. What is disturbing about Sen. Abourezk is that he is unstinting in defending local and national Muslim rights to worship, but not those of embattled Christian minorities in strife torn Egypt, Lebanon, Syria and Iraq. This is pitiable behavior for a son of Middle East Christian immigrants to America. To our mind that makes him a dhimmi fellow traveler to these Stealth Jihad victories erupting across America.

Posted on 03/29/2011 2:21:58 PM PDT by TheDingoAteMyBaby Mark this date on your calendars. It will, like Pearl Harbor, “live in infamy.” Why? Because the Muslim Brotherhood may have won several Stealth Jihad victories across America in Washington, DC, Tallahassee – Florida’s State Capitol and Sioux Falls, South Dakota. This great tsunami wave of Stealth Jihad started Sunday, March 27th with the launch of CNN’s “Unwelcome: Muslims Next Door” Soledad O’Brien’s “In America” documentary on alleged Muslim discrimination in Murfreesboro, Tennessee over the Islamic Center expansion project. The tag line in our post on the documentary was “Too sympathetic and biased”. In Washington, DC, we have a hearing today in the US Senate on alleged anti-Muslim bigotry chaired by Illinois Democratic Senator Dick Durbin which delves into limited evidence of such allegations (puny when compared to the spike in anti-Semitic incidents in America). Steve Emerson’s The Investigative Project on terrorism (IPT) called the Durbin Senate hearing, today, “flawed."" Frank Gaffney’s Washington–based Center for Security policy released a report debunking Sen. Durbin’s myth of rising anti-Muslim bigotry in America using FBI statistics compiled over the period from 2000 to 2009. In a Washington Times article published yesterday, Gaffney considers today’s Durbin Hearing as “the Anti-Pete King hearing”. In Tallahassee, the third annual Florida Muslim Capitol Day organized by ex-Tampa CAIR director, Egyptian-born Ahmed Bedier, former spokesperson for convicted terror supporter Sami al Arian, and founder of United Voices for America, got an endorsement from Governor Rick Scott. This despite evidence that Rich Swier in a Red County article “Florida Muslim Brotherhood Organizes Muslim Capitol Day” portrayed Bedier’s “two faces” –speaking about grass roots democracy in both Florida and Egypt while advancing the Muslim Brotherhood's green flag. Bedier, according to Swier, wants Democracy for the Muslim Brotherhood and not for the rest of us. We expect to report on those Tallahassee developments later. Against this tsunami of Stealth Jihad “victories’ was pitted an intrepid band of activists from the newly launched The United West organization spearheaded by Tom Trento of the Florida Security Council. We talked with Trento on a Skype call in Sioux Falls as he, Lisa Marie Johnson, Joel Arends, South Dakota State Senator Dan Lederman, of the Great Plains Chapter of the Republican Jewish Coalition and founder of the Jewish Christian Coalition of the Midwest and Frank Gaffney of CSP were finalizing security arrangements for tonight’s showing of the film Iranium produced by the Clarion Fund. Tough security arrangements were required given an expected crowd of over 250 who will show up tonight because of the eruption of cries of anti-Muslim hatred from the leaders of the Islamic Center of Sioux Falls and former US Senator, James Abourezk, founder and Emeritus Chair of the Arab American Anti-Discrimination Committee, prominent anti-Israel advocate and alleged antisemite. Abourezk had sent a letter to the US Attorney in Sioux Falls requesting an investigation of these charges. We noted this background in our post in mid-February about the America law for American Courts Legislation, “Anti-Sharia Legislation Introduced in South Dakota despite “Death to Israel” Threats.” These allegations from Abourezk erupted because of a letter sent by a local Christian Evangelical pastor, Rev. Jeff Hayes of Faith Temple Church who is an iconic figure of mercy in Sioux Falls for all faiths, including Muslims, because he runs a respected community feeding program. The trigger for Abourezk accusations was a letter sent by Pastor Hayes suggesting that church members attend a viewing of Iranium in Sioux Falls tonight. In the letter Hayes sent, he recounts a death threat made against him two years ago by a local Muslim for his criticism of Islam and Muslim perpetrators of 9/11. Steve Young, religious writer for the Sioux Falls Argus Leader had a report on the front page of today’s edition giving us elements of this alleged anti-Muslim bigotry stoked by Sen. Abourezk’s letter, “Call to view film sparks fears of hate-mongering.” Here are some excerpts from Young’s Argus Leader story: A pastor's letter encouraging people to attend the screening of a documentary called ""Iranium,"" which looks at Iran's nuclear threat to the West, is stirring charges of hate-mongering in Sioux Falls. In a letter sent March 12, the Rev. Jeff Hayes of Faith Temple Church invited people to attend the screening today at the Holiday Inn City Centre in part because of concerns he has that Islam ""isn't always a religion of peace, and it also treats its own members often times in barbaric ways."" Hayes said he, his wife and daughter were attending an informational session on Islam two years ago at the Oak View Public Library when a Muslim upset with his questions about 9-11 said, ""If you offend us or our religion, we have the right to kill you.” [. . .] ""It's nothing more than preaching hate,"" Abourezk, a lawyer in Sioux Falls, said. ""By implying Muslim people here in Sioux Falls are a danger to our community, he is resorting to the kind of innuendo and allegations that are extremely threatening to people of the Muslim faith.""

Hayes said he, his wife and daughter were attending an informational session on Islam two years ago at the Oak View Public Library when a Muslim upset with his questions about 9-11 said, ""If you offend us or our religion, we have the right to kill you.” [. . .] ""It's nothing more than preaching hate,"" Abourezk, a lawyer in Sioux Falls, said. ""By implying Muslim people here in Sioux Falls are a danger to our community, he is resorting to the kind of innuendo and allegations that are extremely threatening to people of the Muslim faith."" Lisa Marie Johnson of Mary's Project, the nonprofit sponsoring the screening of the film, called Hayes ""an incredible pastor"" and said ""we highly esteem him."" But she said the pastor's letter did not accurately reflect what tonight's event is all about. ""This particular evening is about a film documentary. It is an education series,"" Johnson said. ""We do have a group of Muslim leaders who will be in attendance. We're excited about that."" Asif Zabih, former president of the Islamic Center of Sioux Falls, said all religions have their radical elements. But Islam practiced by most Muslims is a religion of peace, Zabih said, adding, ""It does not allow even the killing of another person."" Hayes said his church has a feeding ministry that serves many Muslims. ""I talk to them,"" he said. ""I tell them they are wonderful, and we love them."" But Abourezk said such words ""sound very familiar to those who proclaim that their best friends are Jews, or whatever ethnic group the speaker is about to begin attacking."" He has taken Hayes' letter to the U.S. Attorney's office in Sioux Falls, Abourezk said. Officials at the office confirmed they have received it but wouldn't comment further. We obtained a copy of Abourezk’s letter to Pastor Hayes because it had more inflammatory language indicative of his own hate. Pastor Hayes is behaving very un-Christian like by attempting to smear Muslims and the way they worship God. He is clearly trying to prevent Muslim citizens in Sioux Falls from having any place to worship, which is perhaps the most mean-spirited action one can seek to do in our democracy. In fact, it is hard to imagine the founder of Christianity, Jesus, preaching the kind of hate that Pastor Hayes is preaching. Moreover, he is bringing in as a speaker, Frank Gaffney, a right wing demagogue who is a notorious Muslim hater, and who was one of George W. Bush's advisers when Bush decided to attack Iraq in 2003. We thought we were finished with the kind of McCarthyism in the 1940s and 1950s that Pastor Hayes is preaching, a kind of preaching then that did great harm to our nation, causing divisions that still resound in the most negative way. By implying that Muslim people here in Sioux Falls are a danger to our community, he is resorting to the kind of innuendo and allegations that are extremely threatening to people of the Muslim faith here in Sioux Falls, while contributing nothing to civilization. What is disturbing about Sen. Abourezk is that he is unstinting in defending local and national Muslim rights to worship, but not those of embattled Christian minorities in strife torn Egypt, Lebanon, Syria and Iraq. This is pitiable behavior for a son of Middle East Christian immigrants to America. To our mind that makes him a dhimmi fellow traveler to these Stealth Jihad victories erupting across America.

This despite evidence that Rich Swier in a Red County article “Florida Muslim Brotherhood Organizes Muslim Capitol Day” portrayed Bedier’s “two faces” –speaking about grass roots democracy in both Florida and Egypt while advancing the Muslim Brotherhood's green flag. Bedier, according to Swier, wants Democracy for the Muslim Brotherhood and not for the rest of us. We expect to report on those Tallahassee developments later. Against this tsunami of Stealth Jihad “victories’ was pitted an intrepid band of activists from the newly launched The United West organization spearheaded by Tom Trento of the Florida Security Council. We talked with Trento on a Skype call in Sioux Falls as he, Lisa Marie Johnson, Joel Arends, South Dakota State Senator Dan Lederman, of the Great Plains Chapter of the Republican Jewish Coalition and founder of the Jewish Christian Coalition of the Midwest and Frank Gaffney of CSP were finalizing security arrangements for tonight’s showing of the film Iranium produced by the Clarion Fund. Tough security arrangements were required given an expected crowd of over 250 who will show up tonight because of the eruption of cries of anti-Muslim hatred from the leaders of the Islamic Center of Sioux Falls and former US Senator, James Abourezk, founder and Emeritus Chair of the Arab American Anti-Discrimination Committee, prominent anti-Israel advocate and alleged antisemite. Abourezk had sent a letter to the US Attorney in Sioux Falls requesting an investigation of these charges. We noted this background in our post in mid-February about the America law for American Courts Legislation, “Anti-Sharia Legislation Introduced in South Dakota despite “Death to Israel” Threats.” These allegations from Abourezk erupted because of a letter sent by a local Christian Evangelical pastor, Rev. Jeff Hayes of Faith Temple Church who is an iconic figure of mercy in Sioux Falls for all faiths, including Muslims, because he runs a respected community feeding program. The trigger for Abourezk accusations was a letter sent by Pastor Hayes suggesting that church members attend a viewing of Iranium in Sioux Falls tonight. In the letter Hayes sent, he recounts a death threat made against him two years ago by a local Muslim for his criticism of Islam and Muslim perpetrators of 9/11. Steve Young, religious writer for the Sioux Falls Argus Leader had a report on the front page of today’s edition giving us elements of this alleged anti-Muslim bigotry stoked by Sen. Abourezk’s letter, “Call to view film sparks fears of hate-mongering.” Here are some excerpts from Young’s Argus Leader story: A pastor's letter encouraging people to attend the screening of a documentary called ""Iranium,"" which looks at Iran's nuclear threat to the West, is stirring charges of hate-mongering in Sioux Falls.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article , LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 .com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson We noted this background in our post in mid-February about the America law for American Courts Legislation, “Anti-Sharia Legislation Introduced in South Dakota despite “Death to Israel” Threats.” These allegations from Abourezk erupted because of a letter sent by a local Christian Evangelical pastor, Rev. Jeff Hayes of Faith Temple Church who is an iconic figure of mercy in Sioux Falls for all faiths, including Muslims, because he runs a respected community feeding program. The trigger for Abourezk accusations was a letter sent by Pastor Hayes suggesting that church members attend a viewing of Iranium in Sioux Falls tonight. In the letter Hayes sent, he recounts a death threat made against him two years ago by a local Muslim for his criticism of Islam and Muslim perpetrators of 9/11. Steve Young, religious writer for the Sioux Falls Argus Leader had a report on the front page of today’s edition giving us elements of this alleged anti-Muslim bigotry stoked by Sen. Abourezk’s letter, “Call to view film sparks fears of hate-mongering.” Here are some excerpts from Young’s Argus Leader story: A pastor's letter encouraging people to attend the screening of a documentary called ""Iranium,"" which looks at Iran's nuclear threat to the West, is stirring charges of hate-mongering in Sioux Falls. In a letter sent March 12, the Rev. Jeff Hayes of Faith Temple Church invited people to attend the screening today at the Holiday Inn City Centre in part because of concerns he has that Islam ""isn't always a religion of peace, and it also treats its own members often times in barbaric ways."" Hayes said he, his wife and daughter were attending an informational session on Islam two years ago at the Oak View Public Library when a Muslim upset with his questions about 9-11 said, ""If you offend us or our religion, we have the right to kill you.” [. . .] ""It's nothing more than preaching hate,"" Abourezk, a lawyer in Sioux Falls, said. ""By implying Muslim people here in Sioux Falls are a danger to our community, he is resorting to the kind of innuendo and allegations that are extremely threatening to people of the Muslim faith."" Lisa Marie Johnson of Mary's Project, the nonprofit sponsoring the screening of the film, called Hayes ""an incredible pastor"" and said ""we highly esteem him."" But she said the pastor's letter did not accurately reflect what tonight's event is all about. ""This particular evening is about a film documentary. It is an education series,"" Johnson said. ""We do have a group of Muslim leaders who will be in attendance. We're excited about that."" Asif Zabih, former president of the Islamic Center of Sioux Falls, said all religions have their radical elements. But Islam practiced by most Muslims is a religion of peace, Zabih said, adding, ""It does not allow even the killing of another person."" Hayes said his church has a feeding ministry that serves many Muslims. ""I talk to them,"" he said. ""I tell them they are wonderful, and we love them."" But Abourezk said such words ""sound very familiar to those who proclaim that their best friends are Jews, or whatever ethnic group the speaker is about to begin attacking."" He has taken Hayes' letter to the U.S. Attorney's office in Sioux Falls, Abourezk said. Officials at the office confirmed they have received it but wouldn't comment further. We obtained a copy of Abourezk’s letter to Pastor Hayes because it had more inflammatory language indicative of his own hate. Pastor Hayes is behaving very un-Christian like by attempting to smear Muslims and the way they worship God. He is clearly trying to prevent Muslim citizens in Sioux Falls from having any place to worship, which is perhaps the most mean-spirited action one can seek to do in our democracy. In fact, it is hard to imagine the founder of Christianity, Jesus, preaching the kind of hate that Pastor Hayes is preaching. Moreover, he is bringing in as a speaker, Frank Gaffney, a right wing demagogue who is a notorious Muslim hater, and who was one of George W. Bush's advisers when Bush decided to attack Iraq in 2003. We thought we were finished with the kind of McCarthyism in the 1940s and 1950s that Pastor Hayes is preaching, a kind of preaching then that did great harm to our nation, causing divisions that still resound in the most negative way. By implying that Muslim people here in Sioux Falls are a danger to our community, he is resorting to the kind of innuendo and allegations that are extremely threatening to people of the Muslim faith here in Sioux Falls, while contributing nothing to civilization. What is disturbing about Sen. Abourezk is that he is unstinting in defending local and national Muslim rights to worship, but not those of embattled Christian minorities in strife torn Egypt, Lebanon, Syria and Iraq. This is pitiable behavior for a son of Middle East Christian immigrants to America. To our mind that makes him a dhimmi fellow traveler to these Stealth Jihad victories erupting across America.

Abourezk’s letter, “Call to view film sparks fears of hate-mongering.” Here are some excerpts from Young’s Argus Leader story: A pastor's letter encouraging people to attend the screening of a documentary called ""Iranium,"" which looks at Iran's nuclear threat to the West, is stirring charges of hate-mongering in Sioux Falls. In a letter sent March 12, the Rev. Jeff Hayes of Faith Temple Church invited people to attend the screening today at the Holiday Inn City Centre in part because of concerns he has that Islam ""isn't always a religion of peace, and it also treats its own members often times in barbaric ways."" Hayes said he, his wife and daughter were attending an informational session on Islam two years ago at the Oak View Public Library when a Muslim upset with his questions about 9-11 said, ""If you offend us or our religion, we have the right to kill you.” [. . .] ""It's nothing more than preaching hate,"" Abourezk, a lawyer in Sioux Falls, said.

In a letter sent March 12, the Rev. Jeff Hayes of Faith Temple Church invited people to attend the screening today at the Holiday Inn City Centre in part because of concerns he has that Islam ""isn't always a religion of peace, and it also treats its own members often times in barbaric ways."" Hayes said he, his wife and daughter were attending an informational session on Islam two years ago at the Oak View Public Library when a Muslim upset with his questions about 9-11 said, ""If you offend us or our religion, we have the right to kill you.” [. . .] ""It's nothing more than preaching hate,"" Abourezk, a lawyer in Sioux Falls, said. ""By implying Muslim people here in Sioux Falls are a danger to our community, he is resorting to the kind of innuendo and allegations that are extremely threatening to people of the Muslim faith."" Lisa Marie Johnson of Mary's Project, the nonprofit sponsoring the screening of the film, called Hayes ""an incredible pastor"" and said ""we highly esteem him."" But she said the pastor's letter did not accurately reflect what tonight's event is all about. ""This particular evening is about a film documentary. It is an education series,"" Johnson said. ""We do have a group of Muslim leaders who will be in attendance. We're excited about that."" Asif Zabih, former president of the Islamic Center of Sioux Falls, said all religions have their radical elements. But Islam practiced by most Muslims is a religion of peace, Zabih said, adding, ""It does not allow even the killing of another person."" Hayes said his church has a feeding ministry that serves many Muslims. ""I talk to them,"" he said. ""I tell them they are wonderful, and we love them."" But Abourezk said such words ""sound very familiar to those who proclaim that their best friends are Jews, or whatever ethnic group the speaker is about to begin attacking."" He has taken Hayes' letter to the U.S. Attorney's office in Sioux Falls, Abourezk said. Officials at the office confirmed they have received it but wouldn't comment further. We obtained a copy of Abourezk’s letter to Pastor Hayes because it had more inflammatory language indicative of his own hate. Pastor Hayes is behaving very un-Christian like by attempting to smear Muslims and the way they worship God. He is clearly trying to prevent Muslim citizens in Sioux Falls from having any place to worship, which is perhaps the most mean-spirited action one can seek to do in our democracy. In fact, it is hard to imagine the founder of Christianity, Jesus, preaching the kind of hate that Pastor Hayes is preaching. Moreover, he is bringing in as a speaker, Frank Gaffney, a right wing demagogue who is a notorious Muslim hater, and who was one of George W. Bush's advisers when Bush decided to attack Iraq in 2003. We thought we were finished with the kind of McCarthyism in the 1940s and 1950s that Pastor Hayes is preaching, a kind of preaching then that did great harm to our nation, causing divisions that still resound in the most negative way. By implying that Muslim people here in Sioux Falls are a danger to our community, he is resorting to the kind of innuendo and allegations that are extremely threatening to people of the Muslim faith here in Sioux Falls, while contributing nothing to civilization. What is disturbing about Sen. Abourezk is that he is unstinting in defending local and national Muslim rights to worship, but not those of embattled Christian minorities in strife torn Egypt, Lebanon, Syria and Iraq. This is pitiable behavior for a son of Middle East Christian immigrants to America. To our mind that makes him a dhimmi fellow traveler to these Stealth Jihad victories erupting across America.

"Flickr/<a  Congressional Republicans have made a big deal about slashing funds for Planned Parenthood and other family planning programs, claiming that these cuts are necessary to address the federal deficit. But one of those lawmakers has been pushing his own measure to provide additional federal funds to so-called crisis pregnancy centers—unregulated and uncertified clinics that try to deter women from seeking abortions. A bill that Rep. Cliff Stearns (R-Fla.) introduced in January would provide federal funds for the purchase of sonogram machines at organizations that counsel women against having an abortion (the American Independent reported on this bill last week). These crisis pregnancy outfits, sometimes called “pregnancy resource centers,” are often run by religious groups; many have been found to provide women with false and misleading information to dissuade them from having an abortion. The preamble of Stearns’ bill makes it sound as though any nonprofit, tax-exempt organization could apply to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for grants to purchase ultrasound equipment. But the bill comes with stipulations. To be eligible for this grant, a facility would have to show every woman seeking services the ultrasound image and describe to them the “general anatomical and physiological description of the characteristics of the fetus.” The facility would be required to provide women with “alternatives to abortion such as childbirth and adoption and information concerning public and private agencies that will assist in those alternatives.” It also must offer its services free of charge. That last condition would disqualify abortion providers, such as Planned Parenthood, which charges on a sliding scale based on a woman’s income. In a commentary published last month on Andrew Breitbart’s conservative site, BigGovernment.com, Stearns couched his own opposition to funding for Planned Parenthood in terms of both fiscal and moral responsibility: “The federal government funds thousands of programs and projects, and Congress must look at all federal expenditures and reduce or eliminate those that do not meet the needs of the American people.” But under his bill, a “community-based pregnancy help medical clinic” can receive a grant to cover half the cost of a sonogram machine, or up to $20,000. It authorizes up to $5 million for fiscal year 2012, with the possibility of renewal for 2013 and 2014. Stearns offered similar measures in 2003, 2007, and 2009. So far, his latest bill has no cosponsors. Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.), who challenged the GOP’s efforts to cut funding for Planned Parenthood and other family planning programs in a floor speech last month, called Stearns’ measure “hypocrisy in its most obvious form.” “As Republicans seek to defund Planned Parenthood and deny vital health care services to American women most in need, they want to spend taxpayer dollars to support crisis pregnancy centers, which have become anti-choice groups’ sneaky alternative to legitimate reproductive health clinics,” said Speier via email. “These deceiving clinics entice women who are seeking abortions and then subject them to ultrasounds—with the explicit goal of convincing them not to have an abortion.” Crisis pregnancy centers—often run by religious groups—received $30 million from HHS between 2001 and 2006 for abstinence-only programs and other projects, according to a 2006 House Energy and Commerce Committee report. The HHS grant database indicates another $9.3 million in grants were given to CPCs since 2007. There have been other attempts in recent years to increase federal funding for these organizations. In 2009, Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) introduced the Positive Alternatives Act, a measure that would have amended the Social Security Act to allow funds for low-income assistance to be used for “alternative-to-abortion” services. Abortion rights advocates contended the beneficiaries would have been CPCs. That same year, Sen. John Ensign (R-Nev.) also pushed an amendment that would have boosted federal assistance to CPCs, but the measure failed. CPCs already outnumber abortion providers in the United States and have been bolstered by state and federal support, says Nancy Keenan, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America. “Taxpayers should not foot the bill for organizations that push a political agenda,” she notes. That 2006 congressional investigation found that 20 out of the 23 centers surveyed were providing “false or misleading information” about the potential health effects of abortions. They were promoting false claims about increased risk of breast cancer, decreased fertility, adverse mental health effects, and suicidal tendencies. The investigation also found that many of these centers hid the fact that they endorse a pro-life stance, classifying themselves in advertising and web searches as “abortion services” in order to bring in women seeking abortions. Many of these centers look like clinics that provide abortions, and are often located near them. CPCs have recently been in the news, after South Dakota’s governor signed into law a bill that will require a woman to visit one of these centers—and meet with a counselor whose intention is to dissuade her from having an abortion—before she can obtain an abortion. This measure would also force women to wait 72 hours before undergoing the actual procedure. This requirement will make it much more difficult for women to obtain abortions, given that there’s only one clinic providing abortions in the entire state, and Planned Parenthood has to fly a doctor in once a week to perform abortions there. In New York City, though, abortion rights advocates secured a win on March 16, when Mayor Michael Bloomberg signed a bill compelling pregnancy centers to clearly disclose whether or not they offer abortion services and emergency contraception, and if they have actual medical staff on site. Many of these facilities, said New York City council member and bill sponsor Jessica Lappin, are “deliberately deceiving women, preying upon them and putting their health and lives at risk.” The new law will make it tougher for these anti-abortion crusaders to lure in unsuspecting women interested in obtaining abortions. “This is what we should be doing, instead of going in the opposite direction, which seems to be what people in Washington want to do,” says Lappin. But if Stearns gets his way, such outfits, which often play bait-and-switch, will see an increase in their handouts from Uncle Sam.

"by James D. Best Our new Constitution is now established, and has an appearance that promises permanency; but in this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes. Benjamin Franklin During the second half of the eighteenth century, the United States was blessed with numerous renaissance men. Thomas Jefferson was a planter, architect, revolutionary, author, agricultural scientist, inventor, and politician, among other things. George Washington started life as a surveyor, but then became a successful planter, military commander, politician, entrepreneur, and agricultural innovator. Many of the Founders were equally skillful at multiple endeavors. None, however, could compare with Benjamin Franklin. Franklin’s humorous aphorisms are so embedded in our culture and he has been caricatured so often, we sometimes think he must have been the class clown of the Revolution. Nothing could be further from the truth. Franklin was arguably the second most important person in securing our independence. Despite Washington’s greatest efforts, our domestic military and treasury could never have defeated the British Empire. We needed help. Franklin did more than flirt with the ladies in Paris, he charmed a nation in order to gain access to the French court. The thing to understand about Franklin is that everything he did had a purpose. Once granted access to the back rooms of Versailles, he did the impossible and got the United States desperately needed money, warships, and international legitimacy. Franklin started life as a printer’s apprentice, and ended up exceptionally wealthy. Michael Klepper and Robert Gunther rank him in the top 100 in The Wealthy 100: From Benjamin Franklin to Bill Gates – A Ranking of the Richest Americans, Past and Present. How did he do it? With two grand entrepreneurial moves. He nearly invented the concept of franchising, setting up print shops in cities outside Philadelphia that were as standardized as H & R Block. But the real money came from his realization that content ruled. There were many printers who typeset other people’s material, but Franklin went beyond this standard practice and published a newspaper and Poor Richard’s Almanac. For nearly the entire twenty-five years of its publication, Poor Richard’s Almanac was the country’s #1 bestseller after the Bible. If Franklin had been born in 1960, he’d probably have clobbered Bill Gates; Larry Page and Sergey Brin; Mark Zuckerberg; and Steve Jobs. Franklin's Glass armonica - Wikipedia image Franklin invented bifocals, the Franklin stove, the lightening rod, a urinary catheter, swim flippers, a Glass Armonica, an odometer, and several other devices. It’s generally forgotten that he was a world-class scientist in his day, especially renowned in Europe for his scientific achievements. His famous kite flying episode was not a lark, but an experiment to confirm a portion of his well-developed theory of electricity. He was the first to map the Gulf Stream, which gave him something scientific to occupy his mind during his eight voyages across the Atlantic. In 1727, Franklin founded a philosophical organization called the Junto. This civically minded group led to Philadelphia being the home of the nation’s first volunteer fire department, public hospital, public library, and numerous other improvements that all had Benjamin Franklin’s strong imprint. Franklin transitioned the Junto into the Philosophical Society, the first learned society in the country. Benjamin Franklin played a crucial role in all three phases of our nation’s Founding. In the first stage that built a consensus toward independence, he mirrored many people in the colonies. He was initially a loyalist, but as an informal envoy to England, he changed his mind when he found Parliament intractable. When scolded by a British courtier, he told him, “I will make your master a little king for this.” Despite his jovial image, Franklin could hold a grudge, and he made those who slighted him or his country pay for their transgressions. He returned from England to help Jefferson write the Declaration of Independence. During the second phase, which was the war, Franklin did what the Continental Congress could not do — he delivered money and armed forces to Washington. He got them in France, while at home politicians bickered endlessly. The third phase represented the real nation-building when the Federal Convention wrote the Constitution of the United States. This convention was at times so acrimonious that the delegates almost scattered like a flock of disturbed seagulls. Each time the convention edged toward collapse, Benjamin Franklin was always the one that lightened the tone through humor, calls for help from the Almighty, or merely filibustering until tempers finally abated. Franklin did not add much substance to the constitutional design, but he held the delegates together in the State House until the design was complete. It was a unique role that no one else could fill. Benjamin Franklin built things to last. The American Philosophical Society still resides next to Independence Hall. Poor Richard’s Almanac and his autobiography are still in print. The Philadelphia Contribution for Insurance Against Loss by Fire that he helped found is still selling fire insurance. The University of Pennsylvania and the Pennsylvania Hospital still exist. On leaving the convention after the signing ceremony, a woman asked what type of government they had designed. Franklin responded, “A republic, ma’am, if you can keep it.” His greatest worry was the long term upholding of the Constitution. If he returned today, he would warn us that we’re letting our priceless heritage slip away. He might put aside his own sacrifices and contributions, but his jovial image would not disguise his anger at those who flippantly discarded the work of his friends. James D. Best is the author of Tempest at Dawn, a novel about the 1787 Constitutional Convention. Related posts: 0 comments Kick things off by filling out the form below.

"It’s not an endorsement Barack Obama probably expected — or wanted — but Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol gave the president high marks for his recent foreign policy gestures. In his “You’ve come a long way, baby” post Monday night, Kristol praised Obama for his address to the American people about the action he took against Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. On Wednesday’s “Red Eye” on the Fox News Channel, Kristol took things a step further and declared Obama “a born-again neo-con.” Host Greg Gutfeld asked Kristol how he felt about Obama coming to him for help (reportedly the president had met with him and others prior to his Monday night address). “He didn’t come to me for help, of course,” Kristol said. “I’m not going to acknowledge that. He came to me to make sure I was supporting his sound policies. Of course, since his sound policies are more like the policies people like me have been advocating for quite a while, I’m happy to support them. He’s a born-again neo-con.” Throughout 2007 and 2008 in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, Obama ran as the anti-war candidate. But Obama has taken on different stripes with this gesture, Kristol joked. “What’s the joke – they told me if I voted for McCain, we’d be going to war in a third Muslim country?” Kristol said. “I voted for McCain and we’re doing it.” Watch: The Daily Caller | 1775 Eye Street NW | Suite 1150-290 | Washington, DC 20006"

For example, a used-care salesperson telling you that a car has “low miles,” which is true because when you inspect it, you find out it doesn’t start. His statement was true; it was only part of the true information you need, however. Another way they fool you is the left hand switch. As they shuffle the cards, the right hand makes a big deal of doing what it always does — it’s almost distracting how mundane it is. In fact, the point is to distract you with the right hand while the left hand changes something equally vital behind the scenes. Modern society could be viewed as an endless series of left hand switches. They told you that oppression was a problem, and got rid of the kings, which thrust you into a society ruled by economics. They told you that nationalism was a problem and flung you into multiculturalism, which means you now exist in a world without a standard in common so you never get praised for anything but money and popularity. It’s the vapidity of high school turned up to 11. Their latest left hand switch has been the economy. When the leftists got in control in the 1990s, they unleashed a storm of economic chaos from which the world has not recovered. The result of all this is a left-hand switch: your economy is officially doing what it always has done. There is no inflation per se. But on the left hand, the market is adjusting to the fact that your currency is worth less as a whole. It’s not inflated, in the sense of losing value, so much as viewed as less important and less desirable as repository for value, which means a covert kind of inflation. With unemployment still high, companies in recent months have tried to camouflage price increases by selling their products in tiny and tinier packages. So far, the changes are most visible at the grocery store, where shoppers are paying the same amount, but getting less. For Lisa Stauber, stretching her budget to feed her nine children in Houston often requires careful monitoring at the store. Recently, when she cooked her usual three boxes of pasta for a big family dinner, she was surprised by a smaller yield, and she began to suspect something was up. â€œWhole wheat pasta had gone from 16 ounces to 13.25 ounces,â€ she said. â€œI bought three boxes and it wasnâ€™t enough â€” that was a little embarrassing. I bought the same amount I always buy, I just didnâ€™t realize it, because who reads the sizes all the time?â€ Ms. Stauber, 33, said she began inspecting her other purchases, aisle by aisle. Many canned vegetables dropped to 13 or 14 ounces from 16; boxes of baby wipes went to 72 from 80; and sugar was stacked in 4-pound, not 5-pound, bags, she said. – NYT If they officially admit the problem with our currency, panic occurs and the herd lashes out. However, if they just adjust expectations downward — that ol’ left hand shift — the value adjustment happens while the good oblivious sheep keep drunkenly sleepwalking forward, repeating empty actions in a fug of personal paranoia and denial. Conservatives view modern society as a kind of “evil” because it has this cult-like tendency. You must buy into it, but when you do, the cost is that you put your brain on hold. You accept the official story, which isn’t official from the government so much as it is the intersection of other people’s selfish notions. Evil corporations? Government conspiracies? Secret fascist sects? That’s Hollywood, and nothing Hollywood is real. More likely: a nation of scared sheep demanding illusions be kept alive so that each individual can get what he or she wants and get out of the system. The selfishness of each individual binds them together into a mob which demands illusions, each person thinking that have passively cheated the others and come out ahead. Of course, these people don’t understand economics. Dollar bills have no value except that they’re like stock certificates purchased in a nation. You’re betting on the value of the economy by having them. If you gut an economy and then try to take your wealth out, you’ll find that it has lost value. Some hope to beat this by buying gold, but like most periodistic things, this rewards those with really good fine-tuned timing. The Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index fell sharply from a three-year high in February, reversing five straight months of improvement. The decline raises questions about Americans’ ability and willingness to spend in coming months. The index fell more than expected to 63.4 from a revised 72.0 in February. Economists expected 65.4, according to FactSet. The drop was the steepest since the 10.1-point plunge from January 2010 to February 2010, when the U.S. stock market was hammered by worries about Greece’s national debt. “Rising food and gasoline prices are starting to take their toll on the consumer psyche, and Japan’s triple calamity â€” earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster â€” has been very unsettling,” said Chris Christopher Jr., senior principal economist at HIS Global Insight. – WEX The fools have oversold the whole thing. Not just the economy — heck, if anything, the economy just shows us where our thinking is going, which means that if we’re treating the economy like a Ponzi scheme, we’re also treating home life, education and culture like the same Ponzi scheme. First we oversold our economy, and by the Clinton years were re-valuing paper and re-selling it, truly generating no wealth but inventing it out of thin air because people were willing to pay for chunks of our economy. We were coasting on the momentum of the past, trading altitude for airspeed by rapidly selling off whatever we could jettison. Next, we created a series of bubbles by selling stuff to ourselves. Did we expand into new markets? No, we re-sold stuff to our American consumers. First it was the internet, where we convinced ourselves that some web browser loading an ad was worth money; nevermind that it turned out later it was some impoverished stoned guy in a basement. Next it was in housing, which our brilliant President Clinton inflated by strong-arming banks into loosening up loans, and so we assumed we were doing great because people were buying lots of homes; nevermind that they couldn’t afford them, abandoned them and left behind ghettoes. Don’t watch the right hand; that’s for show. Watch the left. The left hand has slowly siphoned money out of the American and European companies into an elite of international super-rich who make their money not by inventing new things, but by catering to the masses of clueless people who are dependent on entertainment, convenience and populist luxury products like iPods. This is not value added to an economy; this is us pouring water from one cup to another and back again, claiming it has gained in volume. Around four in five female graduates will never repay their student loan under the Coalitionâ€™s new tuition fees regime, it emerged yesterday. An analysis of the student loan system shows that middle-income men who will finally pay-off their loan at the age of 47-50, will bear the brunt of the cost of higher education. The figures show that between 70 and 80 per cent of women â€“ up to 150,000 a year â€“ will never repay their full loan, compared with 20 to 30 per cent at present. And when loans are written off, 30 years after graduation, the average woman will still owe Â£26,500. – The Daily Mail This is from England, but figures are similar in the USA: we have oversold our education. Throughout the 1970s through the 1990s, we dumbed down education so that any idiot could make it through high school. This alienated the smart kids and ensured that most knew nothing. That in turn forced our colleges to become remedial, which meant that our kids graduated having spent half of their college lifetimes re-learning stuff that was botched in high school. But all the parents are happy, because even if Johnny is stupid, he got some kind of award. Too bad that too was oversold. Now that everyone and their dog has a college degree, a college degree is worthless. It is no longer any particular distinction unless you went to Harvard, and even then employers are wary, because Harvard hands out too many degrees for political reasons in lieu of excellence. So now the name of the game to get ahead is to make your way through graduate education or a certification program or both. You are in school until you’re thirty, and then you demand a larger salary. How does industry respond? By lessening the value of your money. Sure, you can have $200,000 per year, but that figure in today’s dollars doesn’t translate at all to what it would have been in 1987 or 1997 dollars. Even more, you have new expenses. Since everyone has a house, it’s more expensive to stay out of the ghetto and away from the dangerous/useless schools. Since medical care is tied up in red tape, you want to be able to afford private pay. Since there are 10,000 criminals to every one cop, you want a neighborhood with private security. The list goes one. Elite-college admissions offices drive professional-class parents crazy because in many respects they do not operate as meritocracies. Consider, for example, those students admitted via one of the two programs that stand as strange mirror opposites: those that give preferential treatment to the sons and daughters of alumni, and those that extend it to the children of unrepresented minorities. The latter practice suggests that generations of injustice and prejudice can be redressed by admission to a fancy college, the former that generations of inclusion and privilege demand their own special prize; the two philosophies would seem to cancel one another out, but each has its place in the larger system. In fact, when you account for all of the â€œhookedâ€ seats in the freshman classâ€”spaces specifically set aside for kids who have some kind of recruited talent or family connection or who come from an underrepresented minority groupâ€”you accomplish, at the most selective colleges, two things: you fill a large percentage of the class (some researchers believe the figure is as high as 60 percent), and you do so with kids whose average grades and scores are significantly lower than your ideal. Now itâ€™s time to swing a meritocracy into place; the caliber of the class is at stake. All of the unhooked students are now going to be thrown into a hypercompetitive pool, the likes of which the layperson canâ€™t imagine. As daunting as the median grades and test scores of the typical Princeton admittee may appear, those statistics have taken into account all of the legacies and volleyball players and rich peopleâ€™s children who pushed the averages down. The colleges are looking for one very specific quality at this point in the cycle: not â€œcreativityâ€ or â€œimaginationâ€ (or the ability to say funny things at the dinner table and make perceptive comments about moviesâ€”a knack todayâ€™s parents tend to call â€œcritical thinkingâ€); what they are looking for are the most deeply smart students in the country. … Chua has accepted, in a way that the good mothers will not, that most children today canâ€™t have it both ways: they canâ€™t have a fun, low-stress childhood and also an Ivy League education. She understood early onâ€”as the good mothers are about to learn, when the heartbreaking e-mails and letters from the top colleges go out this monthâ€”that life is a series of choices, each with its own rewards and consequences. In a sense, that is the most unpalatable message of her book, the one that has caused all the anguish: itâ€™s an unwelcome reminder (how can we keep forgetting this?) that the world really doesnâ€™t lie before us like a land of dreams. At bestâ€”at the very bestâ€”it can only offer us choices between two good things, and as we grasp at one, we lose the other forever. – The Atlantic By overselling education, and putting political requirements on it, we’ve created a horrific rat race. Either you study all the time and have a soul, or you grow up stunted having spent your youth entirely on becoming an elite student with an elite future. And as we see with many of the graduates of our top schools, automatons do not do so well in creative or unconventional thinking. In fact, they can be a force of entropy that knows too well what has been done and is lost beyond that. On the other hand, America has oversold itself via the notion that all of us are special, when only a few of us are Beethovens or Watsons: Americans have been told always to encourage their kids. This, the theory goes, will improve their self-esteem, and this, in turn, will help them learn. After a generation or so of applying this theory, we have the results. Just about the only category in which American students outperform the competition is self-regard. Researchers at the Brookings Institution, in one of their frequent studies of education policy, compared studentsâ€™ assessments of their abilities in math with their scores on a standardized test. Nearly forty per cent of American eighth graders agreed â€œa lotâ€ with the statement â€œI usually do well in mathematics,â€ even though only seven per cent of American students actually got enough correct answers on the test to qualify as advanced. Among Singaporean students, eighteen per cent said they usually did well in math; forty-four per cent qualified as advanced. As the Brookings researchers pointed out, even the least self-confident Singaporean students, on average, outscored the most self-confident Americans. You can say itâ€™s sad that kids in Singapore are so beaten down that they canâ€™t appreciate their own accomplishments. But youâ€™ve got to give them this: at least they get the math right. – The New Yorker The dream is that everyone is equal and if you just work hard, you’ll end up being a Beethoven. The reality is that geniuses are born and develop with talent, and a high-pressure society produces lots of very competent imitators but crushes any genius, and that in the meantime, we’ve made life so competitive we are sacrificing joy in our own existence for the illusory possibility of really striking it rich. Our high-materialism lifestyle has other consequences as well: Children who suffer psychological problems â€“ such as trauma over their parents divorcing â€“ earn up to 30 per cent less than others when they grow up, a study revealed yesterday. It warned that psychological problems in childhood have a more severe long-term impact than physical conditions such as speech defects because they persist through life. Children who had psychological problems typically grew up to earn Â£215,000 less during their lifetimes than those who did not, the study found. This figure is for total â€˜family incomeâ€™, including the earnings of a spouse or partner, and is calculated after tax. – The Daily Mail Like so many other things, the sexual revolution was sold to us by people claiming to act in our best interests. End fighting over sex — just give it away! This will be most convenient for you as an individual, so join us to get this right. We find out a generation or two later that it’s actually quite destructive, but no one was thinking about that at the time. The greedy little monkeys were thinking about how it would help them to get their little wicks wet, not what it might do to their country and future generations. In fact, we could say that parents whether slacker or disciplinarian are projecting themselves onto their kids, trying to live through their kids. We could point to the rising fascination with media as similar escapism. No one wants to live their own life. Everyone wants escape to a simpler world. Warning: The Super-Rich Delusion has pushed us to the edge of a great precipice: Remember the Roaring Twenties? The Crash of 1929? Great Depression? Just days before the crash one leading economist, Irving Fisher, predicted that stocks had â€œreached what looks like a permanently high plateau.â€ Yes, he was trapped in the â€œGreat Gatsby Syndrome,â€ an earlier version of todayâ€™s Super-Rich Delusion. It was so blinding in 1929 that the president, Wall Street, all America were sucked in â€¦ until the critical mass hit a mysterious flash point, triggering the crash. Yes, weâ€™re reliving that past â€” never learn, canâ€™t hear. And oddly itâ€™s not just the GOPâ€™s overreach, the endlessly compromising Obama, too-greedy-to-fail Wall Street banksters, U.S. Chamber of Commerce billionaires and arrogant Forbes 400. Americaâ€™s entire political, financial and economic psyche is infected, as if our DNA has been rewired. The Collective American Brain is trapped in this Super-Rich Delusion, replaying the run-up to the â€™29 Crash. – Market Watch Blame the super-rich if you want, but more likely, blame the audience for the product. The American people wanted easy answers and simple dreams. They got them. The salesman did not mention the side-effects, which were that the country would perish in confusion. We spread our money so thin it lost value, and then hammered it home by basing its value on our ability to sell each other paper and banner ads on the internet. We socialized our culture, our sexuality, and opened our borders to people from all lands. Each of these decisions were errors. We watched the right hand, which promised more of the good, and ignored the left, which behind the scenes destroyed all that was good and already existing. As the long-term consequences of those acts begin to show, we’re starting to see how badly we were scammed."
"Harry Reid is the biggest barrier between Americans and less debt, Martha Roby says. | AP Photos By JONATHAN ALLEN and MARIN COGAN 03/30/2011 12:19 PM EDT Freshmen House members are taking a hard line against Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid in the politics of passing a temporary spending bill—with one freshman vowing not to settle for a “split the baby strategy” on spending cuts. “The biggest barrier between the American people and a government of less spending, less borrowing, and less debt is Harry Reid and the Democrats in the Senate,” said Martha Roby, a freshman Republican from Alabama, noting the controversial policy riders in the bill that would defund Planned Parenthood and scale back the EPA. “The Senate Democrats are ducking it all. They want to frame the debate as one within the Republican caucus but the American people are not buying it. The fight is between Republicans in Washington who want to cut spending and democrats who want to defend it,” Roby said. “We will not settle for a ‘split the baby strategy,’ and it is time for the Democrats to respond,” she said, declining later to say whether any compromise was possible. The comments of the freshmen, coming a day before tea party protests at the Capitol, increases the pressure not only on Reid, but on House Speaker John Boehner. Boehner goes unnamed in their complaints, but he is the one caught between cutting a deal with Senate Democrats to keep the government running and satisfy the tea party wing of his conference. The freshmen met for a press conference outside the Capitol Wednesday morning organized by Rep. Rick Crawford. Crawford and his colleagues delivered a letter to Reid imploring him to make “reasonable, responsible spending cuts”— and promising to protest daily until he does. “Mr. Reid, your record on spending in the Senate is one of failure,” says the letter, written by Arkansas Rep. Rick Crawford, a former radio broadcaster. “You have failed to pass a budget, failed to restrain spending, and failed to put our country on sound fiscal footing. We do not accept your failure as our own. The American people did not send us here to fail. That’s not to say freshman Republicans won’t move off their hard line — just that they prefer not to give ground easily. Rep. Vicky Hartzler (R-Mo.), who represents Fort Leonard Wood, said the Senate’s decision not to pass a counterproposal amounted to a “dereliction of duty” by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. “He’s threatening a federal shutdown,” Hartzler said. “That’s not our plan, our plan is to lead and we have led. It’s time for him now to in good faith move forward with what needs to be done to cut spending, to pass a cr so we can get into talking about a 2012 budget, which is what we’re supposed to be doing.” Other Republican freshmen said this is one of many attempts in coming days to push the Senate on a continuing resolution, including a Tea Party rally held at the Capitol tomorrow. “The American people sent us into the Congress of the United States to do the peoples’ job, and we have done it,” Texas Rep. Quico Canseco said. “We’re here to implore the Senate to do something. If they’ve got enough time to go and pass bills like the March 11 national or international plumbing day, then they can certainly look at our continuing resolution,” Canseco said.

"by Brett Stevens on March 30, 2011 In an age of lies, the truth is seen as a lie. You don’t get to an age of lies without massive decay. An age of lies is also an age of a dying civilization. That means that every weak-willed person clusters around some familiar lies, and chants them like a catechism, bleating out their terror as their voices get stronger. They have the power to shout you down because they have greater numbers. What they don’t have is any relation to reality, so they’re schizoid: drunk on the power they have for social reasons, and terrified in denial of their imminent downfall through the confrontation between their lies and reality. We live in an age of great taboos that we cannot speak “officially” or we become ostracized by All the Good People, who think our ideas are horrible and barbaric, and because they all agree with each other in a circular echo chamber, they can afford to deny us — for now: All this leads up to a simple reality: problems ahead, people refuse to see them, and so we’ve created taboos around any discussion of these problems. You think you live in a free society? It’s “free” in that you can do anything, until society decides your thoughts or actions were inconvenient and throws your behind into a court situation: Geert Wilders, the far-Right Dutch MP will face trial on charges of incited hatred and discriminations against Muslims, after a judge rejected a request to dismiss the case. Mr Wilders was charged with insulting Muslims by comparing Islam to Nazism. The case has attracted considerable attention, not just because of Mr Wilders’ controversial comments, but also because of the increasing influence of his Freedom Party, which provides support for the Dutch minority government on key issues. Following a brief adjournment, judges, prosecutors and the defence agreed for the trial to resume on April 13 with key witness testimony. If found guilty, he could face up to a year in jail of a 7,600 euro (Â£6,700) fine. – The Telegraph Let me ask you there, fellow Comrade Citizen, why is this man in jail? Well, he said some bad things. So we are thinking of jailing him for his opinion or ideas? Well, no, we’re trying to put him in jail because his words will cause people to be upset, and that could cause disruption in our social order. I see. I’m sure similar dramas played out in ancient Greece and Rome, in the failing Maya and Aztec empires, even in the collapsing kingdoms of ancient India, Angkor Wat, Easter Island, China and even failing Amerind societies like the Hopi. Make sure you kill that messenger. If you get rid of him, maybe the trouble will go away because no one will be saying anything offensive, and we’ll all get along. Except that never works. It just causes resentment to smolder. Eventually, it explodes. And while we’re fiddling away here in the palace, what’s happening to Rome — errr, our planet? A growing, more affluent population competing for ever scarcer resources could make for an “unrecognizable” world by 2050, researchers warned at a major US science conference Sunday. The United Nations has predicted the global population will reach seven billion this year, and climb to nine billion by 2050, “with almost all of the growth occurring in poor countries, particularly Africa and South Asia,” said John Bongaarts of the non-profit Population Council. The swelling population will exacerbate problems, such as resource depletion, said John Casterline, director of the Initiative in Population Research at Ohio State University. But incomes are also expected to rise over the next 40 years — tripling globally and quintupling in developing nations — and add more strain to global food supplies. People tend to move up the food chain as their incomes rise, consuming more meat than they might have when they made less money, the experts said. – Discovery Because our leadership is based in what is popular, not what is realistic/truthful, we’re unable to deal with our real problems. Fake, symbolic, emotional attention-getters? Sure, let’s keep talking about Libya, racism, abortion, inequality, al-Qaeda, legal marijuana and socialized medicine. These actually have really minor consequences in the big picture. Most of all, don’t do anything to inconvenience each other. Don’t rock the boat — your neighbor wants a bigger house, two SUVs, more plastic junk from Wal-mart. You just want to get through college into that profitable career and to do the same. You two agree: don’t rock the boat. Ignore these problems, at least until we make our pile and retire, and then it’s someone else’s problem. Large corporations? Satan? Fascists? No, those aren’t our problem… it’s this simple mechanism. People deciding not to do the inconvenient, unpopular and thus unprofitable. We have inverted all values. Truths — ideas which correspond to what we can expect from reality, given a certain path — are proclaimed to be Lies; truth-tellers are called criminals and thrown in jail. And the crazy train rattles on, out of control, with no one at the wheel. Tags: crowdism, ecocide"
"Earlier today pollster Frank Luntz critiqued our union ad on Fox News. The conclusion derived from his focus group of Democrat, Republican and Independent voters was that OUR AD WORKS!

We have been testing ads in Wisconsin for the last two months and almost all of them have failed… Either they appeal to Republican partisans or Democrat partisans but not both until the Republican Trust [GOP Trust] came in. This is one of the rare times in American politics today when a very clear, very tough message appeals across the political spectrum… They set the proper context… They set the proper tone. – Frank Luntz, Fox News Channel, America Live 3/30/2011. The GOP Trust has been blanketing the airwaves with this ad because of the tremendous support of conservatives like you. Our effort is resonating with everyone, no matter their party affiliation, and turning the tide in the all-important battle for public opinion.

Watch Frank Luntz Review Our Ad The fight against Big Labor has only just begun and the battleground is quickly spreading into many key states. The battle in Wisconsin is far from over with a judge again blocking implementation of the legislation. Now more than 18 states are considering legislation to significantly rein in public and private sector unions. They need our support! · Ohio – The Governor is just days away from signing a bill to limit collective bargaining. · Florida – The House passed a bill banning mandatory dues for public unions and the legislature is also debating legislation to limit teacher tenure. · Idaho – Is ready to enact legislation reforming teacher tenure. · Iowa – The House of Representatives is currently debating legislation to curb collective bargaining rights for government employees. · Michigan – The Michigan legislature has approved separate measures to give the state the power to break union contracts. · Indiana – The House Democrats are back at work after a five-week boycott to protest the bill passed by the Indiana Senate a bill to limit public school teachers’ collective bargaining. · New Hampshire – The House passed a right-to-work bill that prohibits public sector workers from being required to join labor unions. · Kansas – The House passed legislation outlawing employee payroll deductions for union dues and political action committees. · Tennessee – The Senate Education Committee just passed a bill that would end teachers’ rights to working conditions through collective bargaining. At least 9 Other States – have introduced legislation to limit on public worker collective bargaining: Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Nebraska, Nevada, Oklahoma, New Mexico and Washington. Other measures are popping up every day! As Obama said, “elections have consequences.” And for once I agree with Obama. Yes, Mr. President elections do have consequences and now it is time to take back our country and restore fiscal discipline. The best investment of 2011 is to crush the Democrat Party’s base.

"This may be the first time that this particular permutation of “apology” has been offered for dropping a C-bomb on someone. A forthright apology would be one thing, a “sorry if you were offended” dismissal would be another, but he’s almost trying to mesh the two. E.g., yeah, she really is a c*** — but I hope she doesn’t take it personally. It’s as if Don Rickles ran through a set and ended with, “Seriously, though, I meant every word.” In fact, I always thought one of the reasons the left likes Maher is that he clearly does mean to hurt the feelings of his targets. He’s trying to draw blood from their political enemies and they appreciate him for it. So why not own it? Two clips here, one of Maher and the other via Mediaite of KP from last night’s Greta lamenting that anyone, let alone a “progressive,” can get away with sexist insults without being called on it. Serious question: Is it even worth posting stuff like this at this point? He’s a provocateur who clearly revels in the attention; Palin herself seems inclined to ignore him going forward; and apart from the occasional complaints from Kirsten and a few other principled liberal feminists, his lefty fans are going to shrug it off no matter how much attention is called to it. Why even bother? Click the first image to watch. "
"On CNN this morning, former CIA Counterterrorism analyst Michael Scheuer appeared with Kiran Chetry and Christine Romans and was not happy with President Obama’s actions in Libya. Scheuer is not optimistic about success in the country and wasn’t pleased to hear Romans offer up any possible rationale for American intervention there. Scheuer was adamant that the U.S. should never have gotten involved in Libya because “I’m not sure that the opposition, if it takes power, is going to be much better than was Gaddafi.” Arguing that Libya was “none of our business,” Scheuer fears that our involvement will be a recruiting tool for extremists, since “in the Muslim world this is Americans killing Muslims again, and it looks like it’s for oil.” The increasingly tense interview got a little more uncomfortable when Scheur referred to “the rather crazed Ms. Rice at the UN” and Romans took exception to the description. Scheuer then concluded that when no American interests are at stake, we should not be spending money “at a time when we’re nearly bankrupt.” However, Romans disagreed with the argument, suggesting that the problems in the national economy and Libya were two separarte issues. Scheuer laughed and attacked back, “they’re not separate issues ma’am, you’re just carrying the water for Mr. Obama.” Romans, not eager for that to be the last word, passionately responded, “I’m certainly not carrying anyone’s water! And, I will assure you of that.” Watch the clip from CNN below: (h/t Johnny Dollar) Have a tip we should know? tips@.com Have a tip or story idea? Email us. Or to keep it anonymous, click here."
"One thing I will never understand is how people can take radio entertainers seriously. They can be fun to listen to. But you would have to be a complete dolt to accept the idea that the same guy who's selling you dog food one minute is going to dispense wisdom the next. As I noted in a prior post, Mark Levin may be the worst of these guys for the simple reason that he pretends to be a constitutional scholar. Nonsense. His on-the-air rants show he has no idea of the nature of American conservative thought. As for his books, well here's an excerpt from ""Liberty and Tyranny."" Note the excessive use of capital letters, by the way. This is the mark of the lowbrow. What the hell? You can certainly argue that communism and socialism stress equality. But monarchism? Feudalism? Does Levin believe the king and lords considered themselves the equals of their subjects? The whole book is filled with such misconceptions about the nature of government. I'm sure he's trying his best, but someone who thinks kings believe in equality should try chess, not politics. NOTE: I'm getting some really dreadful responses here from Levin listeners. Let me help you stick to the subject. Levin is stating here that the primary organizing principle between two hierarchical systems, monarchy and feudalism, is equality. If you can explain how a hierarchical system with many gradations of social class can be based on equality, please do so. Otherwise, don't comment. A QUIZ: While we're on the subject of Levin's rather bizarre notion that monarchy is based on equality, can anyone name the author of the following quote?

"Advertisement Long-term and worsening unemployment, economic stagnation, labor revolt and a state of siege. Those are just some of the descriptions of one country that received the kind of economic ""shock therapy"" crafted by Columbia professor Jeffrey Sachs, who sits on the board of an organization literally seeking to reorganize the entire global economic system. Advertisement - story continues below That group is the Institute for New Economic Thinking, or INET. Philanthropist George Soros is INET's founding sponsor, with the billionaire having provided a reported $25 million over five years to support INET activities. TRENDING: Christian superstar urges faithful to demand probe of Afghanistan catastrophe This Friday, INET starts its four-day economic symposium in the mountains of Bretton Woods, N.H. Get ""The Fall Of America And The Western World,"" featuring more than eight hours of exclusive interviews with top experts offering their perspectives on why America and the Western World are headed for collapse. Advertisement - story continues below The gathering of economic giants will take place at Mount Washington Hotel, famous for hosting the original Bretton Woods economic agreements drafted in 1944. That conference's goal was to rebuild a post-World War II international monetary system. The April gathering has a similar goal in mind – a global economic restructuring. Reporting on last year's event, the Business Insider related, ""George Soros has brought together a crack team of the world's top economists and financial thinkers."" ""Its aim,"" continued the business newspaper, ""to remake the world's economy as they see fit."" More than two-thirds of the slated speakers at this year's conference have direct ties to Soros. Advertisement - story continues below One of the keynotes is Sachs, who sits in INET's advisory council. Sachs, a special adviser to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, is founder and co-president of the Soros-funded Millennium Promise Alliance, a nonprofit organization that says it is dedicated to ending extreme poverty and hunger. RELATED: Omar calls for U.N. authority over U.S. border crisis Global taxes With $50 million in capital from Soros, Millennium promotes a global economy while urging cooperation and investment from international banks and the United Nations Development Program. Advertisement - story continues below The group helped to found the United Nations Millennium Development Goal, a move that was advanced by Sachs. He served as director from 2002 to 2006. The U.N. Millennium Development Goal has demanded the imposition of international taxes as part of a stated effort of ""eradicating extreme poverty, reducing child mortality rates, fighting disease epidemics such as AIDS, and developing a global partnership for development."" Investor's Business Daily reported the Millennium goal called for a ""currency transfer tax,"" a ""tax on the rental value of land and natural resources,"" a ""royalty on worldwide fossil energy projection — oil, natural gas, coal,"" ""fees for the commercial use of the oceans, fees for airplane use of the skies, fees for use of the electromagnetic spectrum, fees on foreign exchange transactions, and a tax on the carbon content of fuels."" Indeed, last September, a group of 60 nations, including France, Britain and Japan, propose at the U.N. summit on the Millennium Development Goals that a tax be introduced on international currency transactions to raise funds for development aid. Advertisement - story continues below The proposed 0.005 percent tax on currency transactions would raise as much as $35 billion a year in development aid, claimed the proponents. 'Shock therapy' Sachs, meanwhile, is a renowned international economist best known for his work as an economic adviser to governments in Latin America, Eastern Europe, and the former Soviet Union. He directs Columbia's Earth Institute, which promotes the theory of global warming. Advertisement - story continues below Sachs has been a World Bank consultant who formerly directed Harvard's Institute for International Development, which he turned into a major conduit advocating for World Bank and International Monetary Funds use for structural adjustment programs in the Third World and beyond. Sachs is engineer of a ""shock treatment"" economic doctrine that he has applied to other countries, most notably Bolivia and Poland. In both countries, critics charge, Sach's doctrine led to economic failure. In 1985, Bolivia was plagued by hyperinflation and was unable to pay back its debt to the International Monetary Fund. Sachs drew up an extensive plan for Bolivia, later known as ""shock therapy,"" to drastically cut inflation by scrapping all subsidies, price controls, restrictions on exports, imports and private business activity. Advertisement - story continues below He also called for the linking of the Bolivian economy with a more global currency, at the time the U.S. dollar. Sachs acknowledged that a sudden shift to a market economy would initially result in huge price rises, especially in food and energy. But he has argued prices would level off as new supplies reached the market in response to the rises. In Bolivia, the Sachs plan did beat inflation, but the price was continuing high unemployment, economic stagnation, labor revolt, a state of siege and a deepening involvement in the international drug market, reports noted. To beat the hyperinflation under Sach's plan, Bolivia ensured a large number of workers were laid off while others' salaries were slashed, leading to widespread workers strikes. Advertisement - story continues below The Bolivian government imposed a state of siege in response to a wave of strikes. Sachs attempted a similar plan in Poland in the late 1980s, including the full convertibility of the zloty, the Polish currency, to U.S. dollars, and immediate suspension of debt repayment. Another plan was deployed in Argentina, which has been plagued by an economic meltdown. Looking back at Sach's effect on Poland, Jon Wiener, writing in The Nation in June 1990, charged, ""Before Sachs, Poland had a problem of shortages. As soon as food and other basic goods showed up in the stores, people bought them at low, subsidized prices, so the shelves were usually empty.

"Advertisement Supported by By David Brooks It was a season of fiscal perestroika. Last fall, the Simpson-Bowles deficit commission released a bold report on how to avoid an economic catastrophe. For a few weeks, the think tanks and government offices were alive with proposals to reduce debt and reform entitlements, the tax code and just about every other government program. The mood did not last. The polls suggested that voters were still unwilling to accept tax increases or benefit cuts. Smart Washington insiders like Mitch McConnell and President Obama decided that any party that actually tried to implement these ideas would be committing political suicide. The president walked away from the Simpson-Bowles package. Far from addressing the fiscal problems, the president’s budget would double the nation’s debt over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. But the forces of reform have not been entirely silenced. Over the past few weeks, a number of groups, including the ex-chairmen of the Council of Economic Advisers and 64 prominent budget experts, have issued letters arguing that the debt situation is so dire that doing nothing is not a survivable option. What they lacked was courageous political leadership — a powerful elected official willing to issue a proposal, willing to take a stand, willing to face the political perils. The country lacked that leadership until today. Today, Paul Ryan, the Republican chairman of the House Budget Committee, is scheduled to release the most comprehensive and most courageous budget reform proposal any of us have seen in our lifetimes. Ryan is expected to leap into the vacuum left by the president’s passivity. The Ryan budget will not be enacted this year, but it will immediately reframe the domestic policy debate. His proposal will set the standard of seriousness for anybody who wants to play in this discussion. It will become the 2012 Republican platform, no matter who is the nominee. Any candidate hoping to win that nomination will have to be able to talk about government programs with this degree of specificity, so it will improve the G.O.P. primary race. The Ryan proposal will help settle the fight over the government shutdown and the 2011 budget because it will remind everybody that the real argument is not about cutting a few billion here or there. It is about the underlying architecture of domestic programs in 2012 and beyond. The Ryan budget will put all future arguments in the proper context: The current welfare state is simply unsustainable and anybody who is serious, on left or right, has to have a new vision of the social contract. The initial coverage will talk about Ryan’s top number — the cuts of more than $4 trillion over the next decade. But the important thing is the way Ryan would reform programs. He would reform the tax code along the Simpson-Bowles lines, but without the tax increases. (It’s amazing that a budget chairman could include tax policy in his proposal, since it’s normally under the purview of the Ways and Means Committee.) The Ryan budget doesn’t touch Medicare for anybody over 55, but for younger people it turns it into a defined contribution plan. Instead of assuming open-ended future costs, the government will give you a sum of money (starting at an amount equal to what the government now spends) and a regulated menu of insurance options from which to choose. The Ryan budget will please governors of both parties by turning Medicaid into a block grant — giving states more flexibility. It tackles agriculture subsidies and other corporate welfare. It consolidates the job-training programs into a single adult scholarship. It reforms housing assistance and food stamps. It dodges Social Security. The Republicans still have no alternative to the Democratic health care reform, but this budget tackles just about every politically risky issue with brio and guts. Ryan was a protégé of Jack Kemp, and Kemp’s uplifting spirit pervades the document. It’s not sour, taking an austere meat ax approach. It emphasizes social support, social mobility and personal choice. I don’t agree with all of it that I’ve seen, but it is a serious effort to create a sustainable welfare state — to prevent the sort of disruptive change we’re going to face if national bankruptcy comes. It also creates the pivotal moment of truth for President Obama. Will he come up with his own counterproposal, or will he simply demagogue the issue by railing against “savage” Republican cuts and ignoring the long-term fiscal realities? Does he have a sustainable vision for government, or will he just try to rise above the fray while Nancy Pelosi and others attack Ryan? And what about the Senate Republicans? Where do they stand? Or the voters? Are they willing to face reality or will they continue to demand more government than they are willing to pay for? Paul Ryan has grasped reality with both hands. He’s forcing everybody else to do the same. Advertisement"
"Posted by Judd Weiss on May 19, 2010 at 7:09 am, filed in Politics, Movies Today I just saw the new Robin Hood movie directed by Ridley Scott. I was SURPRISED. Not just because I liked it better than I thought I would. Not because it was political, but because the message was so different from what you expect of the man who steals from the rich to give to the poor. And mostly that the message was so eloquently SPOT ON. I never judge a movie’s quality by what it’s trying to say. I judge it by how well it says it. Avatar was an amazing movie, expressed itself powerfully, even though its message was juvenile. Not only did Robin Hood have an excellent message, but it brought it out in dramatic form so expertly. This movie was about taxes. Yes, taxes. And it drives home the point of what taxes mean in the backstory. Showing how in 12th Century England people of the country are breaking their backs to support themselves in harsh times, only to see what they’ve produced and earned ripped from their hands by rulers demanding that everyone pay their fair share. Their fare share for the rulers’ endless wars and other endless expensive spending projects. Eventually it gets to be too much and the people organize together in mass for a tax revolt. Hmm… Tea Party? I’m google-ing online now and finding many critics are very upset that this is not the classic steal from the rich to give to the poor Robin Hood. There’s no other such socialist undertones that imply rising higher than others is inherently wrong. No, instead there’s a demand on the King that a charter be drafted to limit his powers so that he cannot spend or tax without the consent of the governed. Robin Hood shouts to the crowd “What we ask for is Liberty. Liberty by Law!”, and makes the case to the King that a land of free people will create a stronger more prosperous England, as well as create citizens more loyal than any King enjoys. [Check out the Trailer Below] Yup, the movie’s message is a nearly explicit rallying cry for the Tea Party movement. And feels like an attack on both Bush and Obama. I couldn’t agree more with the libertarian points it makes viscerally. That yes, we do happen to use the government services we are taxed for, but to assume that any ruler can and should make better spending decisions with your income than you, it’s not only presumptuous, it is villainous. It’s theft, it’s brutal and it’s hurting your life. And for what? For inferior services operated by unaccountable self righteous “princely” bureaucrats. Of course this is not just a political story. It’s a cool movie otherwise; intelligent and engaging. The backstory of injustice affects all the subplots and drives the theme of finding strength and courage and rising up to face challenges head on. The motto repeated throughout the movie is “Rise and Rise Again, Until Lambs become Lions”. This is an epic action film, brutal and bloody, and in line with Braveheart. The acting was great, Cate Blanchett was phenomenal, Russel Crowe was powerful, the production was engaging, and Ridley Scott continues to be incapable of directing anything less than excellent. It probably should have been titled “Robin Hood Begins” because it’s a prequel that leaves off where the classic tale begins. The story was a little hard to follow at the beginning, but it all makes sense in short time. At over 2 1/2 hours, you are hereby warned not to get a large drink. Honestly, I had no desire to see Robin Hood, I never gave a damn about the classic story. A friend asked me to join him today and gave me only 15 minutes notice. I’m glad I didn’t turn him down. I have no doubt that Ridley Scott and the writer Brian Helgeland would deny any connection with the Tea Party, and I’m sure this movie has nothing directly to do with that movement. Still, it explicitly and strongly supports the same ideals that the Tea Party stands for, so I can safely say, if you want to understand what the Tea Party is actually about, this movie serves as an excellent introduction.

"Save 40% on Digital Subscriptions Scientists see the beginnings of racism in monkeys Update (1/24/14): The study reported in this article was retracted from the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology in December 2013 at the request of the authors. The reason for the retraction was the researchers’ discovery that the results could not be independently replicated by lab members due to inaccurate coding performed by one of the co-authors. For more information about the retraction, including an explanation by principal investigator Laurie Santos, please visit this link:  Psychologists have long known that many people are prejudiced towards others based on group affiliations, be they racial, ethnic, religious, or even political. However, we know far less about why people are prone to prejudice in the first place. New research, using monkeys, suggests that the roots lie deep in our evolutionary past. Yale graduate student Neha Mahajan, along with a team of psychologists, traveled to Cayo Santiago, an uninhabited island southeast of Puerto Rico also known as “Monkey Island,” in order to study the behavior of rhesus monkeys. Like humans, rhesus monkeys live in groups and form strong social bonds. The monkeys also tend to be wary of those they perceive as potentially threatening. To figure out whether monkeys distinguish between insiders (i.e. those who belong to their group) and outsiders (i.e. those who don’t belong), the researchers measured the amount of time the monkeys stared at the photographed face of an insider versus outsider monkey. Across several experiments, they found that the monkeys stared longer at the faces of outsiders. This would suggest that monkeys were more wary of outsider faces. However, it is also possible that outsiders simply evoke more curiosity. To rule this out, the researchers took advantage of the fact that male rhesus monkeys leave their childhood groups once they reach reproductive age. This allowed the researchers to pair familiar outsider faces (monkeys that had recently left the group) with less familiar insider faces (monkeys that had recently joined the group). When presented with these pairs, the monkeys continued to stare longer at outsider faces, even though they were more familiar with them. The monkeys were clearly making distinctions based on group membership. Mahajan and her team also devised a method for figuring out whether the monkeys harbor negative feelings towards outsiders. They created a monkey-friendly version of the Implicit Association Test (IAT). For humans, the IAT is a computer-based task that measures unconscious biases by determining how quickly we associate different words (e.g. “good” and “bad”) with specific groups (e.g. faces of either African-Americans or European-Americans). If a person is quicker to associate “bad” with African-American faces compared to European-American faces, this suggests that he or she harbors an implicit bias against African-Americans. For the rhesus monkeys, the researchers paired the photos of insider andoutsider monkeys with either good things, such as fruits, or bad things, such as spiders. When an insider face was paired with fruit, or an outsider face was paired with a spider, the monkeys quickly lost interest. But when an insider face was paired with a spider, the monkeys looked longer at the photographs. Presumably, the monkeys found it confusing when something good was paired with something bad. This suggests that monkeys not only distinguish between insiders and outsiders, they associate insiders with good things and outsiders with bad things. Overall, the results support an evolutionary basis for prejudice. Some researchers believe prejudice is unique to humans, since it seems to depend on complex thought processes. For example, past studies have found that people are likely to display prejudice after being reminded of their mortality, or after receiving a blow to their self-esteem. Since only humans are capable of contemplating their deaths or their self-image, these studies reinforce the view that only humans are capable of prejudice. But the behavior of the rhesus monkeys implies that our basic tendency to see the world in terms of “us” and “them” has ancient origins. Psychologist Catherine Cottrell at the University of Florida and her colleague Steven Neuberg at Arizona State University, argue that human prejudice evolved as a function of group living. Joining together in groups allowed humans to gain access to resources necessary for survival including food, water, and shelter. Groups also offered numerous advantages, such as making it easier to find a mate, care for children, and receive protection from others. However, group living also made us more wary of outsiders who could potentially harm the group by spreading disease, killing or hurting individuals, or stealing precious resources. To protect ourselves, we developed ways of identifying who belongs to our group and who doesn’t. Over time, this process of quickly evaluating others might have become so streamlined that it became unconscious. Psychologists have long known that many of our prejudices operate automatically, without us even being aware of them. Most people, even those who care deeply about equality, show some level of prejudice towards other groups when tested using the IAT. Despite this overwhelming evidence that our brains are wired for bias, our society continues to think about prejudice as premeditated behavior. Our current laws against discrimination, as well as the majority of diversity training programs, assume that prejudice is overt and intentional. Rarely do we teach people about how automatic prejudices might taint their behavior towards others. The fact that prejudice often occurs automatically doesn’t mean we can’t find ways of overcoming its negative effects. For example, there is evidence that when people are made aware of their automatic prejudices, they can self-correct. And when we are encouraged to take the perspective of an outsider, it reduces our automatic prejudice towards that person’s group. Given that most of the difficult conflicts we face in the world today originate from clashes between social groups, it makes sense to devote time to understanding how to reduce our biases. But our evolutionary past suggests that in order to be effective, we may need to adopt a new approach. Often we focus more on political, historical, and cultural factors rather than the underlying patterns of thinking that fuel all conflicts. By taking into account the extent to which prejudice is deeply rooted in our brains, we have a better chance of coming up with long-term solutions that work with, rather than against, our natural tendencies.

"Link copied. We want to bridge divides to reach everyone. The health-care law's 'individual mandate' is vulnerable to the Supreme Court deciding that Americans cannot be forced to buy health insurance. Kennedy's reasoning in a decision issued Monday hints at his worries. His vote will be pivotal. April 5, 2011 Get ready, Congress. Anthony Kennedy, the pivotal justice in most of the split decisions by the Supreme Court, may have just tipped his hand on how he might rule in a likely case involving the one-year-old health-care law. Justice Kennedy’s reasoning in a ruling issued Monday about tax credits to help private schools in Arizona could easily be applied to a critical piece of President Obama’s major legislative achievement. A key provision of that 2010 law is the “individual mandate.” It requires most Americans to buy health insurance or face a hefty fine. Such an imposition on private health choices is based on an unproven assertion that everyone at some point will use a hospital emergency room. (The mandate also provides the major funding to achieve universal health care.) But in writing for the court’s majority in Monday’s ruling, Kennedy warns against government action based on hypotheticals or conjecture. Courts especially should not endorse mere speculation and must instead deal with actual or imminent situations. He argues against making inferences about “premises as to which there remains considerable doubt” or that are “not particular to certain persons.” Such general language reflects Kennedy’s long-held caution about government overreach – which could include the health-care mandate. The justice also is often concerned about liberty of conscience, as he noted in this latest ruling. His approach won the day in the 5-to-4 decision involving an Arizona program that allows individuals to keep $500 of income that they might owe the state if they give that money to groups that provide private-school scholarships for needy children. The program was set up in 1997 to get around a state ban on school vouchers. It has so far benefited more than 27,000 students, many of whom were stuck in low-performing public schools. A few other states have similar programs, and others may follow. The high court was not asked to rule on whether the state is supporting religion – which would be a First Amendment violation. Its decision was on the question of whether a group of taxpayers simply had legal standing to challenge the state program because some money flows to religious schools. The case focused on whether a tax credit is the same as government spending. The four justices in the minority, writing in dissent, saw any tax leniency as a subsidy or a form of government finance. Their presumption is that a taxpayer’s money is state money unless government determines not to take it. And to “divert” private money away from state coffers for use by religious groups is, in effect, “monetary support” of religion. Not so, the majority justices found. “When Arizona taxpayers choose to contribute [to a school tuition group], they spend their own money,” the ruling stated. A taxpayer whose dollars are spent by the state to support a religion does indeed have a right to challenge the use of that tax money. But a tax credit, Kennedy wrote, “is not tantamount to a religious tax or tithe.” In fact, money can only be government property if it comes “into the tax collector’s hands.” Under the Arizona program, the contributions to the scholarship organizations result from a decision by “private taxpayers regarding their own funds” and “in accordance with their own consciences,” he stated. Taxpayers who object “know that their fellow citizens, not the state, decide to contribute and in fact make the contribution.” And those taxpayers follow their own conscience. “Private bank accounts cannot be equated with the Arizona State Treasury,” stated the ruling bluntly. What’s more, any injury to the state’s tax coffers is merely speculative. There’s no evidence of the state being unable to raise sufficient funds, the court decided. It is mere conjecture that a taxpayer suffers because this tax credit might reduce revenue to the state. Note the concepts here – speculative and conjectural – that could also apply to the premise of the health-care mandate, which is that everyone will someday use medical care at the expense of others. Kennedy makes clear that any legal standing for taxpayers on church-state issues should be based on specific injury, not theoretical causation. The same reasoning could easily apply to the various federal court cases on the health-care mandate now working their way up to the Supreme Court. Oddly, the Obama administration filed a brief in support of the Arizona law. And the president has hinted lately that he might seek some compromise on the individual mandate, perhaps letting states decide the matter. But the final decision on the mandate will likely rest with Kennedy in yet another 5-to-4 decision. If he used this Arizona ruling to hint at what he might do, it was certainly a very big wink.

"A leading-edge research firm focused on digital transformation. Good Subscriber Account active since Namely, where the $4.4 trillion of the $6.2 trillion of ""savings"" are going to come from. Ryan doesn't have the balls to actually specify these cuts: He just proposes capping federal spending at 20% of GDP. In the absence of specifics, saying that the plan will save $6.2 trillion over 10 years is misleading. But Ryan and the Republicans deserve a lot of credit for at least acknowledging the huge fiscal mess the United States is in and proposing specific long-term remedies for dealing with it. For the last several years, the United States has acted as though it can have everything forever: All the services and benefits everyone wants while also cutting taxes. The country's $1.6 trillion ANNUAL deficit, combined with debt approaching 100% of GDP (which doesn't even factor in future healthcare and Social Security liabilities) reveal that this is a pipe dream. (See: A Short Course On Why The US Is Screwed) What can't go on forever won't. Our leaders have a duty to acknowledge the problem and propose a way out--even if the solutions are temporarily unpopular. (That's what true leadership is, by the way: Doing the right thing even when it's unpopular, and finding a way to get folks to follow and support you because you can make them understand that it's the right thing). The Republicans and Paul Ryan are at least taking steps in this direction. They are acknowledging our problem and proposing concrete steps to deal with it. The Democrats, meanwhile, are just stuffing their heads in the sand. This year's budget negotiations are pretty much irrelevant. Whether this year's budget cuts $30 billion of spending or $60 billion, the savings will be a rounding error on the overall deficit. The Democrats have yet to even acknowledge the massive long-term problem the country faces, let alone propose to solutions to it. We understand and respect the concern about whacking the budget in the midst of a fragile recovery--it's a valid one. If the Democrats were defending the minor cuts in this year's budget by proposing them in conjunction with a compelling long-term plan, we'd be more sympathetic. As it is, we can only conclude the following: The Democrats are still dreaming of a perpetual free lunch. (And they'll do and say anything to get re-elected.)

"Via Ace, Big Government’s Mike Flynn asks a very good question. During the 1995 shutdown, the Clinton Administration followed the OMB guidance issued during the Reagan Administration. The Obama Administration, it seems, is tacking a different direction. Let me be clear, the guidelines proposing to hold military paychecks are, according to the news reports, draft guidelines. It is possible the Obama Administration has abandoned these punitive guidelines. And, even if they implemented these guidelines, military personnel would most likely eventually receive their pay, once a budget agreement is reached. But, why even change the policy and subject our military to partisan political battles. The policy is certainly a change, but it doesn’t provide much hope. Hopefully, they will clear this up quickly. Read this CNN story or Air Force Times piece from last month for further background. If The One can continue payments to the military without having to agree to Boehner’s new short-term budget resolution, then why doesn’t he do it? Unless … he wants a shutdown to happen because it’ll hurt Republicans, and thinks that deliberately withholding military pay will make it that much more painful for Republicans politically when the shutdown comes. Is there any other explanation for this? There may have been some sort of legislation passed since 1995 tying the White House’s hands but I don’t see it mentioned in the CNN piece or the Federal Times story linked by Flynn and can’t find anything via Google. Speaking of Boehner’s resolution, it passed this afternoon 247-181. Fifteen Democrats voted yes and six Republicans voted no: Amash, Bachmann, Barton, Steve King, Mulvaney, and of course Ron Paul. That’s all that’s left of the 54 Republicans who voted no on Boehner’s last short-term budget because they were tired of messing around with two-week funding measures. Amazing what high-stakes negotiations can do for party unity. Below you’ll find video of Boehner and Reid after this afternoon’s failed meeting at the White House. They’re headed back there tonight for another go at 7 p.m., with Boehner now asking for cuts in the neighborhood of $39 billion and Democrats offering a package in the ballpark of $34-35 billion. A major caveat, though: In the case of the policy riders, Democrats said they have agreed to a number of the lesser Republican amendments. But there has been little give on the half-dozen highest priority items— impacting healthcare reform, family planning programs and the Federal Communications Commission’s “net-neutrality” rulemaking, for example. And Reid told Boehner that Republicans hurt their own cause this week by pushing for what proved to be a series of unsuccessful votes this week on the question of limiting the Environmental Protection Agency’s power to address global warming and greenhouse gases… When asked if there were riders Boehner would shut the government over, he said “We’re going to continue to work our way through all of this and there’s no reason to draw any lines in the sand to make this more difficult than it already is.” A fun fact about the GOP’s abortion rider to Boehner’s short-term budget, which appears to be the dealbreaker for Dingy and the rest of the gang: It hasn’t been a dealbreaker for liberals in the past. From John McCormack: This policy, known as the Dornan amendment, has previously enjoyed bipartisan support: Indeed, Reid, Biden, Pelosi, and Obama have all voted for appropriations bills that included the Dornan amendment. President Obama signed the Dornan amendment into law in the fiscal year 2009 budget. It was only removed in the summer of 2009 by House Democrats–and even then 39 Democratic members of Congress took the extraordinary step of joining House Republicans to try to take down the rule on an appropriations bill in order to keep the Dornan amendment. It’s quite amazing that Harry Reid and President Obama are now insisting that taxpayer-funding of abortion is more important than a bill that funds the troops for a year and keeps budget negotiations going for another week. Is it amazing? Democrats are also pretending tonight that it’s somehow outre to attach policy riders to budget bills at all, even though they’ve done it themselves many times in the past. Another budget update coming later, after tonight’s meeting. 30 hours from a shutdown… Visit msnbc.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy Update: Aha, there is indeed an explanation for this. Military pay in 1995 wasn’t as simple as Clinton releasing the funds. There was a defense appropriations bill in effect during that shutdown. Via Gabe Malor, a report from the Congressional Research Service: A frequent question is how this compares to the last government shutdown in 1995-1996. There were two shutdowns at that time, one of five days, from November 13 through November 19, 1995, and one of 21 days, from December 15, 1995 through January 5, 1996. The first shutdown was not long enough to affect pay checks, and DOD was not affected by the second because defense appropriations were enacted on December 1, so funding was available. So it’s not The One’s fault that the military isn’t getting paid. (Well, it is insofar as he and Reid refuse to agree to Boehner’s new resolution, but it’s not solely his fault.) It’s actually … Reid’s and Pelosi’s fault for not passing a 2011 budget last year when they had a chance. The record stands corrected! "
"With 8.8 percent unemployment across the country and more than 8 million people claiming unemployment benefits, one California congresswoman wants people to know they’re not the only ones facing financial hardship. Who else might be? The lawmaker herself. In an appearance on MSNBC Thursday, Democratic California Rep. Linda Sánchez talked about the downsides of a federal government shutdown. Some lawmakers, to the seriousness of the issue, have said they would forgo their paychecks in the event of that shutdown. Sanchez explained she just can’t afford to go along with that idea. “I have to tell you that I live paycheck-to-paycheck, like most Americans,” Sánchez said. “I’m still paying off my student loans. I have a 2-year-old son who I have to support, and I have to maintain residences on both coasts. It’s very difficult for me to say, ‘Hey, I can give up my paycheck,’ because the reality is, I have financial obligations that I have to meet on a month-to-month basis that doesn’t make it possible for me.” Members of Congress receive an annual salary of $174,000, whereas the median household income for American is a little over $46,000 annually. Nonetheless, Sánchez said it is really tough for her to stretch her paycheck that covers everything. “Now, if you’re a member of Congress who is a millionaire, and there are quite a few members of the House and Senate that are, it’s really not a problem for them,” Sánchez said. “But they don’t share the experience that most Americans share, that I know, having grown up in a family of seven kids to immigrant parents that you have to really stretch a paycheck to make sure that it covers everything. And, you know, this suggestion that it’s so easy for every single lawmaker to do that, that’s just simply not the case for a lot of us.” Watch: The Daily Caller | 1775 Eye Street NW | Suite 1150-290 | Washington, DC 20006"
"Submit Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. ( ) No wonder he’s become such good pals with Al Sharpton. President Obama’s approval ratings among black voters plummeted last month to their lowest levels ever, while his support among Hispanics took a tumble in the same period, according to a surprising new poll released yesterday. Blacks continue to back him by a wide margin, with 85 percent of respondents saying they approved of him in the latest Gallup poll. But that number dropped a hefty 5 percentage points from last month, marking the lowest rating among that core constituency that he’s had since taking office. He also dropped 5 points among Hispanics, sliding from 59 percent to 54, according to the poll. That number ties his July and August 2010 lows. The one-two punch among two groups that helped usher him into the White House comes just after he announced the kickoff of his 2012 election campaign. It also seems to confirm chatter that the commander-in-chief’s sudden affinity for Al Sharpton is an attempt to shore up his African-American base. Obama — in the midst of grueling budget talks — flew up from DC for the 20th anniversary of Sharpton’s National Action Network on Wednesday. At the event, which was studded with African-American luminaries like Bill Cosby, Stevie Wonder and Martin Luther King III, Obama said much hard work still needs to be done on civil rights. “We are going to keep fighting until every family gets a shot at the American dream,” Obama said. A day after Obama’s visit, most attendees at the four-day conference said it was wise for the president to come. “What could be a better place to shore up his support?” said Paul Thompson, a Brooklyn real-estate broker. He blamed Obama’s sliding poll numbers on mudslinging. “You have some groups that say controversial things about him and that affected people in the minority groups,” said Thompson. Meanwhile, Fernando Mateo, president of Hispanics Across America, said that Obama seems to have forgotten about Latinos since being elected. “Until they make Hispanics a priority in the White House or in DC, they [Obama’s poll numbers] will continue to drop,” said Mateo. “The immigration issue is a big one. He had the opportunity to create and make changes when he had the House and the Senate, and he did not,” he said. Obama will make a second New York trip later this month. He’ll be here on April 27 for a network of fund-raisers. A high-roller event will be held at the Manhattan apartment of Jon Corzine, the former New Jersey governor and Goldman Sachs executive. And a larger fund-raiser is scheduled at a major Midtown Manhattan hotel, a campaign source said. Tickets go for $2,500 per person.

"© 1998-2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All Rights Reserved The nation's largest federal employee union sued the Obama administration Friday, seeking the repayment of wages lost during a government shutdown. The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) says in its lawsuit that the administration has violated the Constitution's appropriations clause and the 13th Amendment by requiring employees to work without pay during a federal closure. “Hundreds of thousands of federal employees will be required to work during a shutdown, and there’s no guarantee that Congress will keep the administration’s promise to pay those employees once the shutdown is over,” said John Gage, AFGE's general president, in a statement. “The Constitution requires an appropriation by Congress before federal dollars can be spent, no exceptions. ... Without an appropriation, the agencies simply can't spend money or incur debts by forcing employees to work.” AFGE has 600,000 members who are federal and D.C. government workers. The 13th Amendment became law in 1865, ending the practice of slavery and indentured servitude in the United States. The lawsuit says the administration cannot claim an emergency exception for employees to work during a shutdown since Congress cannot pay for debts when no appropriations have been passed to fund them. The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia and names Office of Management and Budget Director Jacob Lew and Office of Personnel Management Director John Berry as defendants. Other federal worker unions, such as the National Treasury Employees Union, have pushed for legislation that will approve back-pay for workers furloughed during a government shutdown.

"Frank James Wisconsin used to be such a predictably stolid Midwestern state. Now it may as well be Florida. When I previously wrote, on Wednesday, about the Wisconsin Supreme Court race, JoAnne Kloppenberg, the Democratic challenger to Justice David Prosser, a Republican, had declared victory in the nationally watched race after gaining a lead of 204 votes. But she was apparently premature because she was actually behind by more than 7,000 votes in the race in which drew more than 1.5 million voters state-wide. The contest came to be seen as a referendum on the controversial Republican Gov. Scott Walker and his effort to reduce the power of public-employee unions in the state. The city of Brookfield in Waukesha County apparently sent in its results to the county clerk who logged them in her system but forgot to save the data. Thus, when the county's results were provided to the media, they didn't include the Brookfield votes. The county official later discovered the mistake and added back the missing votes. This turn of events, improbable and shocking as they are, will likely make many Democrats suspect electoral chicanery, especially since the county official, Kathy Nickolaus, is a Republican and the missing votes were from a strongly Republican area. But Democrats on hand to review the situation appear satisfied that the added votes are valid. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, which has a story full of details on the day's happenings, reported: At the news conference with Nickolaus, Ramona Kitzinger, the Democrat on the Waukesha County Board of Canvassers, said: ""We went over everything and made sure all the numbers jibed up and they did. Those numbers jibed up and we're satisfied they're correct."" As a Democrat, she said, ""I'm not going to stand here and tell you something that's not true."" A recount is still expected and, the way things are going in Wisconsin, who knows what could happen next? But a lead of more than 7,000 votes would appear a difficult one to overcome.  thanks our sponsors Become an  sponsor"
"Advertisement Supported by By Paul Krugman What have they done with President Obama? What happened to the inspirational figure his supporters thought they elected? Who is this bland, timid guy who doesn’t seem to stand for anything in particular? I realize that with hostile Republicans controlling the House, there’s not much Mr. Obama can get done in the way of concrete policy. Arguably, all he has left is the bully pulpit. But he isn’t even using that — or, rather, he’s using it to reinforce his enemies’ narrative. His remarks after last week’s budget deal were a case in point. Maybe that terrible deal, in which Republicans ended up getting more than their opening bid, was the best he could achieve — although it looks from here as if the president’s idea of how to bargain is to start by negotiating with himself, making pre-emptive concessions, then pursue a second round of negotiation with the G.O.P., leading to further concessions. And bear in mind that this was just the first of several chances for Republicans to hold the budget hostage and threaten a government shutdown; by caving in so completely on the first round, Mr. Obama set a baseline for even bigger concessions over the next few months. But let’s give the president the benefit of the doubt, and suppose that $38 billion in spending cuts — and a much larger cut relative to his own budget proposals — was the best deal available. Even so, did Mr. Obama have to celebrate his defeat? Did he have to praise Congress for enacting “the largest annual spending cut in our history,” as if shortsighted budget cuts in the face of high unemployment — cuts that will slow growth and increase unemployment — are actually a good idea? Among other things, the latest budget deal more than wipes out any positive economic effects of the big prize Mr. Obama supposedly won from last December’s deal, a temporary extension of his 2009 tax cuts for working Americans. And the price of that deal, let’s remember, was a two-year extension of the Bush tax cuts, at an immediate cost of $363 billion, and a potential cost that’s much larger — because it’s now looking increasingly likely that those irresponsible tax cuts will be made permanent. More broadly, Mr. Obama is conspicuously failing to mount any kind of challenge to the philosophy now dominating Washington discussion — a philosophy that says the poor must accept big cuts in Medicaid and food stamps; the middle class must accept big cuts in Medicare (actually a dismantling of the whole program); and corporations and the rich must accept big cuts in the taxes they have to pay. Shared sacrifice! I’m not exaggerating. The House budget proposal that was unveiled last week — and was praised as “bold” and “serious” by all of Washington’s Very Serious People — includes savage cuts in Medicaid and other programs that help the neediest, which would among other things deprive 34 million Americans of health insurance. It includes a plan to privatize and defund Medicare that would leave many if not most seniors unable to afford health care. And it includes a plan to sharply cut taxes on corporations and to bring the tax rate on high earners down to its lowest level since 1931. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center puts the revenue loss from these tax cuts at $2.9 trillion over the next decade. House Republicans claim that the tax cuts can be made “revenue neutral” by “broadening the tax base” — that is, by closing loopholes and ending exemptions. But you’d need to close a lot of loopholes to close a $3 trillion gap; for example, even completely eliminating one of the biggest exemptions, the mortgage interest deduction, wouldn’t come close. And G.O.P. leaders have not, of course, called for anything that drastic. I haven’t seen them name any significant exemptions they would end. You might have expected the president’s team not just to reject this proposal, but to see it as a big fat political target. But while the G.O.P. proposal has drawn fire from a number of Democrats — including a harsh condemnation from Senator Max Baucus, a centrist who has often worked with Republicans — the White House response was a statement from the press secretary expressing mild disapproval. What’s going on here? Despite the ferocious opposition he has faced since the day he took office, Mr. Obama is clearly still clinging to his vision of himself as a figure who can transcend America’s partisan differences. And his political strategists seem to believe that he can win re-election by positioning himself as being conciliatory and reasonable, by always being willing to compromise. But if you ask me, I’d say that the nation wants — and more important, the nation needs — a president who believes in something, and is willing to take a stand. And that’s not what we’re seeing.

"Link copied. We want to bridge divides to reach everyone. Mitt Romney announces he's forming an exploratory committee – a step toward entering the presidential race. He's already signaled several changes from his failed 2008 bid. Loading... April 11, 2011 Mitt Romney made it semi-official Monday: He has formed his presidential exploratory committee, a way-station on the path to a full-fledged presidential campaign. By forming an exploratory committee, the Republican former governor of Massachusetts can now start raising money for his all-but-certain presidential campaign. Mr. Romney is the second major contender to take that step, after former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, and the first repeat customer. In 2008, he lost the Republican nomination to Sen. John McCain of Arizona. In his announcement video posted on MittRomney.com Monday afternoon, Romney emphasized his business background as a jobs creator. “President Obama's policies have failed,” Romney said. “He and virtually all the people around him have never worked in the real economy. They just don't know how jobs are created in the private sector. That's where I spent my entire career.” Romney’s sole focus on the economy in his video provides a likely clue as to how he’ll run for president this time around. In 2008, he tried to reinvent himself as a down-the-line conservative, both fiscal and social. But as governor of Massachusetts, he had campaigned and led as a moderate. His signal achievement was his reform of the state’s health-care system, which included an individual mandate to purchase insurance, the model for Mr. Obama’s reform – and now a big liability among Republicans. Romney’s Mormon faith also remains a sticking point with some Evangelical voters, who form an important part of the Republican base. This time around, Romney has signaled that he will not campaign hard in Iowa and South Carolina, two early nominating states with large Evangelical populations, and instead will focus on two other early states, New Hampshire and Nevada – New Hampshire, because it neighbors Massachusetts, and Nevada, because of its large Mormon population. It is no coincidence that Romney taped his announcement video in New Hampshire – and that he dressed casually, without a tie. The rap on Romney last time was that he appeared stiff, and had a hard time connecting with voters. In general, there has been widespread Republican chagrin at the GOP presidential field this time, such as it is. And the fact that the race is starting late, compared with four years ago, has fueled the perception that it’s a weak field, even one that lacks confidence. Last time, Romney announced his candidacy on Feb. 13, 2007. Now he seems to be tiptoeing in. The dynamic, though, is completely different. Four years ago, the race was wide open for both parties, as President George W. Bush’s second term wound down, and Vice President Dick Cheney also looked forward to retirement. Now Obama is running for reelection, and at this stage, he’s considered the favorite. But if the economic recovery falters, someone with Romney’s portfolio could be just what voters want. The question is whether he can make it through the nomination gauntlet, with an energetic tea party movement looking for the best conservative alternative to support. Already a subscriber?

"[Guest post by Aaron Worthing; if you have tips, please send them here. Or by Twitter @AaronWorthing.] So today we learned of a small victory in the ongoing war over freedom of speech. Sion Owens of the British National Party apparently burned a Koran on video. He was arrested over the weekend or violating Section 29 of the Public Order Act, most likely on the claim that he incited religious hatred as that is apparently part of what the act defines as a crime. Let’s stipulate from the outset that the man himself is probably a tool. The word “national” in the British National Party probably refers to an ethnic or racial identity and thus the man is almost certainly a bigot. But that is beside the point. He has a God-given right to be a bigot, to say his bigoted things, and his freedom to engage in expressive conduct can only be limited in viewpoint-neutral ways. And bluntly, when they arrest him for this kind of thing, all they succeed in doing is giving him a megaphone as we in the west decry the jackboots of the state coming down on his neck. The positive development in this case, however, is that the man has been let go. And that is good. But there is a concern that this was only because of the slightest technicality, and he might be rearrested any day now: He was warned today that police are continuing to investigate the alleged incident and to expect further action. It is understood that his release was due to a technicality regarding the Act under which he was arrested and charged. An unconfirmed source in court today claimed that the permission of the Attorney General must be sought before such a charge can be made. In the case of Mr. Owens, it was not. So this might end up looking like the Geert Wilders case where he was prosecuted against the will of the prosecutors, had his case ended prematurely due to serious misconduct by one of the judges, only to learn that the prosecutors who didn’t want to prosecute him in the first place and said that he shouldn’t be convicted, were being ordered to prosecute him again. (Note: the fact that this was occurring in an inquisitorial judicial system is highly relevant to these shenanigans.) Meanwhile over in America, specifically in St. Paul, you learn the story of a first generation immigrant from Vietnam, who was imprisoned in his home country for his Catholic beliefs, woke one morning to find that someone set a fire at base of his statue of Jesus. Naturally this led to Christians rioting everywhere, killing the women and raping the horses* and so on, right? Oh, wait, nothing like that happened. But of course we know that certain other cultures are a tad more savage and barbarian. Today we learn that the Palestinians feel that they are ready to be their own state: The Palestinians are ready for statehood now, according to a report to be presented to major aid donor countries in Brussels this week by Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Salam Fayyad. The report, “Building Palestine. Achievements and Challenges” will be presented on April 13 to the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee (AHLC), a 12-member committee of the European Union and United States which serves as the principal policy-level coordination mechanism for development assistance to the Palestinians. He will present facts and figures to show how his Palestinian Authority has used hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign assistance over the past two years to create health, education, energy, water, security, justice and housing services. “I believe that our governing institutions have now reached a high state of readiness to assume all the responsibilities that will come with full sovereignty on the entire Palestinian occupied territory,” Fayyad says in the 63-page document. Mmm, yeah, there is more to being ready for statehood than running water and electricity. Let’s present a fact to the contrary: Israeli aircraft and tanks pounded Gaza on Friday, killing seven Hamas militants and five civilians in a surge of fighting sparked by a Palestinian rocket attack on an Israeli school bus the day before. Israel and Gaza’s Hamas rulers seemed on the brink of another round of intense violence, just a little over two years after a three-week war in which persistent rocket fire from Gaza triggered a devastating Israeli military offensive in the territory. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the attack on the school bus “crossed a line” and warned that “whoever tries to harm and murder children will pay with their life.” In Thursday’s attack, Gaza militants hit a yellow Israeli school bus near the border with a guided anti-tank missile, injuring the driver and badly wounding a 16-year-old boy. Most of the schoolchildren on the bus had gotten off shortly before the attack. Hamas, which had largely held its fire since Israel’s last major offensive, claimed responsibility. You catch that bit about the missile? It was guided, which means that someone had to intentionally target that school bus. It is really a matter of luck (or perhaps God’s blessing) that this didn’t result in a pile of dead Jewish children. “Ah, but you are being horribly unfair, Aaron,” you might say, “you can’t hold the entire Palestinian people responsible the actions of a few. It’s not like they have widespread support or anything like that.” But of course that depends on what you mean by “widespread.” It turns out that 32% of Palestinians support the attack murder of the Fogel family last month. I will remind you that this attack resulted in the murder of almost everyone in that family, including three-month old Hadas. This is how she looked in life: And this is her lifeless body being removed: It is no exaggeration to say, as Roger Simon did, that this meant 32% of Palestinians supported infanticide. By comparison here is Haim Levin, an Israeli paramedic who saved a young Palestinian baby’s life and was honored by having her named Jude: The contrast is sharp and to the disadvantage of the Palestinians. One culture saves the lives of children. The other teaches its children to become martyrs: And yeah, 32% of the Palestinian population is not a majority. But do you think you could get 32% of Americans to support the intentional murder of any three month baby? (Well, maybe baby Hitler…) Joking aside, there is no more greater hate than that which drives you to murder a baby. As I said a way back: There is no reason to intentionally murder a baby, unless you believe that there is something about that child that makes him inherently evil. They don’t kill Jews because of anything they have done to them. They kill them out of irrational hate—simply because they are Jews. So, yeah, excuse me if I think they are too much a bunch of barbarians in Palestine to be entrusted with a state. Get your infanticide support down to the single digits and maybe then we will talk. Of course I am sure Glenn Greenwald will call me a bigot or something because of this. Because apparently all countries and cultures are created precisely equal. Now, I do believe that all persons are created equal. But once they are ejected from the womb, inequalities are taken on pretty quickly. This idea that no country, religion or culture could go bad flies against the most obvious lessons of history: No one would say that it is racist to call the Germany in the 1930s and 40s, China under Mao, or Rwanda during its genocide a barbaric country. It’s simply stating a fact. Greenwald may want to stick his head in the sand and impose a false equality on countries and cultures, but I am not obligated to do so. And we in the west are allowed to encourage assimilation away from those barbaric values as people come to our countries. But of course that clashes in difficult ways with concepts such as freedom of expression. So, for instance, in France they have instituted a “burqa ban” that went into effect today: There are also misleading reports suggesting that women in veils were being arrested for wearing veils, but in fact they were arrested for illegal assembly. Yes, those reports mention that the arrest is not for wearing a veil, but you wouldn’t know it to read the headline. To shift gears a little bit, let me tell you about a story I meant to blog about last Halloween, but it got lost in the shuffle. On that Halloween night, a man was arrested for wearing a mask: The News & Observer of Raleigh reports that 20-year-old Lawrence Marqueal Rogers was arrested Sunday for wearing a mask or hood in public. He’s being held in the Wake County jail on a $7,500 bond. Police said Rogers has been convicted in the past of larceny and other charges. Police said he was cited for wearing a red bandanna covering his face except the eyes on Halloween night. After he donned the garment a second time, he was arrested. Now admittedly the Maryland version of this story is funnier, but I wanted to highlight the North Carolina version of that story because that word “hood” should give you a giant clue about the law they were using in that case. It’s a series of laws generically referred to as the Klan Acts. You can see the outline of these laws here under Article 4A. The specific statute he appears to be charged with is NC G.S. § 14-12.7 which says that No person or persons at least 16 years of age shall, while wearing any mask, hood or device whereby the person, face or voice is disguised so as to conceal the identity of the wearer, enter, be or appear upon any lane, walkway, alley, street, road, highway or other public way in this State. Now there is an exception for people “wearing traditional holiday costumes in season” (§ 14-12.11) which seems to be designed for trick-or-treaters. It will be interesting to see if Mr. Rogers can assert that he was actually wearing a Halloween costume. But while § 14-12.11 has numerous exceptions one in particular is missing: religious exceptions. So… are there just no face-covering Muslim women in North Carolina? I strongly doubt that. And yet while this law and laws in many other states like it can only be read as a burqa ban, I have never heard of any face-covering Muslim woman ever being arrested under these kinds of statutes. A google search only reveals this story in Jet Magazine over ten years old based on an alleged misinterpretation of the law. Should this law be enforced strictly as to even apply to Muslim women who are not part of any terrorist organization like the KKK and intend to do nothing worse than go about their daily lives? Well, it depends on what we want these laws to accomplish. It might be the case that such Klan Acts are really used only sparingly, in an application of what I call “The Al Capone Theory of Law Enforcement.” The theory goes like this. Al Capone was a big gangster. Everyone knew he was a big gangster. But we didn’t bust him for being a gangster. We busted him for tax evasion. So the idea is you take people you know to be bad already and bust them on piddly crap in order to get them off the streets. Now this is at best a very dubious theory of law enforcement, but it’s been done and maybe that is what is happening here. Maybe the cops never arrest anyone for wearing a mask in public unless they are pretty sure they are otherwise up to no good. And if that is the approach, then it seems reasonable to say that otherwise law-abiding Muslim women should be exempted—or at least it’s no worse to exempt them than anyone else. But there is another view, which is that there is a danger in having large numbers of people in our society being essentially anonymous and unidentifiable. If a group of Klansmen ride up to your house, what chance do you have of identifying them? Even if they are fool enough to use cars with uncovered license plates, you can’t prove who was in the car and who was driving, and so on. And if a woman in a burqa shoplifts from a store, what chance does anyone have of catching her? So one might argue that a person’s face should be uncovered for the same reason why we require every car to have a license plate: so you can’t just commit a crime and have no chance of being identified. And under that theory, every person wearing a face covering must be arrested, even if it’s a little old lady who only wears that sort of thing because she believes her God wants her to. This bears some legal resemblance to a Florida case a few years back Freeman v. Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, where a Muslim woman demanded that she be allowed to use a veiled picture for her driver’s license. One only has to imagine the silliness of a photo ID that only shows the eyes to see this kind of defeated the whole purpose of the picture. ""Bob? Is that you?"" Now in that case, the state allowed the woman to have the picture taken in a closed room, with only a female photographer present, and she would not be required to show the license to anyone but a cop. In short, the revealing of her face was very slight, but the plaintiff said even that was too much. Here, I am contemplating whether just by virtue of being in public, people should be forced to show their faces. And of course one other thing has to be considered from a policy, rather than legal, angle. If we enforce laws that require Muslim women to remove their veils in public, they might just stop going out in public. If we enforce laws that require them to show their faces to get a driver’s license, they might just stop driving. If we want these Muslim women to achieve equality, the first step might be a reasonable accommodation with these traditions—as backwards as they are. But on the other hand, it is reported that in many European cities that veils are so common that when westernized women come in they are harassed to the point that many women will wear veils that ordinarily wouldn’t. Indeed, I had a friend who visited Morocco and told me of men who just assumed every western woman was a slut or prostitute. She told me that the land was beautiful, but hearing men shout “pussy!” as she walked down the streets almost negated that. In that sense a regime of requiring women to remove their face coverings might stop that sort of thing from happening here. It might be a case of the freedom of those Muslim women being pitted against the freedom of the liberated women. Myself, I tend to think that we should not allow people to appear in public with their faces covered, period (with only a few exceptions for stage performances, Halloween and the like). Of course you might reasonably ask if I would support it as a form of expression and under the principles religious freedom. Certainly a person has an absolute right to believe that a woman should wear a veil and to advocate for laws allowing for it to occur. And certainly there is an expressive element to wearing a veil, as there is an expressive element to burning a Koran. But it simply can’t be the case that every time someone’s conduct is expressive, or based in faith, that we let people do it in contravention of neutrally written laws. I mean by that logic it would be illegal to stop the 9-11 hijackers, because they were just acting according to the dictates of their faith! I would question how a religious exemption would work in practicality. The KKK could then claim that they were motivated by faith in wearing a hood, and indeed they might be. As Clarence Thomas noted in a concurrence, there are many elements of faith in Klan traditions. Its idiotic religious hokem, to be sure, but the law can’t distinguish between “dumb” faiths and “smart” ones. And indeed, the first time I heard of Terry Jones and his plan to burn Korans was when his city denied him a permit to do so. And I felt that this was kosher as long as the ordinance was enforced without regard to what was being burned. Of course given that this was allegedly occurring in Gainesville, Florida, home of the University of Flordia Gators and the Gator Growl, it seems very likely that they do allow bonfires for expressive purposes—just not Jones’ expressive purpose and that was the problem for me. When expressive conduct is involved I don’t mind regulation of conduct, as long as it is neutral among the viewpoints expressed in that conduct. So a burqa ban because people should never be anonymous in public or perhaps to protect the freedom of all women to go burqa-free? I can support that. But a ban because its “unFrench” to behave that way seems much more questionable. Yes, yes, I support assimilation, but mostly by persuasion rather than force. ————————– * With apologies to everyone involved in Blazing Saddles. [Posted and authored by Aaron Worthing.] Pamela Geller has some good info on the BNP. Perhaps it’s just the rebel in me, but I think there’s a benefit to having a policy that pisses off assholes. Sticking a finger in the eye of radical Islam is a benefit–though perhaps not one great enough to overcome also sticking your finger in the eye of non-radical Islam. That said, Ryu Hayabusa kicks ass. The BNP are indeed racist [censored], but Aaron’s point is valid. Restricting their freedom of speech is counter-productive, with sunlight being the best disinfectant and all. It’s one of the weird outcomes of WWII – the speech codes and anti-Holocaust-denial laws – that really shows the contrast between here and Europe. Aaron – respectfully, using “Russia Today” as a news source is not credible. Sure, this report was accurate, but they give equal credence to lots of wild conspiracies. It’s like the Alex Jones show. [censored slightly by me for language to let the comment out of the penalty box. –Aaron] IIRC, NY’s anti-mask law was struck down about 5-10 years ago, when the police tried to use it to shut down a KKK rally. Clive you get serious geek points for knowing who the ninja was. whether that is a good or bad thing, I will leave to your own determination. You know who else kicks even more ass than Ryu Hayabusa,Christie the assassin from Dead Or Alive 3. I’m being repressed moderated I think. carlitoes yeah, don’t curse and that won’t happen. or hide it. i released it with a [censored] instead of the word. sorry. Doh mmm, give me a kratos any day of the week and i am happy. Kratos is badass. Yes, yes, I support assimilation, but mostly by persuasion rather than force. This is the core of the issue, I think. How do we promote assimilation without losing our sense of individual liberty (one of the critical aspects that makes Western culture superior to Islam)? I think making it as easy as possible for people to interact should be a core element. For example, we should try to restrict immigration and extended visas to anyone who can’t pass an English proficiency exam. That’s hardly a direct attack on Islam, but I think that should help. A great Western Civ education should also help quite a bit. I have a specific problem with the idea of ‘you cannot wear a mask’ laws. by all means, have that rule cover private property (if you own it), but there’s a time and a place to have an anonymous protest. I recall here in Austin, when a bunch of people protested the Scientologists for their thuggishness towards protestors. By being anonymous and numerous, it was impossible to thwart. We have to think longer term than that. The only way to kick more ass than Ryu Hayabusa is to have feet made out of Ryu Hayabusas. Yes, yes, I support assimilation, but mostly by persuasion rather than force. I think to believe that assimilation can be accomplished through persuasion requires an open mindedness. What evidence of that do you see? I think the burqa ban in France is more about the French government *finally* facing facts and admitting they have an enormous problem facing them with an increasing Muslim population inside their borders. The biggest problem in this of course, is the number of extremists populating France and the number of homegrown ones coming up the ranks. The greater number of extremists, the more brazen and emboldened they are. There are also other negative impacts that they face: their economy has been directly hit by a high percentage of Muslim immigrants dependent on welfare, coupled with an extremely high rate of unemployment within that community. And of course, their lack of assimilation only exacerbates the problems. In light of all of this, perhaps the government thought to push back at what seems to be the easiest and quickest to deal with and also offends French sensibilities most of all: the burqa – symbolizing severe oppression and subjugation. While some argue that a woman should have the choice to hide her face and body if that is what she feels reflects a pious Muslim woman, the flip side of that could (and should) also be argued: some Muslim women are forced to hide their face and body in order to hide the evidence of being beaten, battered, and bloodied by an angry husband – who is permitted by his religion to leave the black and blue marks. some Muslim women are forced to hide their face and body in order to hide the evidence of being beaten, battered, and bloodied by an angry husband – who is permitted by his religion to leave the black and blue marks. An astute point. Of course, these same women will simply be locked indoors instead of showing evidence of a husband’s brutality. And women have been figuring out how to obscure facial bruises with makeup for generations. It would be nice of PETA would stage their racy ‘I’m a posing in a slutty way, therefore do not eat meat or wear leather’ protests in Islamic enclaves. Intolerance of women showing their faces is the perfect thing for lefties to protest. Another effect this banning might have, and frankly, be intended, is to discourage continuing immigration from particular countries to France. They have become one gigantic and unsustainable welfare state and are going under quickly. To tackle their entire budget, impose austerity measures, etc., is a growing fight that they will be forced to fully undertake soon but in the meantime, start on an everyman woman level and work your way up… Perhaps this is the beginning of a squeeze. France has to gain control some how, some way. > It would be nice of PETA Throughout history there are humans who have longed to be treated as gently as our livestock. PETA from start to finish is about misplaced priorities. give me a kratos any day of the week and i am happy. Well, you know, if that’s how you swing, dude… NTTIAWWT ________________________________________ He was warned today that police are continuing to investigate the alleged incident and to expect further action. But what if he were an Islamicist, recent immigrant or otherwise, shown burning a Bible? Even more so since Europe, including Britain, is further to the left — certainly socio-culturally speaking — than we are, I bet such an incident would’ve been dealt with in a way similar to how Nidal Malik Hasan was handled. I’m referring to the guy who shot up Fort Hood in 2009, and whose fanatic pro-Islam rantings were treated with kid gloves — by the US military establishment, no less! — right up to the moment of his bloody rampage. IOW, no one dared raise an eyebrow or lift a finger until the behavior of fanaticism had gone way past merely the filming of books being burned. Political correctness run amok allows the Western World, including the US, to play the role of the ultimate fool and sucker. The ultimate in “useful idiots.” Ya know these fricktards will get us all killed. I want to throw an idea out here; An awful lot of the 19th century was driven by sloppy understanding of Darwin’s Theory of Evolution. Darwin specifically DID NOT say that natural law forced evolution from the simple and flawed toward the complex and perfect, but a great many people interpreted the theory that way. This gave rise to Social Darwinism, and Marxism, and a lot of other isms that did a lot of mischief. Multiculturalism sounds to me like it probably started as a mental trick of archeologists to keep from imposing the filter of their own culture on data they were uncovering on past cultures. Say that it escaped into broader academia via the cocktail circuit, and was broadly applied to matters beyond its proper scope. There could be a lot of reasons for this, among them the fact that any frank comparison of social structures was going to play hell with the Radical Chic pastimes that depended on Communist cultures being respectable. Unless it is confined to scholarly analysis Multiculturalism simply makes no sense whatsoever. What do you-all think? Is there a parallel? Do you suppose the same principle could be applied to SWAT teams? They have, on occasion, the motive, opportunity, and equipment to do more damage to innocent parties than the average Abu Nosehair. CSP possibly. And we have been too quick to judge the approaches of other cultures as valueless in the past. The other thing is I think we need to differentiate between great cultural issues and small ones. Like democracy v. dictatorship, free speech, etc. these are great cultural issues. and we shouldn’t be very open minded about them. i am not saying that there is no room to tinker with those issues, but the default is, yes, america is superior in those respects. by contrast in most cases what you have for dinner, what clothes you wear is a matter of small culture, and we shouldn’t feel too strongly about it and we should be extremely open to new ideas on the subject. That was a pretty childish choice of fake name. Mr. Worthing; Exactly! When one culture is debating whether Homosexuals should be allowed to marry and another is debating whether they should be burned alive or defenestrated, I know which is better. When one culture fights an ongoing battle with racism and is ashamed, and another continues as much of the custom of chattel slavery as it thinks it can get away with, I know which is superior. My father taught History of Science and Technology for forty years. Central to his teaching was the idea that in every era of a culture there is a dominant style, and that style influences EVERYTHING. If you have baroque painting and baroque music, then you will have baroque politics and baroque science. I grew up with this idea. I rapidly became clear to me that one of the implications was that emerging science would have as much effect on the style of a society as emerging art. Then, as I look at that notion further, it struck me that it was important to make a distinction between what the people who WORKED in a field thought about an idea that was influencing society at large, and what society at large thought about it. Case in point; Darwin. Darwin was not saying “There is no God”. Darwin was not saying “Natural Law dictates that the strong overcome the weak, and this is Moral”. Darwin was not saying “Evolution is a force that applies to change outside of biology, and that force is directional”. Those were common misunderstandings of Darwin that affected society just as strongly as if they were central to his thesis. it helps to expose the balderdash of Marx to know that his “theory’ of social evolution is a transparent attempt to hijack something Marx misunderstood about Darwin, to make his fever dream sound ‘scientific’. Similarly, I hope that it will help expose the nitwittery of multiculturalism if we can show where it comes from, and that as formulated it was not supposed to have a lot of application outside a rather narrow field of intellectual endeavor. I’m going to go looking for origins. If I find any I’ll report back. But I have a busy and somewhat fraught life; if anybody reading this KNOWS anything, please let me/us know, eh? You wrote: “And we in the west… as people come to our countries”. Well who is “we” or “our”? And why the plural of “countries”? I can understand saying “our country”, but how do you justify “our countries” without having a clear idea of what “we” means? Yet you condemn the British National Party as being a priori bigots for your reading of the word “National”. I submit that your thinking on these questions is exceedingly muddled and unclear. While some argue that a woman should have the choice to hide her face and body if that is what she feels reflects a pious Muslim woman, the flip side of that could (and should) also be argued: some Muslim women are forced to hide their face and body in order to hide the evidence of being beaten, battered, and bloodied by an angry husband – who is permitted by his religion to leave the black and blue marks IIRC, although the banning of wearing it is getting all the attention over here, the big penalties are for anyone found to have forced a woman to wear one– like, “price of a new car” type big penalty. Seems to me it’s pretty clear that the ban on wearing one is just a way to make it so you can find who is forcing “their” women into the bag. Hm, I must’ve messed up the blockquote somehow. First para is from Dana up top. Scott > Well, you know, if that’s how you swing, dude… Kratos was so offended he has leapt into reality and is googling your home address. Be afraid. Be very afraid. Scott Besides, Kratos clearly loves the ladies.  (funny, mildly nsfw video at link featuring Kratos in a music video) Bah, Kakashi Hatake is a far better masked ninja. Only he NEVER shows more than ONE of his eyes! (Yes, that was an obscure joke…don’t even know if it works in the English dub.) Kratos was also given a tax break that is not right only the gods that don’t pay their taxes deserve a tax break. CSPS–I read something recently online which aligns rather exactly with what you said; the only disparate detail is that multiculturalism began with anthropology. Unfortunately, I made no note of where I read it, so I can’t even begin to point you to a link. And Marx was more in tune with applying Hegel than Darwin.

"There is a quote out there that sometimes get attributed to Republican Senate Leader Everett Dirksen and sometimes not. The quote is that there two parties in Washington — the stupid party and the evil party. Every once in a while the stupid party and the evil party get together and do something that is both stupid and evil. In Washington, that is called bipartisanship. Our United States Senate, led by Republican Senator Saxby Chambliss of Georgia and Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia are on the verge of leading the Congress into doing something both stupid and evil. It will be heralded by the Washington Press Corp as a grownup act of bipartisan. To give you a sense of just how bad it is, even Barack Obama is getting in on the act and signaling he will support what Chambliss and Warner come up with if only as a way to shut down serious conversation about Paul Ryan‘s “Path to Prosperity.” Last year, Barack Obama formed a Deficit Reduction Commission. The Commission’s report came out and Barack Obama promptly treated it like it was an illegitimate child worthy of being shunned. The White House did not mention it. During Obama’s State of the Union address he glossed over and ignored the panel. He punted on every significant issue. Fast forward to last week. Congressman Paul Ryan introduced his “Path to Prosperity.” Even Democrats were calling Paul Ryan “courageous” for his willingness to step out there. The chairmen of the Deficit Commission, Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson, praised Ryan’s leadership. Many people noted Barack Obama’s absence from the debate. So Obama has to do something. The Washington Post reports Obama will come out and give a lot of platitudes without much substance, but he will claim that his platitudinal direction is far better than Paul Ryan’s substantive direction. He will have Saxby Chambliss and Mark Warner to back him up. Already Chambliss and Warner are out subtly criticizing Paul Ryan’s plan. They are downplaying its significance and making it clear that it won’t pass the Senate. What Chambliss, Warner, and four other Senators have in store for us is the stupid and evil solution — raise taxes, restructure entitlements, and do it in such a way that it keeps the citizenry of the republic fueling the leviathan. Saxby Chambliss gave away the game in an interview with the Atlanta Journal. He said, in part, “[Y]ou’ve got to have enough money to run the government, and then you’ve got to have excess money to start paying down on that debt.” What we know of the Chambliss-Warner plan is that while entitlements will be reformed and the tax code simplified, restructuring programs, entitlements, and taxes will involve keeping Washington at the center of all reforms. It is stupid to do this because keeping Washington at the center of all reforms will mean that eventually the leviathan will come looking for future sacrifice again. The appetite will be unabated. It is evil to do this because these reforms are guaranteed to further enslave future generations of Americans to Washington, D.C. In Saxby Chambliss, Mark Warner, and Barack Obama’s world view, Washington, D.C. is the indispensable party. Any conversation about block grants, handing power and money to the states, etc. is unserious and not grownup. They view themselves as the masters of our destiny. They will commit us to a bipartisan compromise that, in ten years, we will be having to fix. They will do so in way that makes the nation poorer. But they’ll win praise from the Washington media and liberal commentariat. Conservatives, this is the next fight. They will tie this to the debt ceiling. We can stop them, but we must act fast. Conservatives should stake their ground on a balanced budget amendment and passage of Paul Ryan’s reforms. The stupid and evil compromise must be stopped. It is, at its core, made of the same flawed conventional beltway wisdom where the smartest guys in the room get together, hammer out a deal, have the media praise it, and get it passed. In other words, it is exactly like every other deal that has gotten us into the fiscal mess we are in right now. "
"(04-09) 04:00 PDT Riverside - -- Gov. Jerry Brown signaled Friday that he may change strategy and push the Legislature to approve tax extensions and increases before voters have a chance to weigh in on the issue. Under this new plan being considered by the Democratic governor, Californians would get to vote on whether to undo any tax hikes or extensions imposed by the Legislature and governor. The governor promised during his campaign and after his election that he would not increase taxes to help solve the state's budget crisis without asking voters for their approval. Brown said Republicans, however, have blocked his attempts to bring the tax question to voters in a special election before the start of the new fiscal year, July 1. Brown rejected the notion that such a plan would violate his promise, which was central in his campaign. ""I'll keep my campaign promise,"" he said. ""You watch, you'll see."" The governor has said a vote could be held as soon as September. If voters decided to rescind any Legislature-approved taxes, then an all-cuts budget would be triggered, Brown said. Brown is working with the Legislature to find a solution to California's remaining $15.4 billion deficit before the start of the fiscal year on July 1. ""Right now, you can't have an election in June. It's too late, OK?"" Brown said to reporters after meeting with county law enforcement officials. ""So either we crash over the cliff or we come up with something else."" The governor will release his updated plan for solving the state's remaining deficit in mid-May. Brown made the comments in Riverside, on the first leg of what he says will be a statewide tour to hear for himself what an all-cuts solution to the state's deficit would mean for California. Earlier, he visited an elementary school that largely serves non-native English speakers in a poorer part of this city where he gave a frank accounting of the state's fiscal hole. ""I'm not here as part of some campaign,"" Brown told the approximately 60 invited education officials from the area who gathered in the school's cafeteria. ""I'm really here to get some information and to give voice to you here in Riverside County, to learn for myself some of the practical implications of what we're facing."" He got a firsthand look at what previous budget cuts from the state's persistent deficits have meant in this city, as he visited a fourth-grade classroom holding 35 students. Last year, the classroom had 22 students, their teacher said, saying she has had to cut back on the time dedicated to studying California's history. Brown said he was surprised that the class was already so large. John Tavaglione, a member of the Riverside County Board of Supervisors and president of the California State Association of Counties, said that without taxes, the county faces between $150 million and $170 million in additional cuts. ""We will not be able to function,"" he said. Law enforcement officials from Riverside and neighboring San Bernardino County raised similar warnings about their ability to conduct current public safety functions if tax revenues diminish. Michelle Scray, the chief probation officer for San Bernardino County who met with Brown, said a reduction in the vehicle license fee - which would happen July 1 without action by the Legislature - would cut her budget by $8 million and mean there would no longer be specialized probation officers specifically monitoring sex offenders. The county would also have to eliminate all its current juvenile probation services, she said. Republicans at the Capitol have accused Democrats of fearmongering on an all-cuts scenario, but Republican law enforcement officers who met with Brown said the consequences of decreased revenue would be dire. Brown wants to maintain a 0.5 percent increase in vehicle license fees and a one-cent increase in the state sales tax that are set to expire in July. A 0.25 percent increase in the personal income tax and a reduced state tax credit for dependents that expired in January would be reinstated, and the higher rates would be in effect for five years. Brown's visit to Arlanza Elementary School was met with some protest, though, as about a dozen people stood across the street holding signs opposing any tax extension. Robert Ledbetter, a Republican from San Bernardino County, wore a Jerry Brown mask while other people led around a small pony and a dog. Ledbetter decried the event as a ""dog and pony show."" But Brown rejected that notion. ""This is damn serious,"" the governor said. ""The fate of schoolchildren and public safety is at risk."" E-mail Wyatt Buchanan at wbuchanan@sfchronicle.com.

"The United States federal budget comprises the spending and revenues of the U.S. federal government. The budget is the financial representation of the priorities of the government, reflecting historical debates and competing economic philosophies. The government primarily spends on healthcare, retirement, and defense programs. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office provides extensive analysis of the budget and its economic effects. It has reported that large budget deficits over the next 30 years are projected to drive federal debt held by the public to unprecedented levels—from 98 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2020 to 195 percent by 2050.[1] The United States has the largest external debt in the world and the 14th largest government debt as % of GDP in the world. The annual budget deficit increased from $585 billion (3.2% GDP) in 2016 to $984 billion (4.7% GDP) in 2019, up 68%.[2][3] Relative to a CBO forecast prior to President Trump's inauguration, the budget deficits for 2019-2021 roughly doubled, due to the Trump tax cuts and other spending legislation.[4] Due to the coronavirus pandemic, Congress and President Trump enacted the $2.2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES) on March 18, 2020, which the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated would be partially responsible for an increase of the budget deficit for fiscal year 2020 to a record $3.8 trillion, or 18.7% GDP.[5] The CBO preliminary estimate for the fiscal year 2020 deficit is $3.1 trillion or 15.2% GDP, the largest since 1945 relative to the size of the economy.[6] The budget document often begins with the President's proposal to Congress recommending funding levels for the next fiscal year, beginning October 1 and ending on September 30 of the year following. The fiscal year refers to the year in which it ends. However, Congress is the body required by law to pass appropriations annually and to submit funding bills passed by both houses to the President for signature. Congressional decisions are governed by rules and legislation regarding the federal budget process. Budget committees set spending limits for the House and Senate committees and for Appropriations subcommittees, which then approve individual appropriations bills to allocate funding to various federal programs.[7] If Congress fails to pass an annual budget, then several appropriations bills must be passed as ""stop gap"" measures. After Congress approves an appropriations bill, it is then sent to the President, who may either sign it into law or veto it. A vetoed bill is sent back to Congress, which can pass it into law with a two-thirds majority in each legislative chamber. Congress may also combine all or some appropriations bills into one omnibus reconciliation bill. In addition, the president may request and the Congress may pass supplemental appropriations bills or emergency supplemental appropriations bills. Several government agencies provide budget data and analysis. These include the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the Treasury Department. These agencies have reported that the federal government is facing many important long-run financing challenges, primarily driven by an aging population, rising interest payments, and spending for healthcare programs like Medicare and Medicaid.[8] President Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law in December 2017. CBO forecasts that the 2017 Tax Act will increase the sum of budget deficits (debt) by $2.289 trillion over the 2018-2027 decade, or $1.891 trillion after macro-economic feedback.[3] This is in addition to the $10.1 trillion increase forecast under the CBO June 2017 current law baseline and existing $20 trillion national debt.[9] During FY2019, the federal government spent $4.45 trillion, up $338 billion or 7.1% vs. FY2018 spending of $4.11 trillion. Spending increased for all major categories and was mainly driven by higher spending for Social Security, net interest on the debt, and defense. Spending as % GDP rose from 20.3% GDP to 21.2% GDP, above the 50-year average.[2] Also during FY2019, the federal government collected approximately $3.46 trillion in tax revenue, up $133 billion or 3.7% versus FY2018. Primary receipt categories included individual income taxes ($1,717B), Payroll taxes ($1,244B), and corporate taxes ($230B).[2] During FY2018, the federal government spent $4.11 trillion, up $127 billion or 3.2% vs. FY2017 spending of $3.99 trillion. Spending increased for all major categories and was mainly driven by higher spending for Social Security, net interest on the debt, and defense. Spending as % GDP fell from 20.7% GDP to 20.3% GDP, equal to the 50-year average.[10] Also during FY2018, the federal government collected approximately $3.33 trillion in tax revenue, up $14 billion or less than 1% versus FY2017. Primary receipt categories included individual income taxes ($1,684B or 51% of total receipts), Social Security/Social Insurance taxes ($1,171B or 35%), and corporate taxes ($205B or 6%). Corporate tax revenues declined by $92 billion or 32% due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. FY 2018 revenues were 16.4% of gross domestic product (GDP), versus 17.2% in FY 2017.[10] Tax revenues averaged approximately 17.4% GDP over the 1980-2017 period.[3] Tax revenues in 2018 were about $275 billion below the CBO January 2017 forecast for 2018, indicating tax revenues would have been considerably higher (and deficits lower) in the absence of the tax cuts.[3] The budget deficit increased from $779 billion in FY2018 to $984 billion FY2019, up $205 billion or 26%. The budget deficit increased from $666 billion in FY2017 to $779 billion in FY2018, an increase of $113 billion or 17.0%.[10] The 2019 deficit was an estimated 4.7% GDP, up from 3.9% GDP in 2018 and 3.5% GDP in 2017. The historical average deficit is 2.9% GDP.[11] During January 2017, just prior to President Trump's inauguration, CBO forecast that FY2019 budget deficit would be $610 billion if laws in place at that time remained in place. The $984 billion actual results represents a $374 billion or 61% increase versus that forecast, driven mainly by tax cuts and additional spending. Similarly, the FY 2018 budget deficit of $779 billion was a $292 billion or 60% increase versus that forecast.[12] The following table summarizes several budgetary statistics for the fiscal year 2015-2019 periods as a percent of GDP, including federal tax revenue, outlays or spending, deficits (revenue – outlays), and debt held by the public. The historical average for 1969-2018 is also shown. With U.S. GDP of about $21 trillion in 2019, 1% of GDP is about $210 billion.[13] The U.S. Constitution (Article I, section 9, clause 7) states that ""No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law; and a regular Statement and Account of Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be published from time to time."" Each year, the President of the United States submits a budget request to Congress for the following fiscal year as required by the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921. Current law (31 U.S.C. § 1105(a)) requires the president to submit a budget no earlier than the first Monday in January, and no later than the first Monday in February. Typically, presidents submit budgets on the first Monday in February. The budget submission has been delayed, however, in some new presidents' first year when the previous president belonged to a different party. The federal budget is calculated largely on a cash basis. That is, revenues and outlays are recognized when transactions are made. Therefore, the full long-term costs of programs such as Medicare, Social Security, and the federal portion of Medicaid are not reflected in the federal budget. By contrast, many businesses and some other national governments have adopted forms of accrual accounting, which recognizes obligations and revenues when they are incurred. The costs of some federal credit and loan programs, according to provisions of the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, are calculated on a net present value basis.[14] Federal agencies cannot spend money unless funds are authorized and appropriated. Typically, separate Congressional committees have jurisdiction over authorization and appropriations. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees currently have 12 subcommittees, which are responsible for drafting the 12 regular appropriations bills that determine amounts of discretionary spending for various federal programs. Appropriations bills must pass both the House and Senate and then be signed by the president in order to give federal agencies the legal budget authority to spend.[15] In many recent years, regular appropriations bills have been combined into ""omnibus"" bills. Congress may also pass ""special"" or ""emergency"" appropriations. Spending that is deemed an ""emergency"" is exempt from certain Congressional budget enforcement rules. Funds for disaster relief have sometimes come from supplemental appropriations, such as after Hurricane Katrina. In other cases, funds included in emergency supplemental appropriations bills support activities not obviously related to actual emergencies, such as parts of the 2000 Census of Population and Housing. Special appropriations have been used to fund most of the costs of war and occupation in Iraq and Afghanistan so far.[citation needed] Budget resolutions and appropriations bills, which reflect spending priorities of Congress, will usually differ from funding levels in the president's budget. The president, however, retains substantial influence over the budget process through veto power and through congressional allies when the president's party has a majority in Congress. The amount of budget authority and outlays for a fiscal year usually differ because the government can incur obligations for future years. This means that budget authority from a previous fiscal year can, in many cases, be used for expenditure of funds in future fiscal years; for example, a multi-year contract. Budget authority is the legal authority provided by federal law to enter into financial obligations that will result in immediate or future outlays involving federal government funds. Outlays refer to the issuance of checks, disbursement of cash or electronic transfer of funds made to liquidate a federal obligation and is usually synonymous with ""expenditure"" or ""spending"". The term ""appropriations"" refers to budget authority to incur obligations and to make payments from the Treasury for specified purposes. Some military and some housing programs have multi-year appropriations, in which their budget authority is specified for several coming fiscal years. In the congressional budgeting process, an ""authorization"" (technically the ""authorization act"") provides the legal authority for the executive branch to act, establishes an account which can receive money to implement the action, and sets a limit on how much money may be expended. However, this account remains empty until Congress approves an ""appropriation"", which requires the U.S. Treasury to provide funds (up to the limit provided for in the authorization). Congress is not required to appropriate as much money as is authorized.[16] Congress may both authorize and appropriate in the same bill. Known as ""authorization bills"", such legislation usually provides for a multi-year authorization and appropriation. Authorization bills are particularly useful when funding entitlement programs (benefits which federal law says an individual has a right to, regardless if any money is appropriated), where estimating the amount of funds to be spent is difficult. Authorization bills are also useful when giving a federal agency the right to borrow money, sign contracts, or provide loan guarantees. In 2007, two-thirds of all federal spending came through authorization bills.[17] A ""backdoor authorization"" occurs when an appropriation is made and an agency required to spend the money even when no authorizing legislation has been enacted. A ""backdoor appropriation"" occurs when authorizing legislation requires an agency to spend a specific amount of money on a specific project within a specific period of time. Because the agency would be violating the law if it did not do so, it is required to spend the money—even if no appropriation has been made. Backdoor appropriations are particularly vexsome because removing the appropriation requires amending federal law, which is often politically impossible to do within a short period of time. Backdoor authorizations and appropriations are sources of significant friction in Congress. Authorization and appropriations committees jealously guard their legislative rights, and the congressional budgeting process can break down when committees overstep their boundaries and are retaliated against.[18] Several government agencies provide budget data. These include the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the U.S. Treasury Department. The CBO publishes The Budget and Economic Outlook in January, which covers a ten-year window and is typically updated in August. It also publishes a Long-Term Budget Outlook in July and a Monthly Budget Review. The OMB, which is responsible for organizing the President's budget presented in February, typically issues a budget update in July. The GAO and the Treasury issue Financial Statements of the U.S. Government, usually in the December following the close of the federal fiscal year, which occurs September 30. There is a corresponding Citizen's Guide, a short summary. The Treasury Department also produces a Combined Statement of Receipts, Outlays, and Balances each December for the preceding fiscal year, which provides detailed data on federal financial activities. Historical tables within the President's Budget (OMB) provide a wide range of data on federal government finances. Many of the data series begin in 1940 and include estimates of the President's Budget for 2018–2023. Additionally, Table 1.1 provides data on receipts, outlays, and surpluses or deficits for 1901–1939 and for earlier multi-year periods. This document is composed of 17 sections, each of which has one or more tables. Each section covers a common theme. Section 1, for example, provides an overview of the budget and off-budget totals; Section 2 provides tables on receipts by source; and Section 3 shows outlays by function. When a section contains several tables, the general rule is to start with tables showing the broadest overview data and then work down to more detailed tables. The purpose of these tables is to present a broad range of historical budgetary data in one convenient reference source and to provide relevant comparisons likely to be most useful. The most common comparisons are in terms of proportions (e.g., each major receipt category as a percentage of total receipts and of the gross domestic product).[20] The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects budget data such as revenues, expenses, deficits, and debt as part of its ""Long-term Budget Outlook"" which is released annually. The 2018 Outlook included projections for debt through 2048 and beyond. CBO outlined several scenarios that result in a range of outcomes. The ""Extended Baseline"" scenario and ""Extended Alternative Fiscal"" scenario both result in a much higher level of debt relative to the size of the economy (GDP) as the country ages and healthcare costs rise faster than the rate of economic growth. CBO also identified scenarios involving significant austerity measures, which maintain or reduce the debt relative to GDP over time. CBO estimated the size of changes that would be needed to achieve a chosen goal for federal debt. For example, if lawmakers wanted to reduce the amount of debt in 2048 to 41 percent of GDP (its average over the past 50 years), they might cut noninterest spending, increase revenues, or take a combination of both approaches to make changes that equaled 3.0 percent of GDP each year starting in 2019. (In dollar terms, that amount would total about $630 billion in 2019.) If, instead, policymakers wanted debt in 2048 to equal its current share of GDP (78 percent), the necessary changes would be smaller (although still substantial), totaling 1.9 percent of GDP per year (or about $400 billion in 2019). The longer lawmakers waited to act, the larger the policy changes would need to be to reach any particular goal for federal debt.[21] During FY2018, the federal government collected approximately $3.33 trillion in tax revenue, up $14 billion or less than 1% versus FY2017. Primary receipt categories included individual income taxes ($1,684B or 51% of total receipts), Social Security/Social Insurance taxes ($1,171B or 35%), and corporate taxes ($205B or 6%). Corporate tax revenues declined by $92 billion or 32% due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Other revenue types included excise, estate and gift taxes. FY 2018 revenues were 16.4% of gross domestic product (GDP), versus 17.2% in FY 2017.[10] Tax revenues averaged approximately 17.4% GDP over the 1980-2017 period.[3] During FY2017, the federal government collected approximately $3.32 trillion in tax revenue, up $48 billion or 1.5% versus FY2016. Primary receipt categories included individual income taxes ($1,587B or 48% of total receipts), Social Security/Social Insurance taxes ($1,162B or 35%), and corporate taxes ($297B or 9%). Other revenue types included excise, estate and gift taxes. FY 2017 revenues were 17.3% of gross domestic product (GDP), versus 17.7% in FY 2016. Tax revenues averaged approximately 17.4% GDP over the 1980-2017 period.[3] Tax revenues are significantly affected by the economy. Recessions typically reduce government tax collections as economic activity slows. For example, tax revenues declined from $2.5 trillion in 2008 to $2.1 trillion in 2009, and remained at that level in 2010. From 2008 to 2009, individual income taxes declined 20%, while corporate taxes declined 50%. At 14.6% of GDP, the 2009 and 2010 collections were the lowest level of the past 50 years.[9] The federal personal income tax is progressive, meaning a higher marginal tax rate is applied to higher ranges of income. For example, in 2010 the tax rate that applied to the first $17,000 in taxable income for a couple filing jointly was 10%, while the rate applied to income over $379,150 was 35%. The top marginal tax rate has declined considerably since 1980. For example, the top tax rate was lowered from 70% to 50% in 1980 and reached as low as 28% in 1988. The Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003, extended by President Obama in 2010, lowered the top rate from 39.6% to 35%.[23] The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 raised the income tax rates for individuals earning over $400,000 and couples over $450,000. There are numerous exemptions and deductions, that typically result in a range of 35–40% of U.S. households owing no federal income tax. The recession and tax cut stimulus measures increased this to 51% for 2009, versus 38% in 2007.[24] In 2011 it was found that 46% of households paid no federal income tax, however the top 1% contributed about 25% of total taxes collected.[25] In 2014, the top 1% paid approximately 46% of the federal income taxes, excluding payroll taxes.[26] The federal payroll tax (FICA) partially funds Social Security and Medicare. For the Social Security portion, employers and employees each pay 6.2% of the workers gross pay, a total of 12.4%. The Social Security portion is capped at $118,500 for 2015, meaning income above this amount is not subject to the tax. It is a flat tax up to the cap, but regressive overall as it is not applied to higher incomes. The Medicare portion is also paid by employer and employee each at 1.45% and is not capped. Starting in 2013, an additional 0.9 percent more in Medicare taxes was applied to income of more than $200,000 ($250,000 for married couples filing jointly), making it a progressive tax overall. For calendar years 2011 and 2012, the employee's portion of the payroll tax was reduced to 4.2% as an economic stimulus measure; this expired for 2013.[27] Approximately 65% percent of tax return filers pay more in payroll taxes than income taxes.[28] The term ""tax expenditures"" refers to income exclusions, deductions, preferential rates, and credits that reduce revenues for any given level of tax rates in the individual, payroll, and corporate income tax systems. Like conventional spending, they contribute to the federal budget deficit. They also influence choices about working, saving, and investing, and affect the distribution of income. The amount of reduced federal revenues are significant, estimated by CBO at nearly 8% GDP or about $1.5 trillion in 2017, for scale roughly half the revenue collected by the government and nearly three times as large as the budget deficit. Since eliminating a tax expenditure changes economic behavior, the amount of additional revenue that would be generated is somewhat less than the estimated size of the tax expenditure.[9] CBO reported that the following were among the largest individual (non-corporate) tax expenditures in 2013: In 2013, CBO estimated that more than half of the combined benefits of 10 major tax expenditures would apply to households in the top 20% income group, and that 17% of the benefit would go to the top 1% households. The top 20% of income earners pay about 70% of federal income taxes, excluding payroll taxes.[29] For scale, 50% of the $1.5 trillion in tax expenditures in 2016 was $750 billion, while the U.S. budget deficit was approximately $600 billion.[9] In other words, eliminating the tax expenditures for the top 20% might balance the budget over the short-term, depending on economic feedback effects. During FY2018, the federal government spent $4.11 trillion, up $127 billion or 3.2% vs. FY2017 spending of $3.99 trillion. Spending increased for all major categories and was mainly driven by higher spending for Social Security, net interest on the debt, and defense. Spending as % GDP fell from 20.7% GDP to 20.3% GDP, equal to the 50-year average.[10] During FY2017, the federal government spent $3.98 trillion, up $128 billion or 3.3% vs. FY2016 spending of $3.85 trillion. Major categories of FY 2017 spending included: Healthcare such as Medicare and Medicaid ($1,077B or 27% of spending), Social Security ($939B or 24%), non-defense discretionary spending used to run federal Departments and Agencies ($610B or 15%), Defense Department ($590B or 15%), and interest ($263B or 7%).[3] Expenditures are classified as ""mandatory"", with payments required by specific laws to those meeting eligibility criteria (e.g., Social Security and Medicare), or ""discretionary"", with payment amounts renewed annually as part of the budget process. Around two thirds of federal spending is for ""mandatory"" programs. CBO projects that mandatory program spending and interest costs will rise relative to GDP over the 2016–2026 period, while defense and other discretionary spending will decline relative to GDP.[9] Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid expenditures are funded by more permanent Congressional appropriations and so are considered mandatory spending.[31] Social Security and Medicare are sometimes called ""entitlements"", because people meeting relevant eligibility requirements are legally entitled to benefits; most pay taxes into these programs throughout their working lives. Some programs, such as Food Stamps, are appropriated entitlements. Some mandatory spending, such as Congressional salaries, is not part of any entitlement program. Mandatory spending accounted for 59.8% of total federal outlays (net of receipts that partially pay for the programs), with net interest payments accounting for an additional 6.5%. In 2000, these were 53.2% and 12.5%, respectively.[9] Mandatory spending is expected to continue increasing as a share of GDP. This is due in part to demographic trends, as the number of workers continues declining relative to those receiving benefits. For example, the number of workers per retiree was 5.1 in 1960; this declined to 3.0 in 2010 and is projected to decline to 2.2 by 2030.[32][33] These programs are also affected by per-person costs, which are also expected to increase at a rate significantly higher than economic growth. This unfavorable combination of demographics and per-capita rate increases is expected to drive both Social Security and Medicare into large deficits during the 21st century. Unless these long-term fiscal imbalances are addressed by reforms to these programs, raising taxes or drastic cuts in discretionary programs, the federal government will at some point be unable to pay its obligations without significant risk to the value of the dollar (inflation).[34][35] By one estimate, 70% of the growth in these entitlement expenses over the 2016-2046 period is due to healthcare.[36] CBO reported that net interest on the public debt was approximately $240 billion in FY2016 (6% of spending), an increase of $17 billion or 8% versus FY2015. A higher level of debt coincided with higher interest rates.[9] During FY2012, the GAO reported a figure of $245 billion, down from $251 billion. Government also accrued a non-cash interest expense of $187 billion for intra-governmental debt, primarily the Social Security Trust Fund, for a total interest expense of $432 billion. GAO reported that even though the national debt rose in FY2012, the interest rate paid declined.[56] Should interest rates rise to historical averages, the interest cost would increase dramatically. As of January 2012, public debt owned by foreigners has increased to approximately 50% of the total or approximately $5.0 trillion.[57] As a result, nearly 50% of the interest payments are now leaving the country, which is different from past years when interest was paid to U.S. citizens holding the public debt. Interest expenses are projected to grow dramatically as the U.S. debt increases and interest rates rise from very low levels to more typical historical levels.[9] Intuitively, the annual budget deficit should represent the amount added to the national debt.[58] However, there are certain types of spending (""supplemental appropriations"") outside the budget process which are not captured in the deficit computation, which also add to the national debt. Prior to 2009, spending for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan was often funded through special appropriations excluded from the budget deficit calculation. In FY2010 and prior, the budget deficit and annual change in the national debt were significantly different. For example, the U.S. added $1 trillion to the national debt in FY2008 but reported a deficit of $455 billion. Due to rules changes implemented under President Obama in 2009, the two figures have moved closer together and were nearly identical in 2013 (a CBO-reported deficit of $680 billion versus change in debt of $672 billion). For FY2014, the difference widened again, with the CBO reporting a deficit of $483 billion [59] compared to a change in total debt outstanding of $1,086 billion.[60] The total federal debt is divided into ""debt held by the public"" and ""intra-governmental debt"". The debt held by the public refers to U.S. government securities or other obligations held by investors (e.g., bonds, bills, and notes), while Social Security and other federal trust funds are part of the intra-governmental debt. As of September 30, 2012, the total debt was $16.1 trillion, with debt held by the public of $11.3 trillion and intragovernmental debt of $4.8 trillion.[61] Debt held by the public as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) rose from 34.7% in 2000 to 40.3% in 2008 and 70.0% in 2012.[62] U.S. GDP was approximately $15 trillion during 2011 and an estimated $15.6 trillion for 2012 based on activity during the first two quarters.[63] This means the total debt is roughly the size of GDP. Economists debate the level of debt relative to GDP that signals a ""red line"" or dangerous level, or if any such level exists.[64] By comparison, China's budget deficit was 1.6% of its $10 trillion GDP in 2010, with a debt to GDP ratio of 16%.[65] The CBO reported several types of risk factors related to rising debt levels in a July 2010 publication: However, since mid- to late-2010, the U.S. Treasury has been obtaining negative real interest rates at Treasury security auctions. At such low rates, government debt borrowing saves taxpayer money according to one economist.[67] There is no guarantee that such rates will continue, but the trend has remained falling or flat as of October 2012.[68] Fears of a fiscal crisis triggered by a significant selloff of U.S. Treasury securities by foreign owners such as China and Japan did not materialize, even in the face of significant sales of those securities during 2015, as demand for U.S. securities remained robust.[69] Economist Martin Wolf explained in July 2012 that government fiscal balance is one of three major financial sectoral balances in the U.S. economy, the others being the foreign financial sector and the private financial sector. The sum of the surpluses or deficits across these three sectors must be zero by definition. Since the foreign and private sectors are in surplus, the government sector must be in deficit. Wolf argued that the sudden shift in the private sector from deficit to surplus due to the global economic conditions forced the government balance into deficit, writing: ""The financial balance of the private sector shifted towards surplus by the almost unbelievable cumulative total of 11.2 per cent of gross domestic product between the third quarter of 2007 and the second quarter of 2009, which was when the financial deficit of US government (federal and state) reached its peak...No fiscal policy changes explain the collapse into massive fiscal deficit between 2007 and 2009, because there was none of any importance. The collapse is explained by the massive shift of the private sector from financial deficit into surplus or, in other words, from boom to bust.""[70] Economist Paul Krugman also explained in December 2011 the causes of the sizable shift from private sector deficit to surplus: ""This huge move into surplus reflects the end of the housing bubble, a sharp rise in household saving, and a slump in business investment due to lack of customers.""[71] Fiscal year 2018 (FY 2018) ran from October 1, 2017 through September 30, 2018. It was the first fiscal year budgeted by President Trump. The Treasury department reported on October 15, 2018 that the budget deficit rose from $666 billion in FY2017 to $779 billion in FY2018, an increase of $113 billion or 17.0%. In dollar terms, tax receipts increased 0.4%, while outlays increased 3.2%. Revenue fell from 17.2% GDP in 2017 to 16.4% GDP in 2018, below the 50-year average of 17.4%. Outlays fell from 20.7% GDP in 2017 to 20.3% GDP in 2018, equal to the 50-year average.[10] The 2018 deficit was an estimated 3.9% of GDP, up from 3.5% GDP in 2017.[72] CBO reported that corporate income tax receipts fell by $92 billion or 31% in 2018, falling from 1.5% GDP to 1.0% GDP, approximately half the 50-year average. This was due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This accounted for much of the $113 billion deficit increase in 2018.[10] During January 2017, just prior to President Trump's inauguration, CBO forecast that the FY 2018 budget deficit would be $487 billion if laws in place at that time remained in place. The $779 billion actual result represents a $292 billion or 60% increase versus that forecast.[3] This difference was mainly due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which took effect in 2018, and other spending legislation.[73] In Januar y 2017, the Congressional Budget Office reported its baseline budget projections for the 2018-2027 time periods, based on laws in place as of the end of the Obama administration. CBO forecasted that the sum of annual deficits (or increase in ""debt held by the public"") would be $9.4 trillion. These increases are primarily driven by an aging population, which impacts the costs of Social Security and Medicare, along with interest on the debt.[12] As President Trump introduces his budgetary policies, the impact can be measured against this baseline forecast. For example, CBO forecast in April 2018 that the debt increase for the 2018-2027 period would be $11.7 trillion if laws in place as of April 2018 were continued into the future (i.e., CBO April 2018 current law baseline). This was an increase of $2.3 trillion or 24% from the January 2017 baseline forecast; changes were mainly due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. CBO also provided an alternate scenario in April 2018 assuming current policies continue, which assumed that individual income tax cuts scheduled to expire in 2025 would be extended. The debt addition forecast in the alternate scenario is $13.7 trillion, a $4.3 trillion or 45% increase versus the January 2017 baseline.[3] CBO also estimated that if policies in place as of the end of the Obama administration continued over the following decade, real GDP would grow at approximately 2% per year, the unemployment rate would remain around 5%, inflation would remain around 2%, and interest rates would rise moderately.[12] President Trump's economic policies can also be measured against this baseline. The CBO estimated the impact of Trump's tax cuts and separate spending legislation over the 2018–2028 period in their annual ""Budget & Economic Outlook"", released in April 2018: The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reports its Long-Term Budget Outlook annually, providing at least two scenarios for spending, revenue, deficits, and debt. The 2019 Outlook mainly covers the 30-year period through 2049. The ""extended baseline scenario"" assumes that the laws currently on the books will be implemented, for the most part. CBO reported in June 2019 that under this scenario: ""Large budget deficits over the next 30 years are projected to drive federal debt held by the public to unprecedented levels—from 78 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019 to 144 percent by 2049. ""[74] Alternative scenarios assume something other than currently enacted laws. CBO reported in June 2019: ""If lawmakers changed current laws to maintain certain major policies now in place—most significantly, if they prevented a cut in discretionary spending in 2020 and an increase in individual income taxes in 2026—then debt held by the public would increase even more, reaching 219 percent of GDP by 2049. By contrast, if Social Security benefits were limited to the amounts payable from revenues received by the Social Security trust funds, debt in 2049 would reach 106 percent of GDP, still well above its current level.""[74] Over the long-term, CBO projects that interest expense and mandatory spending categories (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security) will continue to grow relative to GDP, while discretionary categories (e.g., Defense and other Cabinet Departments) continue to fall relative to GDP. Debt is projected to continue rising relative to GDP under the above two scenarios, although the CBO did also offer other scenarios that involved austerity measures that would bring the debt to GDP ratio down.[74] CBO reported in September 2011: ""The nation cannot continue to sustain the spending programs and policies of the past with the tax revenues it has been accustomed to paying. Citizens will either have to pay more for their government, accept less in government services and benefits, or both.""[75] Many of the debates surrounding the United States federal budget center around competing macroeconomic schools of thought. In general, Democrats favor the principles of Keynesian economics to encourage economic growth via a mixed economy of both private and public enterprise, a welfare state, and strong regulatory oversight. Conversely, Republicans and Libertarians generally support applying the principles of either laissez-faire or supply-side economics to grow the economy via small government, low taxes, limited regulation, and free enterprise.[77][78] Debates have surrounded the appropriate size and role of the federal government since the founding of the country. These debates also deal with questions of morality, income equality, and intergenerational equity. For example, Congress adding to the debt today may or may not enhance the quality of life for future generations, who must also bear the additional interest and taxation burden.[79] Political realities make major budgetary deals difficult to achieve. While Republicans argue conceptually for reductions in Medicare and Social Security, they are hesitant to actually vote to reduce the benefits from these popular programs. Democrats on the other hand argue conceptually for tax increases on the wealthy, yet may be hesitant to vote for them because of the effect on campaign donations from the wealthy. The so-called budgetary ""grand bargain"" of tax hikes on the rich and removal of some popular tax deductions in exchange for reductions to Medicare and Social Security is therefore elusive.[80] President Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law in December 2017. CBO forecasts that the 2017 Tax Act will increase the sum of budget deficits (debt) by $2.289 trillion over the 2018-2027 decade, or $1.891 trillion after macro-economic feedback. This is in addition to the $10.1 trillion increase forecast under the June 2017 policy baseline and existing $20 trillion national debt.[3] The Tax Act will reduce spending for lower income households while cutting taxes for higher income households, as CBO reported on December 21, 2017: ""Overall, the combined effect of the change in net federal revenue and spending is to decrease deficits (primarily stemming from reductions in spending) allocated to lower-income tax filing units and to increase deficits (primarily stemming from reductions in taxes) allocated to higher-income tax filing units.""[81] CBO forecast in January 2017 (just prior to Trump's inauguration) that revenues in fiscal year 2018 would be $3.60 trillion if laws in place as of January 2017 continued.[82] However, actual 2018 revenues were $3.33 trillion, a shortfall of $270 billion (7.5%) relative to the forecast. This difference is primarily due to the Tax Act.[83] In other words, revenues would have been considerably higher in the absence of the tax cuts. The New York Times reported in August 2019 that: ""The increasing levels of red ink stem from a steep falloff in federal revenue after Mr. Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, which lowered individual and corporate tax rates, resulting in far fewer tax dollars flowing to the Treasury Department. Tax revenues for 2018 and 2019 have fallen more than $430 billion short of what the budget office predicted they would be in June 2017, before the tax law was approved that December.""[84] The CBO has consistently reported since 2010 that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (also known as ""Obamacare"") would reduce the deficit, as its tax increases and reductions in future Medicare spending offset its incremental spending for subsidies for low-income households. The CBO reported in June 2015 that repeal of the ACA would increase the deficit between $137 billion and $353 billion over the 2016–2025 period in total, depending on the impact of macroeconomic feedback effects. In other words, ACA is a deficit reducer, as its repeal would raise the deficit.[85] The Medicare Trustees provide an annual report of the program's finances. The forecasts from 2009 and 2015 differ materially, mainly due to changes in the projected rate of healthcare cost increases, which have moderated considerably. Rather than rising to nearly 12% GDP over the forecast period (through 2080) as forecast in 2009, the 2015 forecast has Medicare costs rising to 6% GDP, comparable to the Social Security program.[86] The increase in healthcare costs is one of the primary drivers of long-term budget deficits. The long-term budget situation has considerably improved in the 2015 forecast versus the 2009 forecast per the Trustees Report.[87] U.S. healthcare costs were approximately $3.2 trillion or nearly $10,000 per person on average in 2015. Major categories of expense include hospital care (32%), physician and clinical services (20%), and prescription drugs (10%).[88] U.S. costs in 2016 were substantially higher than other OECD countries, at 17.2% GDP versus 12.4% GDP for the next most expensive country (Switzerland).[89] For scale, a 5% GDP difference represents about $1 trillion or $3,000 per person. Some of the many reasons cited for the cost differential with other countries include: Higher administrative costs of a private system with multiple payment processes; higher costs for the same products and services; more expensive volume/mix of services with higher usage of more expensive specialists; aggressive treatment of very sick elderly versus palliative care; less use of government intervention in pricing; and higher income levels driving greater demand for healthcare.[90][91][92] Healthcare costs are a fundamental driver of health insurance costs, which leads to coverage affordability challenges for millions of families. There is ongoing debate whether the current law (ACA/Obamacare) and the Republican alternatives (AHCA and BCRA) do enough to address the cost challenge.[93] In the wake of the 2007–2009 U.S. recession, there were several important fiscal debates around key questions: The COVID-19 pandemic in the United States impacted the economy significantly beginning in March 2020, as businesses were shut-down and furloughed or fired personnel. About 16 million persons filed for unemployment insurance in the three weeks ending April 9. It caused the number of unemployed persons to increase significantly, which is expected to reduce tax revenues while increasing automatic stabilizer spending for unemployment insurance and nutritional support. As a result of the adverse economic impact, both state and federal budget deficits will dramatically increase, even before considering any new legislation.[96] To help address lost income for millions of workers and assist businesses, Congress and President Trump enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES) on March 18, 2020. It included loans and grants for businesses, along with direct payments to individuals and additional funding for unemployment insurance. Some or all of the loans may ultimately be paid back including interest, while the spending measures should dampen the negative budgetary impact of the economic disruption. While the law will almost certainly increase budget deficits relative to the January 2020 10-year CBO baseline (completed prior to the Coronavirus), in the absence of the legislation, a complete economic collapse could have occurred.[97] CBO provided a preliminary score for the CARES Act on April 16, 2020, estimating that it would increase federal deficits by about $1.8 trillion over the 2020-2030 period. The estimate includes: CBO reported that not all parts of the bill will increase deficits: “Although the act provides financial assistance totaling more than $2 trillion, the projected cost is less than that because some of that assistance is in the form of loan guarantees, which are not estimated to have a net effect on the budget. In particular, the act authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to provide up to $454 billion to fund emergency lending facilities established by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Because the income and costs stemming from that lending are expected to roughly offset each other, CBO estimates no deficit effect from that provision.”[98] The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated that, partially as the result of the CARES Act, the budget deficit for fiscal year 2020 would increase to a record $3.8 trillion, or 18.7% GDP.[5] For scale, in 2009 the budget deficit reached 9.8% GDP ($1.4 trillion nominal dollars) in the depths of the Great Recession. CBO forecast in January 2020 that the budget deficit in FY2020 would be $1.0 trillion, prior to considering the impact of the coronavirus pandemic or CARES.[99] While the Federal Reserve is also conducting stimulative monetary policy, essentially ""printing money"" electronically to purchase bonds, its balance sheet is not a component of the national debt. The CBO forecast in April 2020 that the budget deficit in fiscal year 2020 would be $3.7 trillion (17.9% GDP), versus the January estimate of $1 trillion (4.6% GDP). CBO also forecast the unemployment rate would rise to 16% by Q3 2020 and remain above 10% in both 2020 and 2021.[100] Economists Alan Blinder and Mark Watson reported that budget deficits tended to be smaller under Democratic Presidents, at 2.1% potential GDP versus 2.8% potential GDP for Republican Presidents, a difference of about 0.7% GDP. Their study was from President Truman through President Obama's first term, which ended in January 2013.[101] According to a December 2012 Pew Research Center poll, only a few of the frequently discussed deficit reduction ideas have majority support: Fewer than 50% support raising the retirement age for Social Security or Medicare, reducing military defense spending, limiting the mortgage interest deduction, or reducing federal funding for low income persons, education and infrastructure.[102] There are a variety of proposed strategies for reducing the federal deficit. These may include policy choices regarding taxation and spending, along with policies designed to increase economic growth and reduce unemployment. For example, a fast-growing economy offers the win-win outcome of a larger proverbial economic pie, with higher employment and tax revenues, lower safety net spending and a lower debt-to-GDP ratio. However, most other strategies represent a tradeoff scenario in which money or benefits are taken from some and given to others. Spending can be reduced from current levels, frozen, or the rate of future spending increases reduced. Budgetary rules can also be implemented to manage spending. Some changes can take place today, while others can phase in over time. Tax revenues can be raised in a variety of ways, by raising tax rates, the scope of what is taxed, or eliminating deductions and exemptions (""tax expenditures""). Regulatory uncertainty or barriers can be reduced, as these may cause businesses to postpone investment and hiring decisions.[103] The CBO reported in January 2017 that: ""The effects on the federal budget of the aging population and rapidly growing health care costs are already apparent over the 10-year horizon—especially for Social Security and Medicare—and will grow in size beyond the baseline period. Unless laws governing fiscal policy were changed—that is, spending for large benefit programs was reduced, increases in revenues were implemented, or some combination of those approaches was adopted—debt would rise sharply relative to GDP after 2027.""[9] During June 2012, Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke recommended three objectives for fiscal policy: 1) Take steps to put the federal budget on a sustainable fiscal path; 2) Avoid unnecessarily impeding the ongoing economic recovery; and 3) Design tax policies and spending programs to promote a stronger economy.[104] President Barack Obama stated in June 2012: ""What I've said is, let's make long-term spending cuts; let's initiate long-term reforms; let's reduce our health care spending; let's make sure that we've got a pathway, a glide-path to fiscal responsibility, but at the same time, let's not under-invest in the things that we need to do right now to grow. And that recipe of short-term investments in growth and jobs with a long-term path of fiscal responsibility is the right approach to take for, I think, not only the United States but also for Europe.""[105] A variety of government task forces, expert panels, private institutions, politicians, and journalists have made recommendations for reducing the deficit and slowing the growth of debt. Several organizations have compared the future impact of these plans on the deficit, debt, and economy. One helpful way of measuring the impact of the plans is to compare them in terms of revenue and expense as a percentage of GDP over time, in total and by category. This helps illustrate how the different plan authors have prioritized particular elements of the budget.[106] There is significant debate regarding the urgency of addressing the short-term and long-term budget challenges. Prior to the 2008-2009 U.S. recession, experts argued for steps to be put in place immediately to address an unsustainable trajectory of federal deficits. For example, Fed Chair Ben Bernanke stated in January 2007: ""The longer we wait, the more severe, the more draconian, the more difficult the objectives are going to be. I think the right time to start was about 10 years ago.""[127] However, experts after the 2008-2009 U.S. recession argued that longer-term austerity measures should not interfere with measures to address the short-term economic challenges of high unemployment and slow growth. Ben Bernanke wrote in September 2011: ""...the two goals--achieving fiscal sustainability, which is the result of responsible policies set in place for the longer term, and avoiding creation of fiscal headwinds for the recovery--are not incompatible. Acting now to put in place a credible plan for reducing future deficits over the long term, while being attentive to the implications of fiscal choices for the recovery in the near term, can help serve both objectives.""[128] IMF managing director Christine Lagarde wrote in August 2011: ""For the advanced economies, there is an unmistakable need to restore fiscal sustainability through credible consolidation [deficit reduction] plans. At the same time we know that slamming on the brakes too quickly will hurt the recovery and worsen job prospects. So fiscal adjustment must resolve the conundrum of being neither too fast nor too slow. Shaping a Goldilocks fiscal consolidation is all about timing. What is needed is a dual focus on medium-term consolidation and short-term support for growth and jobs. That may sound contradictory, but the two are mutually reinforcing. Decisions on future consolidation, tackling the issues that will bring sustained fiscal improvement, create space in the near term for policies that support growth and jobs.""[129] The budget year runs from October 1 to September 30 the following year and is submitted by the President to Congress prior to October for the following year. In this way the budget of 2013 is submitted before the end of September 2012. This means that the budget of 2001 was submitted by Bill Clinton and was in force during most of George W. Bush's first year in office. The budget submitted by George W. Bush in his last year in office was the budget of 2009, which was in force through most of Barack Obama's first year in office. The President's budget also contains revenue and spending projections for the current fiscal year, the coming fiscal years, as well as several future fiscal years. In recent years, the President's budget contained projections five years into the future. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) issues a ""Budget and Economic Outlook"" each January and an analysis of the President's budget each March. CBO also issues an updated budget and economic outlook in August. Actual budget data for prior years is available from the Congressional Budget Office; see the ""Historical Budget Data"" links on the main page of ""The Budget and Economic Outlook"".[131] and from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).[132] One of the best ways to understand the long-term budget risks is through helpful charts.

"by Brett Stevens on April 13, 2011 I never wanted to be a Republican. What an un-hip, stodgy, unpleasantly financial aura hovered around that word! As I went on through life, I found out that I like consequentialist logic — results matter more than methods, in a nutshell — which put me on the Republican side. I liked and still like the practicality of it, and how it escapes the bad mental state of seeing oneself as a victim of life itself. While the Republicans aren’t ideal, they let many disparate right-oriented groups gather under one “big tent” and work together. Since we who are anywhere near the right are a marginalized group since the Magna Carta, situational unity is important. Pick the best horse and ride it. This recent budget crisis and threatened government shutdown reveals what the Republicans aren’t good at, however: they have zero knowledge about how to manage a publicity campaign based on spin. Sure, they’re good at explaining necessary actions like wars, but those explanations assume their audience is rational and not wholly biased against them already. What Republicans cannot do is make anything hip, fun or aesthetically sensible. But Republicans arenâ€™t putting out press releases about government programs that escaped the ax. Theyâ€™re all about the sea change in Washingtonâ€™s approach to spending since the GOP took control of the House. â€œNever before has Congress made dramatic cuts such as those that are in this final legislation,â€ said Rep. Hal Rogers (R) of Kentucky, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, in a statement Tuesday. â€œThe nearly $40 billion reduction in non-defense spending is nearly five times larger than any other cut in history, and is the result of this new Republican majorityâ€™s commitment to bring about real change in the way Washington spends the peopleâ€™s money.â€ In fact, the House committee scored the bill as cutting $39.9 billion in spending compared with the fiscal year 2010 budget. In the estimation of Senate appropriators, the cuts came to $38.5 billion. – CSM We’re talking about a $3.5 trillion expenditure, and they’ve trimmed $40 billion. That’s not very substantial. Republicans would do better if they had their backs against a wall, and could actually get radical, and trim what they want to: Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid expenditures are funded by permanent appropriations and so are considered mandatory spending. Social Security and Medicare are sometimes called “entitlements,” because people meeting relevant eligibility requirements are legally entitled to benefits, although most pay taxes into these programs throughout their working lives. Some programs, such as Food Stamps, are appropriated entitlements. Some mandatory spending, such as Congressional salaries, is not part of any entitlement program. Mandatory spending accounted for 53% of total federal outlays in FY2008, with net interest payments accounting for an additional 8.5%. – Google Group Blog This is what the Republican audience — conservatives of all stripes — want cut. We are OK with large military investment, and some charity, but not this across-the-board entitlement state. On the other hand are those who want the entitlement state. They want it because they believe it will lead to pacification of class- and race-warfare, that supporting it makes them look good to their friends, and because they hope it will create a society where everyone is taken care of (in other words, a benevolent form of socialism). However, the divide is more fundamental: Entitlement states are moribund states because, by re-distributing wealth and power, they create a state of entropy. Equality is entropy. If all options are about the same, no one “does” anything constructive or creative — what they do is find destructive ways to profit and extract wealth from the credulous consumer mass. Republicans want a meritocratic state where the power and money go to the most competent, so that the nation grows in power; Democrats want everyone to be included, so that the country avoids internal conflict. They hope to fund that by taxing the “rich,” or people earning over $250,000. The problem with that idea is that then instead of taxing the actual rich, you’re taxing the doctors, lawyers, architects and accountants who keep your professional class thriving. To add insult to injury, it won’t bring in enough money: First, the income of the top 2% of taxpayers is typically more volatile than that of taxpayers lower down the income scale, so when the economy sours, so often do those high-end income streams. That means less revenue than expected will flow into federal coffers. Second, even if that weren’t true, there just aren’t enough rich people to generate the kind of revenue needed to substantially reduce deficits. To show the disparity, consider some recent calculations by the Congressional Budget Office. Raising all six income tax rates by 1 percentage point would yield an additional $480 billion over 10 years. By contrast, raising the top two rates by 1 percentage point would yield just $115 billion. – Money Republicans need to stop being coy about this, and call the Democrats on their bad behavior. This budget stalemate was not caused by Republicans insisting on purely ideological provisions regarding de-funding NPR and Planned Parenthood. This is about the budget, yes… but it’s also about a culture war. Democrats want wealth re-distribution for social programs; Republicans want social Darwinism and re-investment in the collective of American society. Republicans should see they have the mandate of many people in this country to not just make a few cuts, but to slash out half of our budget and put us on a healthier track. They should not lose their nerve, like last round: Another reason the Obama White House may have wanted to avoid a government shutdown is that a full reading of the history of the 1995-96 budget confrontation between Mr. Clinton and Newt Gingrich offers a more sobering analysis of what happened. Republicans lost that fight for reasons that had less to do with “extremism” and more to do with key GOP players losing their nerve. In a memoir of his days as a top aide in the Clinton White House, George Stephanopoulos, now with ABC News, says the Democratic White House was very close to blinking over the demands of GOP budget-cutters in Congress. They were thrilled when Bob Dole, the Senate GOP leader who was running for president, blinked first out of concern that the confrontation would damage his presidential prospects. – WSJ Republicans have the mandate for change, but as said above, they have no idea how to market it. Democrats, who are better at passive aggression, nail it: “We’d have this budget compromise fixed already if it weren’t for the Republicans, insisting on these two smidgens of detail about NPR and Planned Parenthood. Why can’t they just be more tolerant?” Of course, they don’t accept the flipside answer, which is: if these programs are such an accepted norm, why do we need government to help them out? Let them join the Salvation Army, Goodwill, Veterans of Foreign Wars and other charities. If it’s such a tiny detail, why don’t Democrats just concede the point? But the real point is showmanship. The cuts in this budget plan are trivial. Many of them are fabricated because they cut nothing, only take back money unspent by huge federal programs. This is about the Democrats standing up for their ideological vision of the pacification state, in which the military is penalized and all citizens are not only encouraged in whatever behavior they want to pursue, but subsidized by the state. If you’re afraid of fitting in, that’s a great option, because the state forces others to accept you. The Republicans need to turn this around, by going back to conservative values: we should not be obligated to pay for that which is incompatible with our worldview. If we want a socially conservative world, the federal government should not be using our tax money to create propaganda to change our minds. It’s like the election system buying voters. As always, America remains split between its conservatives and liberals, with only one of those groups benefiting from the indecision."
"Sign In President Obama serves himself more than the republic Manage Newsletters Shameless politicians use 9/11 to lecture America about “unity” Biden’s forced COVID-19 vaccine attack on minorities Dems’ totalitarian overreach threatens Americans’ livelihood White(wash) House ANALYSIS/OPINION: President Obama has all but ensured his defeat in 2012. His speech Wednesday outlining his framework for deficit reduction was a pivotal moment in his presidency - the decisive tipping point, in which he revealed his almost limitless capacity for cynicism and mendacity. He frittered away whatever credibility he had left. Mr. Obama is in full campaign mode, desperately seeking to consolidate his social democratic agenda. This is why winning re-election trumps everything else - including protecting our long-term economic security. Much of the speech focused on bashing Republicans, especially House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan’s blueprint for entitlement and tax reform. Mr. Ryan’s plan would rein in government spending, slash the federal deficit and engender economic recovery. TOP STORIES Republican points to 'leaked' Biden call, accuses administration of 'manipulating' Taliban intel 'No SALT, no deal': Vulnerable Dems threaten revolt unless $3.5T bill cuts blue-states taxes CNN poll: America turns irate, glum Instead of debating the merits of Mr. Ryan’s proposals, Mr. Obama did the very opposite: He engaged in shameless demagoguery. The president claimed the Ryan plan seeks $1 trillion in “tax cuts for billionaires and millionaires.” This is false. In fact, his budget outline is revenue-neutral. All it does is call for lower rates in exchange for eliminating tax loopholes and special exemptions, which are used mainly by the wealthy - the supposed beneficiaries of Mr. Ryan’s pro-growth reforms. There is no tax cut; it is a figment of Mr. Obama’s imagination. Moreover, the president’s own deficit commission made a similar recommendation. The panel’s goal was to create a more efficient and broader tax code. By Mr. Obama’s logic, the commission’s Democratic co-chairman Erskine Bowles is also a shill for “the rich.” Perhaps the president is confused by the fact that Mr. Ryan’s plan leaves current George W. Bush-era tax cuts in place. The idea that leaving something alone is a tax cut is the same logic that enabled Mr. Obama to refer to his own tax increases as cuts from “spending in the tax code.” The White House argues that the Obama plan is a viable alternative to the Ryan blueprint. It isn’t. It wants more spending on almost every initiative dear to Democrats - subsidizing windmills and solar panels, protecting Medicaid and Pell Grants, funding “high-speed” railways, providing tax credits for electric cars and expanding the federal education bureaucracy. Big government is not being scaled back; rather, it is being entrenched. The only area of the budget where Mr. Obama proposes real cuts is at the Pentagon, pledging to slash more than $400 billion by 2023. In short, it is the economic program of a transnational progressive: Roll back defense spending while expanding welfare liberalism. Mr. Obama does not even touch Social Security. He - again - falsely asserts that it has no immediate impact on the deficit. He also refuses to change how Medicare operates. The White House and congressional Democrats are demonizing Mr. Ryan, portraying him as someone who wants to balance the budget on the backs of seniors and the poor. It is classic divide-and-conquer politics, which seeks to pit segments of society against one another. Mr. Ryan, however, has no intention of dismantling the entitlement state. He is not a libertarian - or even a hard-boiled Goldwater-Reagan Republican. He is a neoconservative who seeks to revamp Great Society programs to make them sustainable. His proposal would not end Medicare. It would save it. The Ryan plan wants to turn it into a giant voucher program whereby premium support subsidies - starting at $15,000 per senior and rising for lower-income persons - would enable the elderly to purchase private insurance. This would encourage more choice and competition, thereby curtailing rising health costs. The reason the left despises the idea is because it would take millions of Americans off the public rolls, substituting the market for government central planning and bureaucratic control. The power of the liberal ruling class would be diminished. At its core, Mr. Obama’s speech was profoundly reactionary. He is yesterday’s man peddling yesterday’s ideas. He is hoping to preserve the bloated nanny state Democrats have erected since the New Deal. Most of the “spending cuts” he vows will eliminate about $4 trillion from the debt in 12 years are simply huge tax increases. This would cripple the private sector and take America down the European road of permanent high unemployment and low growth. It is a recipe for economic stagnation and national ruin. Mr. Obama refuses to confront the seminal reality of American life: We are going broke. The only way to keep America from heading off a financial cliff is to dramatically reverse course - repeal Obamacare, implement deep across-the-board spending cuts and reform entitlements, especially Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Together these programs constitute nearly $100 trillion in unfunded liabilities; no nation, no matter how big and prosperous, can sustain that financially. America is being drowned in an ocean of red ink. The president’s class warfare is a smoke screen. He hopes to distract voters from his immoral and reckless fiscal record. He is the one who has compiled massive deficits, which this year alone are projected to be a record $1.6 trillion. He is the one who has accumulated more debt during his administration than it took for America to amass in the first 200 years of its history combined. He is the one who is proposing trillion-dollar deficits for years to come. Now, after having wrecked the country’s finances, he is presenting himself as a born-again budget hawk. Even by Washington standards, this is preposterously self-serving. The electorate eventually will see through it; the debt crisis will compel the nation to kick Mr. Obama out of office. Samuel Johnson said that “patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel.” No, demagoguery is. Jeffrey T. Kuhner is a columnist at The Washington Times and president of the Edmund Burke Institute.

"Political Byline This blog is no longer active as of October 31, 2011 Posted onApril 16, 2011AuthorPatrick First some very disturbing video from Fox News: Now the story via Fox News Channel: On April 8th, the same day Defense Secretary Robert Gates was visiting leaders in Baghdad, a 2,500-man Iraqi Army unit raided a compound occupied by Iranian dissidents in Iraq, killing 34 people and injuring 325 others. Eight of those killed were women, according to the United Nations. The attack occurred just hours after members of the same group in Washington revealed what they said was a previously undisclosed Iranian centrifuge production facility near Tehran — part of Iran’s secret nuclear weapons program. Camp Ashraf has long served as a sanctuary for members of the anti-Iranian government group known as the People’s Mujahideen Organization of Iran (MEK) — a place the U.S. military vowed to protect shortly after the invasion of Iraq in 2003. But with only 47,000 U.S. troops still in the country, and a new Shiite-led government in Iraq looking to bolster relations with Iran, the camp is threatened. A 12-minute video released by the MEK documents the nighttime attack, beginning with images of Iraqi soldiers driving through crowds of civilians and running men over with trucks and armored Humvees. It shows soldiers firing on and killing groups of unarmed men and women. Gaping wounds suffered by survivors are displayed in detail along with images of the dead laid side by side and covered to the neck by white sheets. The Iraqi general who led the raid claims the shootings came in response to residents pelting his troops with rocks and throwing themselves in front of his military vehicles. MEK say those same soldiers are still preventing the wounded from getting proper medical treatment. MEK was designated a terrorist organization by the U.S. after it carried out an assassination campaign targeting American military leaders in Tehran in the 70’s, as well as later attacking Iranian government targets. Since then the group has become better known for revealing secret production facilities related to the Iranian nuclear program, as it did with uranium enrichment facility in Natanz in 2002. Sen. John Kerry, head of the Foreign Relations Committee, wants the Iraqis to conduct a full investigation and the called the raid “deeply disturbing” and “simply unacceptable.” Gates commented on the incident while he was in Iraq, saying he was “concerned” with the reports of deaths and injuries. And State Department spokesman Mark Toner later condemned the attack, but called it a “sovereign” matter for the Iraqis. By law, the U.S. security agreement with Iraq prohibits the U.S. military from intervening. A number of former U.S. government officials spoke out about the raid during a conference at the Mayflower hotel in Washington Thursday, many of them calling on the State Department to remove the MEK from its list of terrorist groups. Michael Mukasey, an attorney general under George W. Bush, called the Iraqi’s guarantee in 2003 to protect the group, “worthless.” He said that unless the U.S. removes the MEK from its terror list the killings will continue. “What has enabled the Iraqi government — acting in the behest of the Iranian regime — and what enables the Iranian regime itself is this continued designation,” Mukasey said. Gen. Wesley Clark, the former NATO Supreme Allied Commander, linked the incident at Camp Ashraf to current Arab uprisings in the region. “How can we hope to help those inside Iran who are seeking a more open and liberated government if we can’t help those in Camp Ashraf who are simply asking for protection and an opportunity to live their lives in peace,?” he asked. Critics say Iran is seizing on distractions in Libya by backing a Shia uprising in Bahrain and helping Syrian President Bashar Assad crack down on government protesters. Alireza Jafarzadeh, a spokesman for the MEK and the National Council of Resistance Iran, says the Iranians encouraged the Iraqis to attack Camp Ashraf. “This is a pure crime committed intentionally by the Iraqi government against the Iranian dissidents to do the bidding for Tehran,” Jafarzadeh said. The last portion of the video provided by MEK shows a 29 year-old Iranian woman, named Isiyeh Rakhshani, delivering a video message to Congress in 2010. Flash to April 8th where she’s shooting cell phone video of the attack on Ashraf. In the final frame Rakhshani’s mother is seen mourning over her dead body. I really hated to quote that all; but friends, I wanted you all to see it for yourselves; just what Bush and the Neo-Conservative warmongers in the G.O.P. created. My friends, if that does not sicken you to your core, you do not have a damned soul. In 2003, after the euphoria and outrage over 9/11, the United States of America went into a sovereign nation and invaded it; based on the lies of a man, who they call “Curveball.” America then proceeded to take a Nation, who’s army had, at best, soviet-era tanks and equipment; and proceeded to give them our very best equipment; and now, they are using it on their own damned people. Anyone who believes that Iraq is a free nation; is either lying to themselves or worse. The United States of America basically ousted one dictator and installed a new one in Iraq. Even now the most pro-war Conservative admits that. It was indeed “Mission Accomplished.” But this mission that we accomplished, was not what Bush and his Neo-Conservative friends had in mind. Now, there are people in Iraq this day, who have lost family; all because a group of Jacobin Democrats decided to invade a Country and further their warped foriegn policy fantasies. For every action, there is a reaction. For every action taken by the United States Government and its military there is “blowback.” It is an CIA term, and it is very real.

"Getty Images The Catholic religion was established in the Mediterranean region during the first century CE by a small group of Jewish men and women, one of several sects which were all bent on reforming the Jewish faith. The word ""Catholic"" (which means ""embracing"" or ""universal"") was first used to refer to the early Christian church by the bishop and martyr Ignatius of Antioch in the 1st century. According to figures from the seat of the church, the Vatican in Rome, there are currently 1.2 billion Catholics in the world today: 40 percent of them live in Latin America. The Catholic religion is monotheistic, meaning that Catholics believe that there is only one supreme being, called God. The Catholic God has three aspects, known as the Trinity. The Supreme Being is the creator, called God or God the Father, who resides in heaven and watches over and guides everything on earth. He is known as the lord of heaven and earth, and referred to as almighty, eternal, immeasurable, incomprehensible, and infinite in understanding, will, and perfection. The Holy Trinity is made up of the Father (God), who has no origin and holds the sole power of creation; the Son (Jesus Christ) of God, who shares the wisdom of the Father; and the Holy Spirit, which is the personification of goodness and sanctity, arising from both the Father and Son. The legendary Founder of the Catholic Church was a Jewish man named Jesus Christ who lived in Jerusalem and preached to a small group of followers. Catholics believe he was the ""messiah,"" the son aspect of the Trinity, who was sent to Earth and born to redeem those who sin against the true religion. Christ is said to have had a human body and a human soul, identical to other humans except that he was without sin. Important religious events which are said to have occurred in the life of Christ are a virgin birth, miracles he performed during his life, martyrdom by crucifixion, resurrection from the dead, and ascension into heaven. None of the individuals named in the Catholic religion as significant or sanctified figures have powers of creation, and as such, they are not to be worshiped, but they can be appealed to for intercession in prayers. Mary is the name of the human person who was the mother of Jesus Christ, a resident of Bethlehem and Nazareth. She was told by an archangel that she would give birth to Christ as a virgin, and would remain a virgin after the birth. On her death, her body went through the process known as ""the assumption,"" becoming the Queen of Heaven. The Apostles were the original 12 disciples of Christ: led by Peter, a Galilean fisherman who might have been a follower of John the Baptist first. The others are Andrew, James the Greater, John, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the Lesser, Jude, Simon, and Judas. After Judas committed suicide, he was replaced by Matthias. Saints are people who lived an exceptionally holy life, including many martyrs from the 2nd and 3rd centuries CE, and afterward, are said to reside eternally with God in heaven. The Pope is the supreme pastor for the Catholic church. The first pope was the apostle Peter, followed by Clement of Rome around the year 96. The main religious document of the Catholic religion is the Judeo-Christian Bible, which Catholics believe to be the inspired word of God. The text includes the Old Testament of the Hebrew religion plus the canonical books of the New Testament as they were established in the 4th century CE. Parts of the Bible are to be read as literal truth; other parts are considered poetical expressions of faith and the church leaders define which parts are which. Canonical law for Catholics emerged from Judaism in the 3rd century CE but did not become universal for the church until the 20th century. Three main works establishing the canon include Didache (""Teaching""), a Syrian document in Greek written between 90–100 CE; the Apostolic Tradition, a Greek manuscript written in either Rome or Egypt in the early 3rd century, and the Didaskalia Apostolorum (""The Teaching of the Apostles""), from northern Syria and written in the early 3rd century. There are several types of commandments—rules defining ethical behavior—that are included in Catholic dogma. The two major commandments of the Catholic religion are that believers must love God and keep his commandments. The Ten Commandments are the Jewish laws recorded in the Old Testament books of Exodus and Deuteronomy: In addition, there are six chief commandments of the Catholic church. A Catholic adhering to the laws of the church must: The seven sacraments are ways in which bishops or priests intercede with or bring grace from God to ordinary people. These are the rites of baptism; confirmation; first Eucharist; penance or reconciliation; anointing of the sick; holy orders for ordained ministers (bishops, priests, and deacons); and marriage. Prayer is an important aspect of Catholic life and there are five types of prayer performed by Catholics: blessing, petition, intercession, thanksgiving, and praise. Prayers may be directed to God or to the saints, either individually or as a litany. The main tenets of the Catholic religion are that 1) God is universal and loves everyone; 2) Jesus Christ came to save all the people; 3) not formally belonging to the Catholic church is objectively sinful, and 4) no one who is sinful makes it into heaven. The Catholic creation story says that God created the universe out of the void, first starting with the angels. One of the angels (Satan or Lucifer) rebelled and took a legion of angels with him (called Demons) and formed the underworld (Hell). Heaven is where goodness resides; Hell is where evil resides, and Earth is where evil and good are at battle. The world was created in seven days. On the first day, God created the heavens, earth, and light; the firmament on the second; the grass, herbs, and fruit trees on the third; the sun, moon, and stars on the fourth, the creatures of the air and sea on the fifth, and the creatures of the land (including the first human) on the sixth day. On the seventh day, God rested. Catholics believe that when a person dies, the soul lives on. Each soul faces a ""particular judgment,"" that is to say, God determines whether she or he has lived a good life and where she or he should spend eternity. If a person has learned to perfectly love God, her soul will go straight to heaven to enjoy endless happiness. If a person loves God imperfectly, her soul will go to Purgatory, where she will be purified before (eventually) going to heaven. If a person has rejected God's love or commits a mortal sin and dies before repenting, he is condemned to the everlasting torments of hell. Some doctrines state that there is a fourth state called ""limbo"" where resides a soul who has not been baptized but has not committed any personal sin. The Catholic church believes that Christ will return to earth to save it again, announced by signs such as famine, pestilence, natural disasters, false prophets, wars, the renewed persecution of the church, and the fading of faith. The world will end with a revolt of Satan and his demons (""The Great Apostasy""), a time of great sorrows (""The Great Tribulation""), and the appearance of an Anti-Christ, who will deceive men into believing he is a man of peace and justice. When Christ returns, the bodies of the dead will be resurrected and reunited with their souls, and Christ will make a final judgment on them. Satan and his Demons and sinning humans will be thrown into Hell; people who belong in Heaven will go there. From the earliest days of the Church, Easter has been considered the central Christian feast. Easter's date is calculated based on the phases of the moon and the spring equinox. Although there are no special rites other than going to church performed on Easter in the west, members of the Eastern Orthodox Church will often recite the Homily of St. John Chrysostom as well. Prior to Easter day is a 40-day period known as Lent, which has several important days and rites. Next in importance are the festivals at Christmas, including Advent, the 40 days before the celebrated date for the birth of Jesus Christ, as well as events afterward. Coming 50 days after Easter and 10 days after the Ascension, Pentecost marks the descent of the Holy Spirit on the apostles. For that reason, it is often called the ""the birthday of the Church."" The Catholic church is traditionally said to have been founded on Pentecost, the 50th day after its founder Jesus Christ ascended to heaven. On that day, Christ's apostle Peter preached to the ""multitudes,"" people assembled in Rome including Parthians, Medes, Elamites, and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and parts of Libya belonging to the Cyrenes. Peter baptized 3,000 new Christians and sent them back to their home countries to spread the word. The period from the Pentecost until the death of the last Apostle is known as the Apostolic Era, and it was during that time that the church went underground because of Roman persecution. The first Christian martyr was Stephen in Jerusalem  35 CE,  the same time Paul of Tarsus, who would become an important leader in the early church, was converted to Christianity while on the road to Damascus. Early church leaders met at the Council of Apostles and Elders in 49, to discuss how to modify the rules to allow new converts to be admitted, even if they were not Jews, such as lifting dietary and circumcision rules. Paul began his missionary work to Cyprus and Turkey, and he and Peter were executed in Rome. The 2nd and 3rd centuries saw continuing persecution of Christians by the Romans, who also persecuted other sects including Jewish and Manichean religious groups. The heroic ideal of martyrdom was experienced by men and women, young and old, slaves and soldiers, wives and popes. Not all Roman emperors were uniformly brutal, and during the centuries after Christianity became the state religion, they too practiced persecution of other non-Christian groups. The first Pope was Peter, although the leaders of the church were not called ""pope"" until the sixth century—Peter was officially the Bishop of Rome. There is some evidence that after Peter died, a group of bishops supervised the church in Rome, but the second official Pope was Clement in 96. The idea of a monarchical Pope was developed in the eastern part of the church and spread into Rome by the second century. Within 100 years, the control of the Bishop in Rome included regions outside of the city and Italy, through the direct intervention of Pope Stephen I. Stephen broke the church into regional precincts called dioceses and set up a three-tiered episcopate: the bishops of dioceses, the bishops of larger towns, and the bishops of the three major sees: Rome, Alexandria. and Antioch. Eventually, Constantinople and Jerusalem also became major sees. The most significant changes to the church came after the conversion of Emperor Constantine, who made Christianity the state religion in 324 CE, bringing the Christians out of the underground. The Roman Empire was eventually broken up by barbarian invaders, invaders who in turn converted to Christianity. Evangelization and conversion of central and northern Europe spread Christianity into those regions. Beginning in the early 7th century, the eastern church was threatened by the rise of Islam, although Muslim forces did not take Constantinople until 1453. Christians under the Islamic empire were a tolerated minority; eventually, a schism between eastern and western churches led to the separation of eastern (to be called Orthodox) and western (Catholic or Roman Catholic) churches. The final great schism affecting the Catholic church was in 1571, when Martin Luther led the Reformation, dividing the church and leading to the emergence of Protestantism. The differences between the Catholic and Protestant religions were one result of the 6th century Protestant Reformation of the church led by Martin Luther. Major changes Luther pushed for include the reduction in the number of sanctified and significant figures who should be prayed to, publishing the Bible in German (provided in Latin or Greek, it had been only accessible to educated authorities), and the marriage of priests. Luther was excommunicated for his beliefs. Sources"
"Political Byline This blog is no longer active as of October 31, 2011 Posted onApril 16, 2011April 17, 2011AuthorPatrick12 Comments I am an open-minded person; but this is just straight up damned wrong! ORIGINAL POST, April 15, 5 P.M.: Orange County might be a beautiful oceanfront locale, but it’s also home to Holocaust deniers, vicious anti-gay bigots and freakish big-haired televangelists. Here, one of our Republican politicians welcomed the inauguration of the first African American U.S. president in early 2009 by sending out an email that depicted a watermelon field in front of the White House. That incident drew embarrassing international attention, but now another Orange County Republican has apparently topped the watermelon imagery with another racist attack on President Barack Obama. The Weekly has obtained a copy of an email sent to fellow conservatives this week by Marilyn Davenport, a Southern California Tea Party activist and member of the central committee of the Orange County Republican Party. Under the words, “Now you know why no birth certificate,” there’s an Obama family portrait showing them as apes. (Donald Trump must be elated to finally have an explanation about Obama’s true birth circumstances.) Here’s the image attached to the email: via [UPDATED: Davenport Defiant] Racist Orange County Republican Email: President Obama and His Parents Are Apes – Orange County News – Navel Gazing. …and what might her rational be for this sort of stupidity? This: UPDATE, APRIL 16, 5:55 P.M.: This afternoon, Marilyn Davenport sent an email to fellow Orange County Republican elected officials, apologizing if anyone was offended and blasted the “liberal media” for reporting the story. “I simply found it amusing regarding the character of [President Barack] Obama and all the questions surrounding his origin of birth,” Davenport wrote. “In no way did I even consider the fact he’s half black when I sent out the email. In fact, the thought never entered my mind until one or two other people [Scott Baugh, Orange County GOP boss, and this writer] tried to make this about race . . . I received plenty of emails about George Bush that I didn’t particularly like yet there was no ‘cry’ in the media about them . . . That being said, I will NOT resign my central committee position over this matter that the average person knows and agrees is much to do about nothing.” (*Davenport’s entire statement is at the end of this article.) (****) (This is a copy of Davenport’s entire 12:24 p.m. Saturday email to other OC Republican leaders: “I’m sorry if my email offended anyone. I simply found it amusing regarding the character of Obama and all the questions surrounding his origin of birth. In no way did I even consider the fact he’s half black when I sent out the email. In fact, the thought never entered my mind until one or two other people tried to make this about race. We all know a double standard applies regarding this president. I received plenty of emails about George Bush that I didn’t particularly like yet there was no ‘cry’ in the media about them. One only has to go to Youtube or Google Images to see a plethora or lampooning videos and pictures of Obama, Bush and other politicians. That being said, I will NOT resign my central committee position over this matter that the average person knows and agrees is much to do about nothing. Again, for those select few who might be truly offended by viewing a copy of an email I sent to a select list of friends and acquaintances, unlike the liberal left when they do the same, I offer my sincere apologies to you–the email was no meant for you. For any of my friends or acquaintances who were the recipients of my email and were truly offended, please call me so I may offer a sincere verbal apology to you.”) No ma’am, you are wrong. It IS racism! Comparing a black man to a chimp, is classic racial stereotyping and it is damned wrong. The Republican Party is the party of Lincoln and this sort of stupidity should NOT be tolerated; and if this vermin of a woman does not resign, she should be removed by the Republican leadership themselves. Of course, the liberal media and bloggers are upset, as they should rightly be. There is no place for this sort of nonsense in Conservative or Republican politics. Anyone says there is, is not; in my humble opinion, a true Conservative. So, again, to this racist vermin bitch; GET THE HELL OUT OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY! …and before anyone asks, “Is not what you do here racist?” To that I answer very simply; hell to the no, it is not racist! This blog is simply a man, who politics is “right of center,” who happens to believe that the far socialist left is wrong on a number of things. It has never been, nor will it ever be about racism. I admittedly, have issues with the fact that the Democratic Party choose Barack Obama — because of his skin color, which they did. However, I do NOT ever, nor will I ever post any sort of racist imagery on this blog, ever! Oh, believe you me; I get emails all the time, “Hey this might be funny on your blog” and it is some racist tripe crap, that I would never, in a million years publish here. Hell, I have unfriended people on Facebook for this very thing. It is uncalled for, and those who do it are NOT Conservative; not in my view of what true Conservative Christianity and Republicanism is about. The real sick and sad part is; there are “Supposed” Conservatives and Republicans, who think this sort of thing is just fine. It’s humor they say; no, it is not humor, it is racism and I will not sit by and watch it. I’ve called more than one blogger out on here for it too. They’re assholes and they give us honest guys a bad name. 😡 Related: The Huffington Post: Marilyn Davenport’s Racist Email Denounced By OC GOP Others: Crooks and Liars, Associated Press, The Moderate Voice, Little Green Footballs, Pam’s House Blend, iOwnTheWorld.com, HyperVocal, Balloon Juice, The Immoral Minority, Booman Tribune, CBS Los Angeles and Mediaite Update: For you Democrats coming here and being all smug about this. Your side does it too! See Here and Here please. So, wipe that smug look off of your face! Because your party and people’s hands are just as dirty as the Republican Party’s hands are, if not worse.

Here is the litmus test. Is this a RACIST picture.  NO WHAT ONLY WHITES CAN BE “RACIST” ahhaha the “LOGIC” of liberals Which proves to me, that you sir are not a Conservative. Because for one, your IP address traces to Canada. Which is mostly liberal. There are Conservatives there, but they would never say anything like that. Some of the Paleo-Conservatives would. But most self-respecting mainstream Conservatives would be repulsed the comparing of Obama to a chimp. Sorry, but I reject that idiot notion of a moral equivalency. Anyone that understands the utter hell that black people had to endure at the hands of the American Democrats, whos party enabled, supported and even protected institutionalized racism for years; knows that what this woman did was utterly detestable and she should resign. Commie Smasher? Yeah right. 🙄 You speak like a racist bigot and that is not Conservative. This GOP Representative is a very small-minded, classless, ignorant and completely inconsequential sad excuse for a human being. It will be a long time before you get an argument out of me over that one Mary! 😉 How can this be a “racist” issue? I didn’t know that “chimpanzee” was a race! Reminds me of the kids’ old birthday ditty-“Happy Birthday to you”… you look like a monkey, and smell like one too!” It may be silly and juvenile, but it is certainly not “racist”. I guess it’s OK to have leftist protestors carry signs depicting Repubs as “Hitler”, and calling them “fascist” and “woman killers” for being Pro-Life, right? Hypocrites! RESIGN over this?…give me a break! My God, how stupid can you be? 🙄 Read your history books idiot. 😡 I’m sure Davenport is being honest when she describes what the “average person” would perceive. Unconsciously, she’s decribing the average person in HER world. Her afluent, reactionary, blatantly racist,socialy-retarded representatives of a very specific and culturally non-inclusive enclave. These are the people who sometimes miss just how racially prejudiced they are simply because they don’t spend enough time around people who aren’t just like them. Davenport represents one of those old, ugly examples of “American” that we should all hope will continue to die-off. The rest of the world is pretty damned tired of waiting for them to evolve. Makes you wonder if Davenport should consider re-making the email as self portrait. I hate to admit, but I do agree. 🙁 That thing that makes me sick to my stomach, is that some blacks, who just do not know any better; think that ALL white people are like that — and it is so damned wrong. 🙁 You’re right, Patrick. As a black man I would say that those who would classify an entire race are a segment that needs to die-out as well. There is simply to much pain wrought by those who don’t wish to have humanity for their fellow man. Those people come in a variety of colors and, in a better world, there is no place for them. Davenport only represents ONE of those groups. Unfortunately, she represents one of the groups that has the resources to be very influencial and that’s an even bigger shame. You people, when will it ever end? When will the land of the cism awaken to a new tune other than color, gender, race, creed? No matter what African Americans achieve we will always be met with some social barrier or off colored remark to keep us in social holding pen. You people??!?!?! Are you referring to Whites? Are you referring to Republicans? In case you have not noticed sir; I strongly denounced the e-mails and yes, I am a White Conservative. I am not a Republican, I say that; because of crap like this.

"Political Byline This blog is no longer active as of October 31, 2011 Posted onApril 17, 2011AuthorPatrick1 Comment You know what is worse than old racist dinosaurs in the Republican Party? This, which comes via my facebook page: Key phrase here is: I wipe my ass with the American flag! I am sorry, but there is no justification for this of Anti-American bile. If you are a minority in this Country and you feel this way; I got one thing to say to you: It just so damned happens that these same minorities, who say that they wipe their ass with the American flag, are here making a good living in this Country. Want to know why? Because they know good and damned well, that they would never be able to do that in their Country. Which is, if the truth be known, Mexico, who treats their own people like crap; and pays them like crap too. Which is why Mexicans are sneaking across that boarder, so they can make a decent wage here. Unlike this here; this is not about racism. This is about being angry about watching people, who come from another Country, trashing the values and the flag of the United States of America —- all the while making a decent living here in the United States of America. It is straight up hypocrisy of the highest order. You come to my Country, and you make a living for your family; you show some damned respect for its flag, culture and values or you get the fuck out and go back home. Just that damned plain and simple. Anyone says or believes anything different than that; is either one of three things: 1. An Anti-American 2. A Communist 3. An Asshole But then again, I might just be repeating myself. That is all.

"Finland was on Sunday night the latest European country to lurch to the right after Finnish voters protested at eurozone bailouts for EU ""squanderers"" in Greece, Ireland and Portugal. The True Finns, a Eurosceptic and anti-immigrant party aligned with Britain's Ukip, is expected to quadruple its vote to over 15 per cent after elections in Finland on Sunday. Finland has liabilities of £7.8 billion in loan guarantees to Eurozone bail-out funds – a sum of £584 for every household. Contributions to the EU budget, running at £1.5 billion a year or £284 for every Finnish family, are increasingly resented in a country that, like many others, has been hit by recession. ""We are five-and-a-half million people,"" said Tuula Kuusinen, a True Finn candidate in Helsinki. ""We have to stop giving money to every other country. We just can't afford it."" While the True Finns are not expected to break the grip on power of the ruling Centre Party and National Coalition Party, the rise of the nationalist party could derail a looming EU bail-out to Portugal. Unlike other Eurozone states, Finland puts requests for bail-out funds to a majority vote in parliament and risks defeat at the hands of an opposition coalition of the True Finns and Social Democrats, also sceptical of eurozone loans. An EU bail-out of Portugal, expected in June, must be approved unanimously by all 17 eurozone members and a Finnish Ei, or No, could plunge Europe's single currency into a new crisis. Finnish polling put the National Coalition on 21.2 per cent support with the other ruling Centre Party on 18.6 per cent. The main opposition Social Democrats polled at 18 per cent support while the True Finns came fourth on 15.4 per cent. Timo Soini, the leader of the True Finns, has pledged to work to block the Portuguese bail-out, sparking alarm in Brussels and across other EU capitals. ""The party is over,"" he said. ""Why should Finland bail anyone out? We won't hand over more Finnish money to be burned in the fire."" The Finnish election results follow major breakthroughs for right-wing populist parties in Sweden and the Netherlands last year."
"m values balance above all else. We owe it to our readers to present everybody's ideas equally and not to ignore or discredit theories simply because they lack scientifically credible arguments or facts. Nor should we succumb to the easy mistake of thinking that scientists understand their fields better than, say, U.S. senators or best-selling novelists do. Indeed, if politicians or special-interest groups say things that seem untrue or misleading, our duty as journalists is to quote them without comment or contradiction. To do otherwise would be elitist and therefore wrong. In that spirit, we will end the practice of expressing our own views in this space: an editorial page is no place for opinions. Get ready for a new Scientific American. No more discussions of how science should inform policy. If the government commits blindly to building an anti-ICBM defense system that can't work as promised, that will waste tens of billions of taxpayers' dollars and imperil national security, you won't hear about it from us. If studies suggest that the administration's antipollution measures would actually increase the dangerous particulates that people breathe during the next two decades, that's not our concern. No more discussions of how policies affect science either-so what if the budget for the National Science Foundation is slashed? This magazine will be dedicated purely to science, fair and balanced science, and not just the science that scientists say is science. And it will start on April Fools' Day. Scientific American is a trademark of Scientific American, Inc., used with permission Â© 2011 Scientific American, a Division of Nature America, Inc.All Rights Reserved. By contrast, a subset of modern evolutionary theory states that ""Dinosaurs became extinct roughly 65 million years before the first humans."" This is falsifiable. Lets say an archeological team discovered a fossilized brontosaurus near a pyramid site in Egypt. Let's also say the brontosaurus had a block shaped like it was used in constructing the pyramids strapped to its head. Let's further say that the brontosaurus was found in the same soil layer that you'd expect other ancient Egyptian artifacts to be found in. And then lets say they found another brontosaurus near the Mayan pyramids. And one near the Great Wall of China. Eventually, science would come to the conclusion that humans and dinosaurs coexisted. (The fact that no one has been able to do this points to the strength of the original theory.) The statements ""Man is causing Global Warming"" and ""Man is not causing Global Warming,"" by contrast, are both falsifiable. A lot of the ""Man is causing Global Warming"" science is hard to falsify, but that's because the people doing that research are hiding their original numbers and only using massaged data to ""hide the decline"" in the amount of Global Warming taking place. For once, a scientist put out an easily falsified Global Warming theory, that is ""By 2010, there would be 50 million climate refugees, and they'd come from these specific places."" 2010 has come and gone, and there aren't 50 million climate refugees. Therefore, his falsifiable statement has been proven false. The correct scientific thing to do is to discard his prediction and move on. Moving on means making changes to similar predictions that are based on the same data, or directly on his prediction. It means giving up whatever money was set aside to deal with the climate refugees. It means maybe next time, listening to the people who say that there won't be 50 million climate refugees in the next five years. It doesn't mean mocking the people who disagreed with the original prediction for something that has nothing to do with what they said or did. A challenge to a theory isn't ""an attack on science,"" but refusing to let go of an idea that has clearly been proven false is. The theory there would be 50 million climate refugees in the next five years . . . Technically, that would be a hypothesis, not a theory. Also, the quote from the GP: 'For once, a scientist put out an easily falsified Global Warming theory, that is ""By 2010, there would be 50 million climate refugees, and they'd come from these specific places."" ' is in line with TFA, but does not jibe with the report that TFA purports to refute. looks like that was an april fools joke that doesn't make the article any less insightful. The first 4 paragraphs are not practical joke funny, they're irony and sarcasm. The last paragraph is the only traditional 'joke' part of the story, but the rest of it is definitely insightful, as the article itself clearly recognizes. There are lots of comedy shows that use comedy to be insightful about the political process after all. Ironically the anti-ICBM stance from 6 years ago might have been wrong. Though obviously the success and failure of ant Woosh! The clue is in the title: ""Scientific American""... it is a journal that believes the scientific method is the best method to use when trying to interpret information. I guess if you prefer another methodology for resolving diverging points of view, interpreting data or explaining unknown phenomena you need to choose another journal? Something with a title like ""Politics weekly"" ""Sociological review"" ""Religious opinions"" or so forth? Whether or not the scientific method is the best method to resolve al Not scary that the predictions are wrong, but that populations in those locations are increasing. We'd better hope these climate change predictions continue being very, very wrong. Anyone know if the regions in China on the map that show droughts are the same places experiencing droughts now? ... but here in Vietnam we DO hear quite a bit about the rapid encroachment (and salinization) by the ocean into the Mekong delta. It is clear that with the ocean coming in (I seem to remember an encroachment figure of 1.4km/yr.) and that hundreds of thousands have already been displaced because they can no longer farm there. (This has driven the growth of the big cities which is where I live). The government is constantly projecting that millions more will move in the next few decades (This is from their Thanh Nhien News which is a pretty widely read paper, there's an English website you can visit). Of course matters will soon be made even worse as upstream countries start damming the Mekong. (They may be doing so because the freshwater source in the Himalayas is losing its snowpack cover.

In fact the ability for science to change is one of the most basic requirements for something to be science. Scientific fact is ALWAYS based on the data and knowledge we have available at the time and can change if new data and knowledge come available. Just because the exact nature of the theory and its associated hypothesis have changed doesn't mean that the basic theory itself has necessarily been invalidated. An example would be Newton's laws with No, but I read the title of the summary. ""What happened to the climate refugees?"" And, I can answer that. They've all taken refuge, hiding in all the alrmist's cavernous asses. I suspect that Al Gore is hosting an entire clan in his fat ass! And, if it weren't filled with vacuum (HA!

Global warming can't stand up to the criticism they give other kinds of faith, but is regarded as not only science but the holy grail of science. With so many people posting their own version of facts, it helps knowing the past history of such people, so that you can disregard their claims. What made me google for this Anthony Watts was the claims he made that the UN had predicted 50 million refugees coming from Bahamas (population 330000), St. Lucia (population 173765), and Seychelles (population 84000). With numbers like these, something looks wrong. So I googled for the original study [osce.org] to find out what it said. it was no surprise that neither Bahamas, Seychelles, or St. Lucia were mentioned there. What it says is that there are million of refugees coming from regions affected by desertification and that number is increasing [thenewamerican.com]. And you know what's the funny thing about all this? If you take the trouble to actually read the paper Dr. Norman Myers wrote, you will notice that he does not mention global warming at all. What he calls ""environmental refugees"" are, in his own words, ""people who can no longer gain a secure livelihood in their homelands because of drought, soil erosion, desertification, deforestation and other environmental problems, together with associated problems of population pressures and profound poverty. In their desperation, these people feel they have no alternative but to seek sanctuary elsewhere, however hazardous the attempt."" In their haste to deny global warming, people like Anthony Watts do not even try to find out who they should write against... Other points to note are: 1) Some wars are fought over resources - like the Kenya-Ethiopia conflicts. So are those war refugees also environmental refugees? Its not very clear who you count. 2) The UN article started with a total of 25 million environmental refugees in 1995 and predicted it could double by 2010. That's where the 50 million number comes from. I don't see anyone providing the actual number now. How far off are they? It's sampling bias. The same poppycock that results in people believing things like ""deaths come in threes"" or that there are a massively larger number of earthquakes worldwide versus how many there were before we had the ability to measure and detect them like we do today. Well, the news says it is the worst weather (and the highest count of tornados) since 50 years.If it bleeds it leads. This is sensationalist news, nothing more, nothing less. And highest count in 50 years? Well in the US they only have about 50 years worth of tornado tracking that's considered reliable in most places, and some of those are only reliable to 1970, but tornado numbers have been far higher. Hell where I live the 'accurate temperature and tornado count' is only goes back to about 1973. Well, the news says it is the worst weather (and the highest count of tornados) since 50 years.

Here is a link to the map, whuch the UN took down but was still to be found in Google's cache.  [wordpress.com] The cache of the original page:  [googleusercontent.com] If you take a look at the map in your link, you'll find it signed ""Emanuelle Bournay - Oktober 2007"". The allegation is that UN predicted in 2005 that there would be 50 million climate refugees. Nowhere in that map one sees mention of how many refugees there would be, it just shows the regions more likely to be affected by global warming. The map sited this [google.com](PDF) paper as a source. That paper was written in 2005. Emanuelle Bournay was the cartographer who drew the map. From the paper: As far back as 1995 (latest date for a comprehensive assessment), theseenvironmental refugees totalled at least 25 million people, compared with 27 milliontraditional refugees (people fleeing political oppression, religious persecution andethnic troubles). The environmental refugees total could well double between 1995and 2010. Moreover, it could increase steadily for a good while thereafter as growingnumbers of impoverished people press ever harder on over-loaded environments.When global warming takes hold, there could be as many as 200 million peopleovertaken by disruptions of monsoon systems and other rainfall regimes, by droughtsof unprecedented severity and duration, and by sea-level rise and coastal flooding.

The facts aren't contrary. This was a completely valid prediction. The election of Barack Obama prevented this. ""This was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal."" -- Barack Obama, 3 June 2008, upon winning his party nomination. What happened to them was that they were rebranded as ""economic refugees"" or ""fortune seekers"" and left to starve. The lucky ones are called ""illegal aliens"" (wouldn't want to make them sound human now would we) and work shitty jobs for slave wages.World wide food prices have doubled. Changing climate is one factor contributing to that. Revolutions are always economic in nature, and North Africa is all revolutions these days. It is happening right now but if you refuse to look then you won't see anything. O I really hope you're joking... otherwise, this is basically evil. It's okay to lie to the people, as long as it's supposedly in service of what you think is a greater good? This is exactly why so many smart people don't believe in AGW. People see that you're lying about this, and they start to wonder what else you're lying about. Add up the lies and ridiculous hyperbole about what global warming is going to do, the blatant money-making schemes (see carbon credits), the political power-grabs by the same people who have been trying to grab more and more power for decades, the ad-homium attacks against the opposition, and the ineffective things that we're supposed to do to stop it, and it's no wonder that so many people think that it's all a giant scam. People need to understand what a problem these kind of tactics are. The reason is that many of the ""Ok for use with GW because it is so important,"" tactics are that of con men. For example requiring complete acceptance of the claims and shouting down anyone who questions it as a denier or an idiot, that's a favourite of con men. That's how they distract from their lack of evidence, it to attack anyone who dares question their claims. Another favourite is claiming consensus. This one is used by the most commo I think you're being too harsh on the actual AGW proponents. In my experience the scientists actually make fairly conservative claims, ""the lies and ridiculous hyperbole about what global warming is going to do"" mostly come from the AGW-deniers. They either blow out of proportion some isolated statement from a scientist, or in this case heavily distort the original report to make it sound ridiculous. As to why so many smart people believe in AGW, I think this article is a great illustration. If you just read If we can disregard any research or claims that are funded by the coal and oil industry, because their backers have a stake in things, can that go the other way? Can we disregard any research funded by a green group, or someone with carbon credit stakes? Both stand to gain from pushing anthropomorphic global warming (yes green groups stand to gain, more money, more influence, more of their agendas get implemented). How about stuff financed by the UN? They have a stake in it too as it would give them more co It's because many people's minds can't even grasp an issue that has 200 year-scale inertia.""Oh, it didn't happen this year. See. They're lying."" Comments like that just show the profound totalmisunderstanding about the scale in space and time of these phenomena.Read ""Climate Wars"" by Gwynne Dyer.

We are not responsible for them in any way. This article clearly demonstrates what's wrong with America's science reporting. If the UN had released a report claiming 50 million global warming refugees by 2010, there would be dozens of news articles on it. The supposed incriminating evidence is a Google Cache page with this map [grida.no] that doesn't itself say anything about refugees, but does highlight areas most susceptible to sea level rise. The ""50 million climate refugees by 2010 [googleusercontent.com]"" statement is not referenced anywhere in any UN report, it's a six words on one defunct graphic that was part of a larger report on world agriculture [grida.no] by the UN University. This 50 million by 2010 figure comes from Dr. Bogardi at the UN University in Bonn [guardian.co.uk], NOT the United Nations. The problem with this prediction being made by any scientist is that keeping track of how many refugees there are is difficult (current estimate by the UN is 1 million a year [unep.org], a figure that the Red Cross lends support to with the statement that environmental disasters are displacing more people than war now) and the causes are debatable. The epic flooding in Pakistan created 10 million refugees [reuters.com], Hurricane Katrina added a quarter of a million refugees [www.cbc.ca], and desertification in Africa is displacing millions. Can we blame these events on Global Warming? Hurricanes and floods happen without a warming world, but a warming world increases the chances of such disasters happening. Then there are the refugees that no one realizes. In the small coastal town where I live in North Carolina, houses have been falling into the swamp one by one for decades, but the residents blame it on people building their homes in flood zones, not realizing that sea levels in their state have risen three times the rate of rise on the rest of the Atlantic coast [sciencedaily.com]. People didn't build their homes in the water, the water rose 1.5 meters over the 50 years since they were built, but nobody realizes this because of landscape amnesia [wikipedia.org]. You can read all about the various estimates concerning environmental refugees on Wikipedia [wikipedia.org]. It took the author of this untruth less than an hour to post their nonsense and the deniers flooded the Internet with it quickly. It took me two hours to research and write this response, because I wanted to know what I was talking about, and I will only reach a very small audience in comparison. This is why I despair when considering how science could possibly stand a chance against the overwhelming confidence ignorance brings the unscientific masses. ""sea levels in their state have risen three times the rate of rise on the rest of the Atlantic coast [sciencedaily.com]."" What the quoted article actually says: ScienceDaily (Oct. 29, 2009) — An international team of environmental scientists led by the University of Pennsylvania has shown that sea-level rise, at least in North Carolina, is accelerating. Researchers found 20th-century sea-level rise to be three times higher than the rate of sea-level rise during the last 500 years. In addition, this jump Looks like you didn't read either. ""Furthermore, the acceleration appears consistent with other studies from the Atlantic coast, though the magnitude of the acceleration in North Carolina is larger than at sites farther north along the U.S. and Canadian Atlantic coast and may be indicative of a latitudinal trend related to the melting of the Greenland ice sheet."" The article does state that NC's coast is creeping more quickly than at other points along the Atlantic coast. ""It seems more than a little illogical to state that sea levels rise higher in one Atlantic coast state than the others."" Nothing illogical. 'Sea level' is an averaged value, which depends on currents and winds. ""And the primary sea level rise occurred well before the evil auto culture."" Coal was used in large quantities even before automobiles. ""But then I'm just an ignoramus according to the above post."" And here we both agree. Also not in the news is the fact that the sea level used to be a LOT higher than it is now and it used to be a LOT lower than it is now. Things change. That's life. None of it had anything to do with humans. The planet has also been warmer and cooler in the past. When the planet was warmer there was more diversity of life, large swaths of land that are currently too cold for much bio-diversity were more useable by nature and man. When it got colder it was hell. Things change. Given my druthers I would take w Close. The right starting and ending letters...different middle, ""pula"". po----tion Cut po-pula-tion. Nothing we do will matter if we don't stop incenting new babies and let the population naturally fall to 3 billion (even 2 billion- the planet would be a paradise with 2 billion). If you don't take these measures now- you STILL have take them when we hit 9 billion (10 billion... 11 billion) and life will be a lot more miserable then with dead fisheries, high cellulose fruits and vegetables and no meat except for the wealthy. We can fix most of these problems in one generation. I'd say you are an order of magnitude off of ""paradise"" - we need to get to around 250 million if we want ""sustainable"". Even trying to cut the population in half (more than half, really) would require nearly preventing all births for 10-20 years. Sure, it is possible but it is entirely possible that you would wreck the motivation people have for having children completely. If you push too hard on this there is the possiblity that people will just give up. This is a factor that some of the more radical environmentalists refuse to accept - that if you push hard enough the result will be that people will just give up entirely. All it takes is about 15 years of zero birthrate and you're not going to get it back, ever. Absolutely it is hard to disincent the drive to reproduce - but if you succeed the result could be catastrophic. How hard would you have to push? Well, in the US and Western Europe today the population growth is negative. Many people feel that it isn't fair to bring children into a world of declining expectations and looming destruction of the environment. Mostly this is among educated young people. In the US we are left with immigration as the only population growth factor there is and I suspect Western Europe is pretty much the same way. This portends some very drastic changes in the coming decades as the population shifts away from educated European-extracted peoples and towards Latin American folks that have been subsistance farming for generations and no goals higher than survival. In most inner cities today the idea of the straight-A student is a subject of ridicule, as is the idea of going to college - what, do you want to be seen as trying to prove yourself better than your peers? The Earth gets something like 10000X times more energy every day than we use that day in our civlization.  [treehugger.com] So what is the problem you are so worried about? There is room for quadrillions of people living in space habitats in the solar system, too. Why be such a doomster? Renewable energy is now close to the price of fossil fuels, but without the environmental costs (where fossil fuel If it's warm AND MOIST, then the planet will indeed support more diversity. But that diversity takes time to evolve (not just centuries) and I don't think people would give it an opportunity. For that matter, life over most of the globe was a lot more diverse before people invented archery and nets. This is true whether it was warm, cool, or cold. The only exception is the tropical rain forests, where the climate was so intense that most tools were quickly destroyed by it.

Stop whining about me lighting your house on fire. Houses have burned before in this area and houses will burn again. None of it had anything to do with humans. Sure I poured gasoline on all the bushes around your house and threw a match into the mix... but it's not like ""a burning bush"" is a new phenomenon--we even have documentation of this in biblical times. Relax! What you're saying is true in terms of the climate lag, but your understanding of what it means is miles off. The fact that warming cycles due to orbital changes are followed by changes in atmospheric CO2 does not invalidate or in any way call into question the fact that CO2 causes additional atmospheric warming, nor that anthropogenic emissions have caused substantial warming.

It seems more than a little illogical to state that sea levels rise higher in one Atlantic coast state than the othersNot illogical, only it takes some analysis to understand.What happens is that the global warming is causing the ocean water to become less dense, both by dilution by melted ice and by thermal expansion from the increased temperature.The surface of the ocean is approximately an ellipsoid whose exact shape depend on a number of factors.

Maybe because its fallacious assertions are repeated on /., a U.S.-based website, possibly to be picked up by larger and larger U.S. ""news"" outlets. This article clearly demonstrates what's wrong with America's science reporting. America has no science reporting. It has sciency reporting, in the Steven-Colbert ""truthiness"" sense. Now consider that the media is the main way that ""climate change"" gets communicated to the people of America. The media... and politicians. Is there any surprise that lots of people are insanely skeptical of it? I'd even say that with those inputs, calling it all a load of nonsense is a very rational response. Citing a report from the UN University, UNEP said that there were now more than 19 million people officially recognized as “persons of concern” – people who are likely to be displaced because of environmental disasters. UNEP said that figure is expected to grow to about 50 million by the end of 2010.That article clearly demonstrates what's wrong with the UN's science reporting.

Another data point for the hypothesis that climate denialism correlates with stupidity, I guess. Mart It doesn't say ""at risk"", it says ""likely"". And the reasons are for climate reasons, although not all due to rising sea levels. This correlates with the story  printed which is that 50M refugees were predicted due to climate reasons. And the real numbers were much much lower. The climate change issue has been so poorly represented on both sides. One side says nothing is happening at all. While the other makes overly dire predictions and draws unprovable conclusions (Katrina is due to global warming) in One side says nothing is happening at all.You know, I've never actually heard anyone saying this. The contention of the skeptical side is that the current warming trend is not anthropogenic.For myself, my major problem is that the catastrophic positive temperature feedback predicted by the people who believe the warming is anthropogenic makes no sense and has little evidence historically to back it up.

They claimed that raising meat is responsible for more global warming than transportation (e.g., cars). This became widely quoted and used as an excuse by the vegan crowd for trying to force every to stop eating meat. The problem was the report was full of errors and in general a fraud. It didn't include the full costs of transportation yet it over included the costs for livestock resulting in totally distorted numbers. More importantly it there are now about 19.2 million people officially recognized as ""persons of concern""-that is, people likely to be displaced because of environmental disasters. This figure is predicted to grow to about 50 million by the end of the year 2010.Note that the number is not environmental refugees, but actually persons of concern. There is a huge difference between the two, and the second is probably not inaccurate. Now, on the website in question, UNEP said thisFifty million climate refugees by 2010This is obviously not what the original researchers were claiming. Who knows why UNEP put that on their website, but it is most likely an error of their PR agency, not of their science. In short, the scientists were probably right, but the propagandaists were wrong. there are now about 19.2 million people officially recognized as ""persons of concern""-that is, people likely to be displaced because of environmental disasters.

Another favourite of mine is that hurricanes were going to be rampaging across the Atlantic due to the warming. Catrina being just the start. That is why Al Gores book is covered with photoshopped hurricanes including one turning in the wrong direction. Only problem is that hurricane activity has dramatically dropped since Catrina. Yet we are expected to spent trillions with a T of dollars based on these predictions from computer models that can't be verified in any way, haven't had their code released for review or had their algorithms reviewed.

Just look at the disaster wind power has become for the UK and others to see what the problems are. 1.

Bonn is a tiny university town andalready has one big university, the aptly-named University of Bonn, so I was suprised to discover thatit had another university hiding somewhere. As it turn out the ""UN university"" consists of four levels of a UN office building in the middle of the UN compound. From the website ""The offices of UNU-EHS are located on the 22nd and 26th-28th floor of the Langer Eugen building on the UN Campus."" It is fully funded by the UN and has nothing to do with Germany or Bonn. You made it sound like its some kind of private institute using the UN name, but its not. To call it a part of the UN is completely accurate. Currently we're seeing an unparalled scare campaign by the UN and some environmental organizations based on the same data that three decades ago showed an iceage approaching Can someone provide some links regarding those organizations?I learned 1975 that we likely run into a global warming, and I never heard about anyone proclaiming an approaching ice age. After all the next ice age is due in 35k years and not in the next 100 ... that is a complete nonsense claim. (Considering that we don't even know by what ice ages are caused ...)angel'o'sphere For certain spacings, yes. In this case, putting a solar panel on every plot of 299ksq (so a 15 k square or hex grid) should do it. To be fair-- you are including mountains (darn high installation expenses!), swamps, etc.I'm sure there will be a subset. And there are multiple kinds of solar power. And if the power isn't 100% sufficient, you apparently need to keep the gas/oil turbines spinning at a low rate so they can ramp up when the wind dies or the clouds block a section. Still, most houses could be powere If yo would read what he posted and compare it what you post, you would see: you are wrong.Average all over the world as you calculate, might be 16.5cm but at that particular place it is 1.5m Do you get it? At that particular place that was very clearly written in the orignal post. angel'o'sphere Shouldn't we be happy that it didn't happen.. instead of gloating about it? these people are dangerous. we must be pointing this out at every opportunity and never forget that this whole Global Warming er i mean Climate Change is nothing more then a political movement. it seeks to control, regulate and enslave everyone... all under the premise that the world needs saving and their way is the only true way. convert or die. what should be scaring the hell out of everyone is the very 1984, Winston Smith way they went about trying to edit their propaganda. what happens when they learn The world was always coming to an end, the Apocalypse was just around the corner, you were a sinner, you needed to change your ways, but buy some indulgences and we'll let you off the hook. Hurry, sign here, The End is Near. Nowadays, The Roman Catholic Church is out of the Apocalypse & Indulgences business, so the Church of Global Warming has risen to fill the void. Same threats and labels (replace ""heretic"" with ""denier""), same hucksterism (replace ""indulgences"" with ""carbon credits""), same promotion Sure, we're in an Ice Age [wikipedia.org], and in an interglacial period where we'd expect ice sheets to be retreating and temperatures warming, but give me money and power and I'll put a stop to it!

Scientific American (irony not intended) Okay, We Give UpWe feel so ashamedBy The Editors | Friday, April 1, 2005 | 55 There's no easy way to admit this. For years, helpful letter writers told us to stick to science. They pointed out that science and politics don't mix. They said we should be more balanced in our presentation of such issues as creationism, missile defense and global warming. We resisted their advice and pretended not to be stung by the accusations that the magazine should be renamed Unscientific American, or Scientific Unamerican, or even Unscientific Unamerican. But spring is in the air, and all of nature is turning over a new leaf, so there's no better time to say: you were right, and we were wrong.In retrospect, this magazine's coverage of so-called evolution has been hideously one-sided. For decades, we published articles in every issue that endorsed the ideas of Charles Darwin and his cronies. True, the theory of common descent through natural selection has been called the unifying concept for all of biology and one of the greatest scientific ideas of all time, but that was no excuse to be fanatics about it. Where were the answering articles presenting the powerful case for scientific creationism? Why were we so unwilling to suggest that dinosaurs lived 6,000 years ago or that a cataclysmic flood carved the Grand Canyon? Blame the scientists. They dazzled us with their fancy fossils, their radiocarbon dating and their tens of thousands of peer-reviewed journal articles. As editors, we had no business being persuaded by mountains of evidence. Moreover, we shamefully mistreated the Intelligent Design (ID) theorists by lumping them in with creationists. Creationists believe that God designed all life, and that's a somewhat religious idea. But ID theorists think that at unspecified times some unnamed superpowerful entity designed life, or maybe just some species, or maybe just some of the stuff in cells. That's what makes ID a superior scientific theory: it doesn't get bogged down in details. Good journalis"

"They were going to literally lasso the effing sun … But have you seen the version of Casablanca that’s about Interpol chasing a nuclear scientist? Be kind, rewind time. He was one of the most talked about men of his time, traveling the globe and speaking in front of 25,000 at Madison Square Garden. Sure, Homer Simpson might be a downtrodden schmuck, but at least he’s in the Baseball Hall of Fame. You can tell a lot about a civilization by the taxes it collects. Throughout history, governments have used high taxes to try to discourage certain behaviors (like smoking) and cash in on others. So it's very telling and/or frightening that at various times governments have taxed ... Over a million people lived in ancient Rome, and one of the big problems was what to do with all those bodily fluids that leaked out of the citizens in an era when advanced plumbing wasn't really a thing. We're talking about an amount of urine that could quickly turn their city into Venice. photos.com Ew. No. Just ... ew. The Romans liked keeping their city neat and therefore had lots of public toilets scattered throughout the city. They also famously had a sewage system, but not surprisingly, not every toilet was connected to it. Not by a long shot. All those public toilets just had large containers under them, which if left alone would eventually fill up. But luckily, ancient Romans were like the MacGyver's of piss. Emperor Vespasian was the first one to realize he was quite literally sitting on a liquid gold mine. He started sending people out to collect urine, which he got for free, and then sold it to a huge variety of workmen in the city. These workmen paid a tax for the use of the urine, which was easier than going out and rounding it all up themselves. photos.com Obviously. Wait, what? So just what did they do with it? Let's just say everyone in Rome must have been walking around smelling like a latrine: Tanners used it to soften leather, and it was especially practical in the laundry, where it was used to get togas that famous bright white. So the city stayed clean, everyone had nice clothes and the government took in lots of tax revenue. Everyone wins. Getty Finally, drunken urination pays off. When Vespasian's son pointed out (and rightly so) that this whole thing was utterly disgusting, the emperor supposedly held up a gold coin and said, ""It doesn't stink,"" meaning that money is money no matter where it comes from. Although if it had been in your toga too long it probably would have had a faint smell of piss. Via Wikimedia Commons Don't mock, yours is covered in ball sweat. For being such an awesome guy, Vespasian was rewarded by having his name applied to toilets all over Europe. No, seriously, the word for public toilets is ""vespasiennes"" in French, ""vespasiene"" in Romanian and ""vespasiani"" in Italian. So while Mel Brooks lied to us when he said toilets were named after Prince John, that same scenario really did happen in Italy. We think of people from the past as pretty lax when it comes to personal hygiene, and compared with today's ""Oh-my-God-it's-a-germ-kill-it!"" culture, that's probably a fair assessment. However, this wasn't necessarily through lack of knowledge about the benefits of being clean or the lack of desire. No, part of the reason people in England and France were so dirty for so long was the fact that buying soap was discouraged with heavy taxes, because the government decided bathing was the devil's pastime. Mostly because it is. Bathing regularly is something that has gone in and out of fashion over the past 2,000 years. While some queens happily boasted that they had bathed only twice in their lives, other people, like the ancient Britons and the odd ""eccentric"" aristocrat, thought that bathing at least once a week was good for you. The popularity of more regular baths was on the up again in England when King Charles I pissed off Parliament and got his head chopped off. His replacement was the ultrareligious, royalty and Christmas-hating, no-fun Puritan Oliver Cromwell, and it is thanks to him that the English went back to being filthy. The God-fearing Puritans thought being too clean was ungodly. All that smelling good and being naked and wet -- nothing good would come of it. So to discourage it, they slapped on a huge soap tax, like the massive taxes on cigarettes now. Although Cromwell initiated the tax, when the royal family was restored under Charles II, the king never bothered to change the law. After all, if people were willing to pay to be clean, the king might as well make some money off it. Via Wikimedia Commons Capes don't buy themselves. The tax was in place for 200 years and was taken so seriously that soap makers actually had representatives of the king watch them make all of their soap to ensure that none of it was being made in secret and sold on the black market. When this tax was finally repealed in England in the 1800s, the chancellor supposedly said, ""A clean nation is a happy nation,"" and clothes that you could wash regularly became all the rage. Of course, from that moment on, Britain became the nonstop hedonistic fuck orgy it is today. Russia pretty much sucked in 1697. Peter the Great, new to the throne and having that awesome name to live up to, had grand plans to modernize the country to catch up to the rest of the world. This led to some great things, such as the construction of St. Petersburg from the ground up. But he thought there was one major thing holding Russia back: istockphoto Beards. No one in Europe wore beards anymore. Russians, in their long facial hair, looked as ridiculous as someone walking around in 6-inch platform heels with goldfish swimming inside would look today. In an effort to modernize Russia and make it more European than Eastern, Peter the Great made men cut off their beards. And when we say he ""made"" them, we're talking a man who was known to attack bearded men in the street and forcefully shave them. But being a slightly reasonable giant psychopath, he also offered them the option of paying a ridiculously heavy tax to keep their long beards. That way, if they had to embarrass the motherland with their fashion faux pas, at least the czar made money off it (the fact that Peter himself couldn't grow a beard probably had nothing to do with his decision). Via Wikimedia Commons Honestly, if you let that guy beat you up, you kind of deserved it. This yearly tax was especially controversial because Russian Orthodoxy said that men needed to wear beards down to their chests. It wasn't just a suggestion, either. Ivan the Terrible once stated that ""to shave the beard is a sin the blood of all martyrs cannot cleanse,"" which to be fair is probably a little extreme on the pro-beard side. Via Wikimedia Commons But he could actually kick your ass, so there was that. Most men found that their love of money and fear of Peter outweighed their religious leanings and shaved. Those who had their beards chopped off saved them and were buried with them to prove (presumably to God) that they had wanted to do the right thing but couldn't (because really, who has that many kopecks to spend on divine facial hair?). Going to war isn't for everybody, as illustrated by the fact that all branches of the military are having a hard time reaching their recruitment quotas. Men even risked imprisonment by dodging the draft during the Vietnam War, figuring that sharing a cell with Stabby McGee was a far more enjoyable prospect than being shot at all day. istockphoto ""Uh ... guys, I think I'm just going to sit this one out if you don't mind."" But there was a time when you could get out of your fighting duties just by paying a tax. Called scutage, it was levied on knights who refused to go to war. See, back in the Dark Ages the entire point of a knight was to fight for his king. That's why many of them were rewarded for their service, built big houses, married an important guy's daughter and basically started living the (relatively) cushy life of an aristocrat. But then some king would remind you that you only got to live that way because you (or more likely your grandfather) had been a great soldier. Never mind if you had serfs and children to be looking after -- if a war started, you had to be there. Eventually, Henry II worked out that some knights were just not going to fight, or at least fight well, under this system and came up with an idea to let them pay a fine for being pansy asses afraid of a getting their heads chopped off in battle. This way the king could hire regular soldiers to fight for him who were much cheaper, enlarging his fighting force. For a while this worked quite well, even as the tax you had to pay to get out of fighting slowly got more expensive. Getty After a while, only a rare few could still afford it. Then things fell apart. King John of Robin Hood fame, not remembered by history as one of the great monarchs, raised the tax again. This might have been fine, but he even started charging men this tax in years where no wars occurred. Now, we can understand having to pay for being a coward, but having to pay because the king didn't feel like going to war that season? That seems a bit much. The barons thought so too, and scutage was one of the main issues brought up in the Magna Carta they made John sign. As ridiculous as we might think men in old portraits look wearing white curly wigs, for the rich, having a wig was a big deal back in the day. Fortunes were spent on buying them and keeping them nice. A lot of highway robbers weren't after the money or jewels people had, but the wigs, the most expensive thing they owned by far. They were so expensive that only the very rich could own one. So when the British government was looking for a way to fairly tax the rich more than the poor in the late 1700s, it decided to tax wigs and wig powder. Getty And we all know what happens to wigs without the powder. However, the plan backfired when almost overnight the number of people who wore wigs, or even just powdered their natural hair, plummeted. The high tax effectively ended the fashion for wigs. But the government had an ace up its sleeve: the hat tax. photos.com Oh, HELL no! By the time the wig tax was levied, wigs were already considered a bit uncool, and mostly older men wore them. But hats were very cool. Even poor men owned hats, while the rich might own several very expensive ones. Therefore, the tax depended on the price of the hat you were buying, and boy, was the increase steep. Every hat sold had to be from a licensed retailer (like with alcohol today) so that the government knew it was getting its tax money. If you were stopped in the street and had to prove you'd paid the tax, you simply showed a stamp on the inside of your hat. So unlike those mattress tags that say, ""Do not remove"" but you do anyway, no one would remove the paper tag inside his hat. photos.com While others never removed the actual hat. Anyone caught not paying the hat tax was heavily fined. But the government was seriously not fucking around when it came to getting its money out of this. Anyone caught forging the stamps that proved the tax had been paid faced the death penalty if convicted. Holy shit! photos.com And the forgeries weren't that hard to spot. Most of the items on this list are from the olden days, but don't worry -- creative taxation is something that won't go away until the last nation disappears from the earth. istockphoto.com Probably not Germany. For instance, obesity is becoming the plague of the modern world -- increased rates of diabetes and heart disease put a strain on health services, and those are strains that a lot of broke countries can't afford. So what to do if you and your neighbors let yourselves go a little too much? Tax you for it. The logical way to do this would be to increase taxes on fast food or sodas, but Japan went for a more literal approach and just straight-up taxes your extra inches. Getty Wait ... Japan? Literal? Isn't there something in the Bible about this? Despite not being famed for its big-boned population, Japan got ahead of the game by refusing to let its citizens go the way of America and the U.K. It has started measuring the waists of all of its citizens over the age of 40 which is about 44 percent of all the people in the country. Men and women with waists larger than 35.5 inches will be given information on healthier eating and lifestyles. If after a few months they have not lost enough weight, they will be fined by the government. Getty And possibly forced to ""stop doing crazy shit."" Technically, it isn't the individual being taxed. Companies and local councils are responsible for keeping their people in line, and in the end, they are the ones who actually pay the fine. And these aren't small fines, either; one company discovered it would be fined $19 million if none of its employees lost any weight. Since no company wants to lose money because of fat employees, the pressure to be slim is huge. Because that is obviously so much better for your stress level -- if you look like you're carrying a little extra weight, say goodbye to your job. Or maybe you suddenly find that all your neighbors are bullying you every time you so much as look at a dessert. Getty Fortunately, healthy options do come in Hello Kitty form.

"Many politicians envision themselves in an exalted roll and then act accordingly. Some imagine themselves as a benevolent father figure, others as a populist folk hero, but the most nausea-inducing usually see themselves as the savior of mankind. It has become very clear, particularly since she became Speaker of the House, that Nancy Pelosi sees herself as Mother Teresa, obligated by divine decree to take care of every American. The huge expansion of government during her Speakership revealed her self-ordained purpose in life, and, now that she is in the minority, she insists on protecting those Americans that she has taken under her wing. Last week Ms. Pelosi defended her flock in her inimitable style – throwing out alarming numbers that she pulled from her tookus. In a news conference on April 4, she claimed that the federal government pays for meal deliveries to 6 million seniors. She then asked if the middle ground in the budget discussion was delivery to 3 million seniors, ruefully adding “I don’t think so.” She may not have thought so because – again in her inimitable style – the numbers are utterly bogus. The Washington Post fact-checked the number and found that it is actually 2.6 million. But the question that should honestly be asked is whether these seniors really need Mother Pelosi to spend our money to hire government workers to feed our seniors? After listening to Mother Pelosi’s statement several times I began to wonder: What brought us to this point? How many seniors who are receiving these meals have no other means of getting them? How many of these people are truly destitute? Don’t any of them have local family members? Are there no local charities that sponsor a Meals on Wheels program? How much is this program really needed? Politicians today don’t ask these questions because harridans like Mother Pelosi start screaming about starving seniors, starving children, starving whatever. This has been the pattern for at least fifty years, but now we’ve hit the proverbial wall and we must finally start evaluating exactly how much government can or should be doing. The recession has laid bare the immense cost of government, and Americans finally understand that they can neither ask nor allow their governments to do everything. We have reached America’s critical moment. We must determine whether we want to become like Europeans – who have surrendered life decisions to government workers – or whether we want to maintain our individuality. Government now costs about 37% of our gross domestic product (GDP), including the 5% growth in federal spending under the Obama-Pelosi regime. This level of massive spending has driven the federal government, as well as many state and municipal governments, to a point of undeclared bankruptcy. Republicans want to bring it back to 32% (or less), and restore a policy of balanced budgets, fiscal sanity, and inter-generational sustainability. To Democrats, Europe is the guiding light. The 14 countries of Western European have, on the average, a governmental burden of 50.7% of GDP. These are preposterous, unsustainable numbers. Someone has to create the wealth that funds the government. While taxation of public employees is, in truth, just a reduction in their cost, every government needs a critical mass of private-sector enterprise and employment in order to function. When over half of everything you produce – and half of everything you earn – is confiscated, there will never be sufficient incentive to produce a vibrant, growing private sector, and, over a prolonged period, the entire societal and fiscal structure will collapse. That is why there have been riots across Europe. Government leaders have finally realized that their national treasuries are buckling under the weight of too many promises and not enough ability to perform nor incentive to produce. Unfortunately, the people – deluded by the false siren of cradle-to-grave socialism – perceive a world in which the State alleges to take care of all their needs, wants and desires. The Democrats’ only solution is to raise taxes on the “rich.” Even if they confiscated every dollar earned by the “rich,” we wouldn’t come close to balancing our budget. But you can be sure of one thing: if tax rates become outrageously high – and we should be clear that even now, combined tax rates for high earners are over 50% – these people will either take their ball and go home, or relocate elsewhere in this ever-shrinking world. Americans have vital decisions to make. Do we want the government to shovel our snow or can we do it ourselves? Do we want to feed our elderly parents and grandparents or are we going to shuffle that responsibility off to some nameless, faceless bureaucrat? Do we want to save for our own retirement or are we going to be entirely dependent on government bureaucrats to collect our money and hope that it’s there when we stop working? Mother Pelosi and her comrades think they should have all the money and dole it out as they see fit. They have a savior complex funded by OPM (other people’s money). But we ordinary Americans now understand that there is no honey pot at the end of the rainbow, and it is up to us to decide whether we are going to allow Mother Pelosi to continue this dangerous charade. .com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis.

"The Obama Administration’s call for greater taxes and “shared sacrifice” is hollow and morally bankrupt. President Obama wants to convince the nation that many Americans, most of them small business owners, must pay more tax as “their fair share” of huge, annual deficits. What Mr. Obama never mentions is that he has surrounded himself with key advisors and selected key members of his Administration that are tax cheats. Never before has an Administration been so wholly composed of senior officials that push so stridently for increasing taxes on Americans, while they avoid any personal responsibility for paying their own personal taxes. Seemingly, if you are a member of the Obama Administration, your “fair share” of the national tax burden is zero. Instead, taxes are an instrument of “shared sacrifice” to be loaded onto someone else. First some numbers. Some 41 different Senior Obama Administration Officials have been identified as tax cheats, owing over $840 million in back taxes. Many of Obama’s key officials that are responsible for the economy and have been given wide powers in tax policy are themselves, tax cheats and tax avoiders. The most notable of these is Timmy Geithner, Secretary of the Treasury and nominal head of the IRS, who utilized the “INTUIT TurboTax-is-not intuitive-I didn’t-realize-I was-supposed-to-pay-taxes” defense. Once exposed, Obama dismissed Geithner’s tax cheating, and had no problem with him heading the Treasury/IRS. In fact, Mr. Obama continued to stock his Administration with tax cheats and tax avoiders, seeing no contradiction in a advocating policies that call for ever greater taxes on other Americans, while so many of his own cabinet and key economic advisors have failed to pay. Hilda Solis, Secretary of Labor, used the “I’m-just-a-wife-how-can-I-be-held-responsible-for-knowing-what-my-husband-is-doing” defense, and after paying back taxes on the few years for which they were fingered, now heads the team shaping Obama’s labor taxes policies. Ron Kirk, Obama’s Trade representative, had tax problems, as did Kathleen Sibelius, current HHS Secretary, who leads the push for the Obamacare atrocity, and unabashedly calls for greater taxes and burdens on honest Americans to fund the dodgy scheme. There are also tax problems with the appointees at levels below the cabinet, such as Capricia Marshall (Chief of Protocol), with the “post-office-ate-my-tax return” defense or Lael Brainerd (Treasury Undersecretary). In addition to the individual tax cheats currently serving in the Obama administration, there have been a startling number of nominees who have withdrawn their nomination after being publicly exposed as having tax and other issues. A quick review includes Tom Daschle (HHS Nominee), Nancy Killefer (OMB nominee), Bill Richardson, and Caroline Atkinson (Treasury-International Affairs), just to name a few. Some of the Obama appointees’ tax problems may not have been as despicable as others, but just look at the number of them. Has any previous Administration been so infested with tax cheats? Nor does President Obama seem to think tax cheating and tax avoidance are detriments to public service for he continues to select nominees that are similarly “tax challenged”. Jeffrey Immelt, CEO of General Electric was selected by Obama to lead his Counsel on Jobs and Competitiveness this past January. Immelt has boasted of GE’s staggering $14.2 billion in profits and that it paid no taxes. Yet, Immelt feels right at home pushing the Obama line that other Americans need to pay more in taxes to fund the bloated government that Obama has added. The Obama Administration seems to be filled with so many tax cheats and tax avoiders that it has surrendered any credibility on the issue of increasing taxes. President Obama remains undeterred by the poor example set by his own Administration and brazenly announced that “we are beginning to crack down on Americans who are bending or breaking the rules, and we're helping to ensure that all Americans are contributing their fair share—and not let some citizens and businesses dodge their tax responsibility, while ordinary Americans pick up the slack.” Fine words, but what the President did not mention is that his Administration sets a terrible example and is most in need of a “crack down”. Indeed, recent reports estimate the full amount of taxes owed by all members of the Obama Administration is over $3 billion. Americans are saddled with the sad example of a President that seems to feel no reluctance in calling on others to pay more taxes, even as his own Administration is increasingly composed of tax cheats. Nor is the President deterred in the use of increasingly hostile rhetoric used to describe honest opponents (most of whom do pay their annual taxes), questioning their patriotism, fairness, and compassion. Obama’s tax policy seems aimed at protecting his own loyalists and pushing responsibility for taxes onto others. One thing is clear: Obama can always count on folks who don’t pay their taxes to support higher taxes for others because it sure seems they know they won’t have to pay. If Obama wants to restore his credibility in the debate on taxes, he should first get rid of the many close advisors that have cheated on their taxes, and require all those serving in his Administration to pay what they owe. Until he does so, the strange and tortured logic that President Obama uses to push for other Americans to pay “their fair share” must be rejected. Put simply, the Obama Administration has no credibility to talk about tax policy, much less make any moral argument about who should be paying more. .com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis.

Earlier: Wake Up, America: Demographic Replacement Means Statue Replacement—And Our Elimination From History My ancestors were Presbyterian abolitionists who fought on the Union side, but I get really ticked off when imbeciles take a sledgehammer to my country’s history. Last week, with self-satisfied glee, savages tore down the 14-foot statue of Robert E. Lee designed by the French sculptor Antonin Mercie and installed in 1890 on land deeded to the state—in return for a promise that the Commonwealth of Virginia “will hold said Statue and pedestal and Circle of ground perpetually sacred to the Monumental purpose to which they have been devoted and that she will faithfully guard it and affectionately protect it.” But Virginia’s supreme court ruled that the state had a “free speech” right to violate the deed. On that theory, no contract can ever be enforced. I have a free speech right to say that I will NOT deliver 20 pounds of bananas! It’s not just “Southerners” who revere Lee, as his Wikipedia page implies. Franklin Delano Roosevelt called Lee “one of our greatest American Christians and one of our greatest American gentlemen.” Dwight Eisenhower said Lee was “noble as a leader and as a man, and unsullied as I read the pages of our history.” Even Ulysses S. Grant called him “the acknowledged ablest general in the Confederate army.” The son—not grandson—of a hero of the American Revolution, Lee graduated second in his class at West Point, then distinguished himself in the Mexican-American War. Lee’s reputation was so great that President Lincoln asked him to take command of the Union forces against the South. But Lee was a Virginian and felt compelled to take Virginia’s side, so he resigned from the U.S. Army. Believe it or not, as Ripley used to say, Communist theoretician Karl Marx anticipated a key economic argument against mass immigration that .com has made since its beginning: Unfettered immigration depresses wages for host-nation workers. That Marx was wrong in his overall critique of capitalism, most notably his prediction that it was doomed, did not make him wrong on everything. On immigration, Marx was on the right side of the debate, if not necessarily for the right reasons. Oddly, America’s resurgent Communists don’t seem to have noticed. Consider a letter of 1870 to Sigfrid Meyer and August Vogt, German friends in the United States. Citing the effects of large-scale Irish immigration upon England, Marx explained the destabilizing effect of cheap immigrant labor: “Owing to the constantly increasing concentration of leaseholds, Ireland constantly sends her own surplus to the English labor market, and thus forces down wages and lowers the material and moral position of the English working class,” the primordial Prussian Communist wrote [Marx to Sigfrid Meyer and August Vogt, Marxists.org, April 9, 1870]. That isn’t all he wrote on the subject, but that little gem suggests that Marx understood at least something about supply and demand, and wages, labor, and immigration. Mass immigration depressed 19th-century British wages just as it depresses American wages today. A little history: During the second half of the 19th century, the “Irish question” weighed heavily on English minds. Many Irish boarded ships for the short trip to England. Ireland was part of the United Kingdom, which had open borders for all its subjects. Even after 1921, residents of the “Irish Free State” did not need a passport or visa to enter the U.K. See also: Leftist Paige Harden's Genetics: Taking the Fun Out of Being ""Progressive"" I have written before about the concept of the “Bravery Signaler.” In our increasingly authoritarian and anti-science world, “Bravery Signalers” occupy a very specific—and financially profitable—niche. They question Woke dogmas—such as that genetics is irrelevant—but they don’t go “too far.” They are careful to ignore, or fallaciously critique, research which is simply too “out there” for “respectable” people. Thus they get all the benefits of being “brave” and “edgy,” yet they won’t quite get “canceled.” They’ll receive nasty reactions from Leftist anti-scientists, but these won’t be extreme enough to be career-ending. A recent article in The New Yorker [Can Progressives Be Convinced That Genetics Matters? by Gideon Lewis-Kraus, September 6, 2021], reports that what might be called the “Boadicea of Bravery-Signaling” has emerged. Her name: Dr. Kathryn Paige Harden. The tediously lengthy article sets out how Paige, now a social psychologist at the University of Texas at Austin, grew up in a conservative Christian home and was educated at conservative colleges, at her parents’ insistence, before going to the University of Virginia, where her PhD was supervised by Jewish Leftist geneticist Eric Turkheimer. In 2017, Harden joined Turkheimer and social psychologist Richard E. Nisbett in co-authoring a savagely-headlined Vox article that purported to refute The Bell Curve’s arguments that race and class differences in socioeconomic outcomes in the US are likely to be significantly genetic. (She later distanced herself from what Steve Sailer has called “Turkheimer’s but-is-it-good-for-the-Jews extremism”). The New Yorker paints Harden as something of “Head Girl” type, a term coined by British psychologist Bruce Charlton: the chief prefect at British girls’ schools who is intelligent, hard-working, popular, and who diligently works for socially acceptable ends [The Head Girl Syndrome—the Opposite of a Creative Genius, by Bruce Charlton, Intelligence, Personality and Genius, July 25, 2013]. Except, Harden has a bit of an edge to her; she’s prepared to be a bit “controversial.” As the voice of the Historic American Nation, .com is proud to announce the creation of a print journal featuring the best material from our webzine.

"Follow Us National Review Justice Breyer Brushes Off Retirement Demands, But Says He Doesn’t ‘Intend to Die on the Court’ Sanders Rebukes Manchin’s Downsized Ceiling for Reconciliation Bill This Day in Liberal Judicial Activism—September 12 The Supreme Court in the American Constitutional Order The Myth of the Red Pill Your average poorly informed lefty (but I repeat myself) will reliably tell you that our current fiscal straits are the result of three things: 1. Bush’s wars; 2. Bush’s tax cuts for the rich; 3. Bush’s bank bailouts. That is not true, of course: The main bank bailouts (odious as they were) have been paid back, often at a profit. The money-losing parts (and the likely money-losing parts) are the ones insisted upon by Barack Obama and his Democratic colleagues: the foreclosure-prevention programs, the endless maintenance of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, etc. The Iraq War, in its most expensive year, cost $140 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Its total cost over the years is estimated at about $700 billion — a good deal less spending than, say, Obama’s stimulus package. It is not, and has not been, an exceptionally large driver of our deficit spending. Our deficit is running around $1.6 trillion. If we took all military spending — not just the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, but the whole shebang — and cut it to $0.00, we’d save about $664 billion a year. Iraq and Afghanistan will cost about $170 billion combined in FY2011. Ending the Bush tax cuts for “the rich” — for the $250,000-and-up crowd, in Obama’s formulation — would put on average about another $80 billion a year into Treasury coffers. (CBO estimates the ten-year cost of those tax cuts at $800 billion.) The spending on the wars and the forgone revenue from the Bush tax cuts do not add up to much of that $1.6 trillion deficit: a little less than 16 percent. The tax cuts for the unrich were a good deal more expensive, which is why Obama’s rhetoric on the tax cuts sort of makes my head hurt: The president says he agreed to tax cuts for “the rich” only to preserve tax cuts for “the middle class” — which is to say, he agreed to a mere $800 billion in tax cuts that he didn’t want in order to preserve a considerable $2.2 trillion in tax cuts that he did want — and then argues that our problem is too many tax cuts, two-thirds of which he was so intent on keeping that he took the other third, too. But even that $2.2 trillion over ten years would not make much of a dent in our $1.6 trillion annual deficit. And just who are these “rich”? Under Obama’s arbitrary, politically minded cutoffs ($200,000 for an individual, $250,000 for a couple), a public-school administrator earning $130,000 a year married to a pharmacist earning $125,000 a year and raising four kids is rhetorically lumped in with “millionaires and billionaires,” as the president put it, and desperately in need of a tax hike — but a single guy earning $198,000 a year is in the middle class, and his $2.2 trillion in tax cuts must be protected. Definitional quibbles aside, the war spending and the Bush tax cuts don’t add up to a whole lot in the context of the $1.6 trillion deficit. What does? The Department of Health and Human Services will see more than $900 billion in outlays in FY2011. About $83 billion of that is discretionary spending on things like the Centers for Disease Control. Almost all of the rest is Medicare and Medicaid — the two programs that President Obama has vowed to shield from substantial reform of the sort envisioned by Rep. Paul Ryan. The other big driver of spending, as the president himself acknowledged yesterday, is Social Security, meaningful reform of which he also promises to resist. Obama’s big plan for the health-care entitlements is appointing a committee, called the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB). This committee will be composed of experts. (Really.) And they will, the president promises, expertly discover ways to reduce Medicare spending. At the end of that sentence is an invisible asterisk: The committee is forbidden to change anything about the structure of Medicare, to increase premiums, to change cost-sharing arrangements, etc. It is also forbidden, on paper, to ration care. That is because it does not need to ration care: What it can do is cut payments to doctors, pharmacies, hospitals, etc., which simply pushes the dirty work of rationing and denying care off on them. If it costs X to provide a particular service, and IPAB sets the price at <X, that service will not be available to Medicare patients. And Medicare recipients can all thank the heavens that their health care is not being “rationed” as products, services, and procedures simply disappear from the menu. We have tried a similar approach before, with legislation that requires cuts in Medicare reimbursement rates. Congress simply votes to suspend the law when the cuts come due. Congress can vote to ignore IPAB’s cuts, too, though it is procedurally harder to do. None of which matters very much in the context of a $1.6 trillion deficit and a $14 trillion–plus national debt. Current CBO estimates of the savings to be realized from IPAB range from a high of $28 billion over ten years to a low of $0.00 over the same period of time. If IPAB performs to perfection — if it performs twice as well as CBO expects — it still will not make much of a dent in things. A study from Credit Suisse puts the net value of all the financial assets in the world (excluding real estate) at about $80 trillion ($117 trillion in financial assets minus $37 trillion in household debt). Our unfunded entitlement liabilities are about $100 trillion. Given that they exceed world financial wealth, I suspect that those liabilities are not going to be met. Crazy hunch I have. As I have argued before, what we are really negotiating about at this point is not how we are going to go about paying for these things, but how we are going to go about not paying for these things. Paul Ryan’s plan for Medicare is to let Americans shop for health-care coverage and then have the government pay the first $15,000 in premiums — a reasonably generous deal. (And even more generous for the very poor.) That premium support would grow relatively slowly, putting pressure on both consumers and providers of health-care to reduce costs. This is eminently sensible — critical, in fact: The reason that cellphones and computers don’t cost $10,000 isn’t that Motorola and Apple love us: It’s that consumers spending their own money are cost-conscious, so everybody has to compete on both price and quality. The only important products in the United States that do not get better and cheaper every year are K–12 education and health care, which are about 97 percent and 55 percent dominated by the government, respectively, and therefore have little consumer-price pressure. Obama’s alternative is another magical committee of wise men, no doubt drawn from the same stale bowl of political Froot Loops from which he spooned up his various czars and advisers, from Marxist nut cutlet Van Jones to tax-dodging Treasury boss Tim Geithner. Markets aren’t perfect, but I trust consumers to make their own decisions better than I trust Obama and these jokers to make them on our behalf. Either way, cuts are coming, and the main question now is what shape they will take and who gets to make the final choice about health-care decisions: consumers and providers, or Obama and his experts. — Kevin D.

"Have you noticed all the huge antiwar demonstrations in the last twelve months? Yeah, me neither. It turns out that a lot of the energy for the movement seems to have been provided by Democrats who are a lot less worried about wars conducted by Democratic presidents. Or at least who believe that advancing the Democratic agenda is much more important than trying to end the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. This is by no means the whole movement--but it was enough that once a Democrat took office, both the numbers at the demonstrations, and the organizational capacity of the movement as a whole, dwindled away to near-nothingness. ""That's how you know that the cause has actually become a movement,"" he said. ""You look around and see a lot of new faces. It's no longer just the usual suspects."" What H&R describe in their paper is, in effect, the film running in reverse. Beyond a certain point, fragmentation becomes self-reinforcing. I wondered about the implications of H&R's work for what now remains the antiwar movement. Was there anything in their analysis that would suggest the possibility of its revival, on a broader basis, in the immediate future? Could it happen with Obama still in office? Or would it take the ""perceived threat"" of a Republican president? I wrote Heaney to ask. His short answer was, simply, no -- the chances of a major revival in the short term are slim. The more nuanced version of his response went somewhat beyond my question, though, and seems of interest: ""As long as voters remain highly polarized along party lines,"" he responded by e-mail, ""self-identified Democrats are unlikely to protest against Obama's policies, even if they disagree with some of them strongly. A sudden end to the era of partisan polarization seems highly unlikely. So I would say that it is a very good bet that Obama will not confront large left-wing demonstrations. Of course, LBJ faced large left-wing demonstrations, but the party system was not polarized back then in the way that it is today."" The same dynamics apply to the Tea Party: ""Our analysis implies that the Tea Party will have a lower degree of organization and success in 2012 than it did in 2010. Because the Republicans won the House and made gains in the Senate, Tea Party activists feel much less threatened today than they did a year ago. So, while the Tea Party will obviously be around in 2012 -- and it will likely factor into the Republican presidential contest -- our analysis suggests that the Tea Party will not generate the same level of enthusiasm next year as it did last year."""
"Gary Coronado, Christy Bowe/Zuma It’s tempting to dismiss Donald Trump’s attempt at an unfriendly takeover of the GOP’s 2012 presidential contest as a novelty act. But Mitt Romney ought to be worried—very worried. Not because Trump will be able to snatch the Republican nomination. Unless the bankruptcy-prone celebrity developer can totally rewrite the laws of politics, he will remain a longshot—snake eyes or box cars, take your pick. His obsession with Obama’s birth records has marginalized him straight out of the gate, generating an all-hair-and-no-cattle rep (though Sarah Palin, appropriately enough, is defending him). With his fact-free embrace of birtherism, Trump may be earning trash-talking points among the GOP electorate’s die-hard Obama haters. Still, Trump has problems with the overlapping constituencies of the right. Social conservatives will surely be suspicious of the thrice-married playboy’s flip-flops on abortion and gay rights. And tea partiers will hardly cheer his past support of single-payer national insurance and a 14.25 percent tax surcharge on the wealthy. Yet even if his M&A effort is a deal too far, Trump remains a torpedo pointed straight at Romney. The bad-boy businessman took an opening shot at the former Massachusetts governor last weekend on CNN: Well, Mitt Romney is a basically small business guy, if you really think about it. He was a hedge fund. He was a fund guy. He walked away with some money from a very good company that he didn’t create. He worked there. He didn’t create… Well, but, look, he would buy companies, he’d close companies, he’d get rid of jobs… I’m a much bigger businessman. I mean, my net worth is many, many, many times Mitt Romney. Put aside the mine-is-bigger-than-his braggadocio. Trump, despite his initial buffoonery, has the standing to challenge Romney’s core narrative: I’m a business guy who can save the American economy. After all, Trump’s criticism of Romney is solid. Romney was CEO of Bain Capital, which bought and sold dozens of companies, often merging or downsizing firms and selling off assets, which led to job losses. As the Boston Globe noted in 2008, “a review of Bain’s investments during Romney’s tenure indicates that job growth was not a particular priority.” As Romney campaigns to be CEO of the USA, his conventional GOP opponents—Tim Pawlenty, Haley Barbour, and the others—can be expected to question his claim that he’s the best choice to revive the American economy. But they’ll be doing so as politicians, without much personal history to back up their charges. Trump, despite a past that includes a string of failed deals (he lost money in the casino business?), will be confronting Romney as a tycoon: businessmano-a-businessmano. This will add a great deal of sting to his lashing of Romney. If Trump says Romney is a corporate parasite and no master of The Art of the Deal, it will mean much more than Rick Santorum bleating the same point. And there’s this: Trump can take the anti-Romney argument to more corners of the media than the traditional 2012 contestants. For the next eight or so months, the GOP presidential race will transpire on a relatively narrow media field: on cable TV news and the political pages of newspapers and websites—the usual spots. Trump the Celebrity transcends these confines. If he throws his hair into the ring, he will draw media attention that extends beyond the politerati. That means that when he’s blasting the front-runner as a buy-’em-and-bleed-’em empty suit, this anti-Romney message will resound in media that reaches less-politically minded people—that is, voters who don’t engage deeply during the primary season but who vote in the general election. People magazine, The View, whatever—Trump has more access to non-political information highways than the rest of the pack. Palin might be able to give Trump a run for his money in this regard, but the former half-term governor will hardly be as effective a critic of Romney’s business background as Trump. If Trump decides to take the anti-Romney banner into battle, he will get plenty of attention for it. He’ll put it up in bright lights in Times Square. One thing that Trump excels at is getting attention. Trump has added both drama and comic relief to the Republicans’ So You Wanna Be President? reality show—which may be good for ratings, his ratings. At a time when the US economy is fragile and the nation, engaged in three military actions, is deep in a debate over deficits and the role of government, Trump could have focused his initial presidential exploration on economic policy matters; instead, he went straight for the crazy with birtherism. “People love this issue especially in the Republican Party,” he said recently, displaying his sense of priorities. That may make Trump seem like a joke, but Romney ought not be laughing. Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

"Political Byline This blog is no longer active as of October 31, 2011 Posted onApril 23, 2011April 23, 2011AuthorPatrick5 Comments These are Obama’s people… The shocking video: The Story via the Baltimore Sun: A video of a vicious beating at a Baltimore County McDonald’s restaurant went viral Friday, garnering hundreds of thousands of views on websites and prompting the fast-food giant to issue a statement condemning the incident. The video shows two women — one of them a 14-year-old girl — repeatedly kicking and punching the 22-year-old victim in the head, as an employee of the Rosedale restaurant and a patron try to intervene. Others can be heard laughing, and men are seen standing idly by. Toward the end of the video, one of the suspects lands a punishing blow to the victim’s head, and she appears to have a seizure. A man’s voice tells the women to run because police are coming. The three-minute clip was apparently first posted on YouTube, then taken down by administrators who said it violated the site’s policies. But it popped back up on other sites and was ultimately linked from the popular Drudge Report, which gave it top billing for much of the day. So, why’d these two beat this woman? Quote: Equality Maryland said the victim is a transgender woman and called on state Attorney General Douglas F. Gansler to step in and investigate the case as a hate crime. Police and prosecutors said they did not know whether the victim is a transgender woman. “It does appear that the victim was a transgender woman, and she was brutalized while people stood by and watched,” said Lisa Polyak, vice president of the board of directors for Equality Maryland, an advocacy organization that fought unsuccessfully in the past legislative session for greater protections for transgender individuals. “There’s no excuse for that violence under any circumstances, but we would encourage police to investigate as a hate crime.” The police report does not provide a motive, but quotes one of the suspects saying that the fight was “over using a bathroom.” Oh, so because she’s a “Chick with a dick” that makes this sort of a crime just fine right? Wrong. Hate Crimes are hate crimes; no matter whom is doing it or who it is happening too. You ask, “Why did you bring the race issue into it?” Because quite frankly, the damned liberal media will not report on black on white crime; so, I guess it is we blogger’s job to do that, is it not? Not only that, but I feel, when you do a crime like this; not only do you own the fact that you did the crime —– you own your race as well. Just like a white man or woman would if they committed a crime like this to black man or woman. That is my entire bitch with the liberal black community; they will never, ever, own their racial crimes and racist attitudes towards whites. But they sure as hell want we White people to own ours. Just like Jews, Jews can be bigoted toward we White Aryan people all they wish; but the minute we Aryans say an critical word about a Jew, we get plowed for it. Again, it is that double standard in this Country. It is wrong, it began with Progressivism back in the 1940’s and it needs to change. Others: The Smoking Gun, Pajamas Media, The Other McCain, The Lonely Conservative, iOwnTheWorld.com, JONATHAN TURLEY, The Gateway Pundit and UrbanGrounds Update: Oh my…. I got into the racist issue, a whole bunch, but UrbanGrounds, he went for the jugular!: and this is what Black Culture in America has become. And make no doubt, that it is different from anything even remotely resembling American Culture (which is shared by all races, to include some blacks who have not fallen victim to this thug culture). I can’t tell you how sick this video makes me. Not just the two piece-of-shit niggers beating on that helpless woman (NOTE: Nigger is not a word I use lightly or frequently. But make no doubt about it — the two pieces-of-shit women animals attacking this woman are indeed worthless niggers) — but I’m almost more appalled by their “brothers” and “sisters” who are standing around, not helping — many of them laughing and videoing the attack — while a helpless white woman is nearly beaten to death. Even the black male McDonald’s employees only half-heatedly attempt to help their customer. The only person within any sense of humanity in the entire store? An old white woman who puts herself in harms way to protect the woman from being dragged outside, where the two niggers likely would have killed her. Note at the end of the video where the man who is video taping it repeatedly warns the two thug attackers that they better leave before the police arrive. A decent human (which he clearly is not) would have done everything humanly possible to make sure they were detained until the police did arrive. I can only hope that the police catch these two women, and that they resist arrest, and are both shot to death as a result, freeing the tax payers from having to try and incarcerate two worthless piles of shit that are lower than any animal I can think of. You know why you never see videos like this with a bunch of white people in it? Because most white men would have stopped the attack from happening. I would have beat both of those niggers unconscious if I had to. And if that didn’t work…well, then I’m sure my .45 ACP that I carry everywhere would have done the job. The biggest cancer in all of America is modern black culture, which condones, promotes and revels in this kind of violence. I can see his point and such…..but, I would not have used the whole N-Word thing. But the rest is right on point. The sad part is, Democrats foster that sort of culture.

It has lasted 30 years so far and claimed more than 25 million victims. It has cost almost as many lives as the Vietnam War. It determined the result of last year’s congressional election. Yet the American news media do not want to talk about the Dirty War, which remains between the lines and unreported. In fact, to even suggest that the war exists is to be discredited. So let’s start suggesting, immediately. No matter how crime figures are massaged by those who want to acknowledge or dispute the existence of a Dirty War, there is nothing ambiguous about what the official statistics portray: for the past 30 years a large segment of black America has waged a war of violent retribution against white America. And the problem is getting worse, not better. In the past 20 years, violent crime has increased more than four times faster than the population. Young blacks (under 18) are more violent than previous generations and are 12 times more likely to be arrested for murder than young whites. Nearly all the following figures, which speak for themselves, have not been reported in America: • According to the latest US Department of Justice survey of crime victims, more than 6.6 million violent crimes (murder, rape, assault and robbery) are committed in the US each year, of which about 20 per cent, or 1.3 million, are inter-racial crimes. • Most victims of race crime—about 90 per cent—are white, according to the survey “Highlights from 20 Years of Surveying Crime Victims”, published in 1993. • Almost 1 million white Americans were murdered, robbed, assaulted or raped by black Americans in 1992, compared with about 132,000 blacks who were murdered, robbed, assaulted or raped by whites, according to the same survey. • Blacks thus committed 7.5 times more violent inter-racial crimes than whites even though the black population is only one-seventh the size of the white population. When these figures are adjusted on a per capita basis, they reveal an extraordinary disparity: blacks are committing more than 50 times the number of violent racial crimes of whites. • According to the latest annual report on murder by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, most inter-racial murders involve black assailants and white victims, with blacks murdering whites at 18 times the rate that whites murder blacks. These breathtaking disparities began to emerge in the mid-1960’s, when there was a sharp increase in black crime against whites, an upsurge which, not coincidentally, corresponds exactly with the beginning of the modern civil rights movement. Over time, the cumulative effect has been staggering. Justice Department and FBI statistics indicate that between 1964 and 1994 more than 25 million violent inter-racial crimes were committed, overwhelmingly involving black offenders and white victims, and more than 45,000 people were killed in inter-racial murders. By comparisons 58,000 Americans died in Vietnam, and 34,000 were killed in the Korean war. When non-violent crimes (burglary, larceny, car theft and personal theft) are included, the cumulative totals become prodigious. The Bureau of Justice Statistics says 27 million non-violent crimes were committed in the US in 1992, and the survey found that 31 per cent of the robberies involved black offenders and white victims (while only 2 per cent in the reverse). When all the crime figures are calculated, it appears that black Americans have committed at least 170 million crimes against white Americans in the past 30 years. It is the great defining disaster of American life and American ideals since World War II. All these are facts, yet by simply writing this story, by assembling the facts in this way, I would be deemed a racist by the American news media. It prefers to maintain a paternalistic double-standard in its coverage of black America, a lower standard.  Thanks for that, there are some, that would say that this is nothing more than hate. But I do know better. It is very true. Again, Thank you. -Pat Comments are closed."
"Photo Gallery: The Rare Republican Environmentalist Over the course of his long career as a Republican, a businessman and a governmental adviser, William K. Reilly has seen a lot. But during a recent trip to Berlin, the 71-year-old told  he finds Germany's evolving national energy policy ""breathtaking."" Reilly recently led a delegation of senior US officials on a two-day trip to Germany. The officials were members of the board of trustees of Duke University's Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions -- and they were interested in getting a close-up look at energy policies being implemented by Chancellor Angela Merkel's government. The trip happened to fall right in the middle of Merkel's radical energy-policy about-face precipitated by the nuclear catastrophe in Fukushima. To their amazement, the American visitors found officials in the inner core of Germany's conservative government who the Republicans back home would have dismissed as ""eco nuts."" Republicans in the US show no mercy when it comes to environmental issues. They refer to climate change as the ""big swindle"" and some of them view efforts to increase high-speed train service as a way of decreasing automobile traffic as ""socialist."" What's more, most of them would like to see the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) dissolved. They would likely refer to German Environment Minister Norber Röttgen, a member of Merkel's conservative Christian Democrats, as a ""liberal weirdo"" for his embrace of ecological principles, loose though it may be by German standards. Reilly, though, no longer holds political office in Washington. And he is a rarity among Republicans. During the Nixon administration, Reilly joined the staff of the President's Council on Environmental Quality before going on to head the World Wildlife Federation (WWF). When severe heat and widespread air pollution became major issues in the 1988 presidential election, George H.W. Bush, its eventual winner, appointed Reilly to lead the EPA. 'On the Right Track' At the time, Bush Sr. tried to present himself as ""the environmental president,"" a shocking strategy for a Republican. His predecessor Ronald Reagan, likewise a Republican, is memorable for quips such as ""A tree's a tree. How many more do you need to look at?"" and ""Trees cause more pollution than automobiles do."" But Reilly and Bush Sr. succeeded in toughening the regulations of the Clean Air Act, the effects of which are still felt today. Now, Reilly is a private-sector businessman. But environmental issues have remained close to his heart. In June 2010, President Barack Obama appointed him to be the conservative co-chair of the commission charged with investigating the BP Deepwater Horizon oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. Though he sits on the board of directors of ConocoPhillips, he continues to denounce the lax culture of oil firms when it comes to protecting the environment. In Berlin, Reilly and his delegation met with industry representatives, environmentalist groups, senior civil servants and Klaus Töpfer, the former environment minister who has been appointed to lead the so-called ""Ethics Commission"" tasked with studying the future of nuclear power in Germany. Given the degree of polarization surrounding the climate debate in the United States, the American visitors were amazed at what they heard. From the American perspective, Reilly thinks that it is ""almost incredible"" that the nuclear reactor accident in Fukushima would lead a conservative government to bid farewell to nuclear power while simultaneously trying to reduce the use of coal. He also thinks it will be hard to explain to his Republican friends on Capitol Hill. But he says he will try. Reilly, after all, in contrast to those international observers who have criticized Merkel's about-face as being hurried and emotionally driven, is impressed. He is, to be sure, critical of the high subsidies on offer for renewable energies. And he believes Germany won't be able to abandon nuclear energy without increasing its natural gas imports from Russia. But, he says, Germany ""is on the right track."" 'The Party of Sound Science' In the United States, Reilly has gotten used to being part of an absolute minority in terms of his environmental views. In Germany, he finally feels understood. ""It would be of great service for the whole world if Germany, as a successful and large economy, shows that it can increase wealth through renewable energies,"" he says. Were Germany successful, he believes it might impress the Americans and perhaps even lead to a change of heart. Still, he does not believe that such a change of heart will take place in the near future. Unlike in Germany, he says, most Americans believe that the most pressing environmental problems are polluted rivers and smog -- and that these problems were already solved in the 1970s. It is a viewpoint, he adds, that is as wrong as it is widespread. Reilly also finds it disappointing that his fellow Republicans have shown so little respect for climate research. ""Traditionally,"" he explains, ""the Republicans cast themselves as the party of sound science, whereas we portrayed Democrats as the party of emotionalism."" Under these circumstances, he finds it ""shocking"" that there is so ""little regard in the Republican party for the fact that 11 national academies of science have issued a strong warning"" about the dangers of man-made climate change. Keeping the Faith Still, Reilly has not given up hope, and he even says his trip to Germany has made him more optimistic. If Germany's conservatives have succeeded in embracing environmental protection, he asks, why can't it happen with his fellow Republicans? ""American politics can turn on a dime,"" he says. ""If our economy woes become smaller and we then face an extreme climatic event like a national draught, things might change."" Reilly points out that his old boss, President George H.W. Bush, even gained some political capital by pledging to be an environmental president. ""He demonstrated how to steal the environmental issue away from the Democrats,"" he says, adding: ""I'm still hopeful that there will again be a Republican president who calls himself an environmentalist."" +-Zugang wird gerade auf einem anderen Gerät genutzt + kann nur auf einem Gerät zur selben Zeit genutzt werden. Klicken Sie auf den Button, spielen wir den Hinweis auf dem anderen Gerät aus und Sie können + weiter nutzen. In the wake of the Fukushima disaster, Germany's conservative government has decided not to try to extend the lives of the country's nuclear reactors but, instead, to hasten efforts to have renewable resources supply a greater portion of the energy mix. Former Republican official William K. Reilly recently led a group from an American environmental institute to Germany to see how it is embracing alternative energy sources. Having led the World Wildlife Foundation and the Environmental Protection Agency, Reilly is a rare voice for environmental protection among American Republicans. Reilly sits with George H.W. Bush in 1992. When he entered into office, Bush Sr. pledged to be an environmental president. Reilly and Bush Sr. succeeded in toughening the regulations of the Clean Air Act. ""He demonstrated how to steal the environmental issue away from the Democrats,"" Reilly says. German Chancellor Angela Merkel (right) stands with Klaus Töpfer, the former environment minister who has been appointed to lead the so-called ""Ethics Commission"" tasked with studying the future of nuclear power in Germany. Reilly says that it ""would be of great service for the whole world if Germany, as a successful and large economy, shows that it can increase wealth through renewable energies."" If it succeeded in doing so, he believes that it would also impress the Americans and perhaps even lead to a change of heart on environmental matters. Merkel with German Environment Minister Norbert Röttgen. Many international observers have criticized Merkel's about-face as overly hurried and driven primarily from an emotional response. But Reilly finds the new German course very attractive."
"By Robert Roy Britt 13 March 2006 If you can't remember the headline of this article or are already struggling to recall some of the words at the beginning of the story, try hard to recall how much pot you smoked in your youth. A new study finds those who've used a lot of marijuana have worse memories and don't think as quickly. It's not the first study to suggest pot hurts memory, but the findings are stark. In one memory test, long-time uses remembered seven of 15 words, on average. Non-users remembered 12 of 15. On a decision-making test, those who had rarely smoked pot had impaired performance 8 percent of time, while long-term tokers had 70 percent impairment. The results are detailed in the March 14 issue of the journal Neurology. The study involved 64 people age 17 to 49 selected from a larger study group. They were split into three groups: those who had smoked four or more joints per week for more than 10 years; those who'd been smoking for five to 10 years; and those who had smoked at least once but not more than 20 times and not at all in the past two years. The middle group consistently scored in between the other two. ""We found that the longer people used marijuana, the more deterioration they had in these cognitive abilities, especially in the ability to learn and remember new information,"" said Lambros Messinis of the Department of Neurology at the University Hospital of Patras in Patras, Greece. A separate study in Neurology last year found higher blood flow velocity in the marijuana users even a month after they stopped smoking. Researchers said the change could help explain other studies that have revealed memory problems in pot smokers. A Harvard Medical School study in 2003 found lasting memory impairment in people who had started smoking marijuana before age 17, when the brain is still forming. And research published in November indicated that heavy marijuana use might put adolescents who are genetically predisposed to schizophrenia at greater risk of developing the brain disorder. Some 3.1 million Americans age 12 and older use marijuana daily or almost daily, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. In 2004, 5.6 percent of 12th graders reported daily use of marijuana. Stay up to date on the latest science news by signing up for our Essentials newsletter. Thank you for signing up to Live Science.

"Political Byline This blog is no longer active as of October 31, 2011 Posted onApril 24, 2011April 24, 2011AuthorPatrick5 Comments Remember the White Transgendered woman who was savagely beaten by the two black female thugs? Well, She is speaking out. The Video: “They said, ‘That’s a dude, that’s a dude and she’s in the female bathroom,’ ” said Chrissy Lee Polis, 22, who said she stopped at the Rosedale restaurant to use the restroom. “They spit in my face.” A worker at the restaurant taped Monday’s attack and created a graphic video that went viral last week. After the video garnered hundreds of thousands of views on websites, McDonald’s issued a statement condemning the incident, and on Saturday the worker who taped the incident was fired. The video shows two females — one of them a 14-year-old girl — repeatedly kicking and punching Polis in the head as an employee and a patron try to intervene. Others can be heard laughing, and men are seen standing idly by. Toward the end of the video, one of the suspects lands a punishing blow to the victim’s head, and Polis appears to have a seizure. A man’s voice tells the women to run because police are coming. “I knew they were taping me; I told the guy to stop,” said Polis, a resident of Baltimore. “They didn’t help me. They didn’t do nothing for me.” Of course, the dumb ass liberals are missing the point of this attack, as usual: Polis, who is white, believes race may have also been a factor in her attack— both the assailants were black, according to the police report. Of course, Pam couldn’t be bothered to report that in her blog posting; I guess it does not fit the narrative of the left or of the supposedly “oppressed” black community. Hey Pam, try owning your shit for a change, you stupid bitch! 😡 I guess it’s all about the struggle and a “Sister” don’t cut another “Sister”, if you know what I mean, and I think you do. 🙄 It goes on to tell that the woman has been out of work for a while; and now she is worried that she will not able to find a job. I can relate the job stuff, been out of work since 2005 and I sometimes wonder if having this blog would hinder me from getting a job. Seeing I have been outed by some serious assholes.

The 14 year old is being held and will most likely be charged as a juvenile. There is a advocacy group that wants the state’s attorney general to look into it as a hate crime, as they should and I personally believe they should be charged for a race related crime too. Those that stood watching should be charged as well for contributing to the crime, by alowing it. People whom are entertained by something and doing nothing to prevent it are just as reaponsible.Especially thoes that warned the perps that cops were on the way. arleigh I would like to think that would have done something but I won’t know till I’m in that place.

"'This has been a difficult, personal decision,' the fundraising powerhouse says in a statement. By ANDY BARR 04/25/2011 03:19 PM EDT Updated 04/26/2011 06:45 AM EDT Haley Barbour said Monday that he won't run for president in 2012, removing a fundraising powerhouse with establishment clout from the Republican primary field. ""This has been a difficult personal decision, and I am very grateful to my family for their total support of my going forward, had that been what I decided,"" the Mississippi governor said in a statement. ""A candidate for president today is embracing a 10-year commitment to an all-consuming effort, to the virtual exclusion of all else,"" Barbour added. ""His (or her) supporters expect and deserve no less than absolute fire in the belly from their candidate. I cannot offer that with certainty, and total certainty is required."" Barbour's announcement stunned political insiders — just hours earlier, many expected him to meet his self-imposed deadline and enter the race by the end of April. The decision was ""surprising to say the least,” said GOPAC chairman and longtime Republican insider Frank Donatelli. “He would have been a very credible candidate with a strong record and access to campaign funds. ... His withdrawal leaves a vacuum for someone else."" Barbour had recently traveled to Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada — all four early-voting states — attracting large followings and ample media attention at most stops. During the campaign-style visits, Barbour told potential supporters that he was ""thinking about running for president"" — but few observers believed he was actually on the fence. Political watchers were quick to speculate that Barbour's move may increase the likelihood that Mitch Daniels — Indiana governor and Barbour's close friend — will indeed run, despite little recent campaign activity on his part. Both had indicated in the past that they did not want to run against each other. But Daniels has continued to sound wary about the race and would face many of the same challenges that Barbour would have encountered — including a spouse who is not eager to embark on a national campaign. Barbour aides didn't have anything to add about his decision. ""He decided not to run"" is all nephew and political hand Henry Barbour said. A Barbour spokesman declined to comment. Another Barbour confidant offered only that “he's an incredibly smart guy who is going to be a huge presence in the party for a long time. While this decision takes out an experienced conservative candidate, I still think we have a great shot at defeating President [Barack] Obama.” The announcement comes a week after a fruitful trip to South Carolina, in which Barbour captured the Charleston County GOP straw poll, commanding 22 percent among the small sample of Republican activists. But his decision also followed waves of negative media attention for his past as a lobbyist and statements that many saw as insensitive on racial issues. Though Barbour tried to deflect attention from previous controversial quotes and embrace his lobbying past head on — arguing bluntly that lobbying is what presidents do — those two issues have frequently dogged the Mississippi governor. His decision may stem, in part, from a perception that the ex-lobbyist and consummate insider could be more effective off the stage than on it. He was also a nonfactor in early state and national polls — he attracted only 1 percent of the vote in a recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey — reflecting a career in which his national political stints were behind the scenes. ""Haley Barbour just confirmed he’s still one of the smartest politicians around,"" Larry Sabato, a politics professor at the University of Virginia, said on The Arena. ""He wasn’t selling to enough Republican activists and voters, even in southern states because of all the factors that have been widely discussed. ... Barbour surveyed the scene, and made the correct call. Why would any sane person go through our torturous presidential selection process unless he believed he had a good chance to win it all? Barbour is now certifiably sane."" Barbour noted the personal nature of his decision in the statement, and indeed, the governor’s wife and family had made clear that they were not looking forward to the pressure of a run. Marsha Barbour recently said in a radio interview that the idea of her husband running for president “horrifies me,” calling a national campaign “a huge sacrifice for a family to make.” Chris Henick, former executive director of the Republican Governors Association, who has known Barbour for decades, said the decision showed that “family matters.” Henick also said the term-limited governor will “play an instrumental role in the 2012 campaign.” What Barbour’s role may be in the 2012 election is somewhat unclear. But his Rolodex alone would be highly valuable to any of the potential Republican camps if he were to endorse in the primary — and will surely be put to use in the general election against Obama. “Haley is a friend and one of the most important political players in the country,” longtime Republican strategist Ed Rollins said. “He also understands the game better than anyone running today and I am sure his decision was difficult and thought out. I have always felt that no matter where he is in the polls today he was going to be one of the finalists. “If he endorses anyone else, they will gain immeasurably by his political skills and fundraising ability,” Rollins added. “He will be missed.” Tim Pawlenty, who is all but certain to run, was the first of Barbour's potential rivals to praise him on his way off stage. ""Nobody has done more than Haley to build the Republican Party over the last three decades,"" Pawlenty said, ""including last year, when I had the privilege to be his vice chairman at the Republican Governors Association. ... When Republicans defeat Barack Obama next year, it will be thanks to the solid party foundation Haley helped build. We wish he and Marsha the best and thank them for all that they do for their state, their Nation, and the Republican Party."" Missing out on the latest scoops?

"Posted | Q: Is it true that rich people pay no taxes on their investment returns? By David Bookstaver, The Associated Press Leona Helmsley, with husband Harry, was convicted in 1989 of evading $1.2 million in federal taxes by billing personal expenses to the business. Harry Helmsley was declared incompetent to stand trial because of memory and reasoning problems. By David Bookstaver, The Associated Press Leona Helmsley, with husband Harry, was convicted in 1989 of evading $1.2 million in federal taxes by billing personal expenses to the business. Harry Helmsley was declared incompetent to stand trial because of memory and reasoning problems. A: Given the increasing concentration of the worlds wealth, its tempting to figure the rich are getting a free ride when it comes to taxes. But, with investors in the U.S., the tax code provides just the opposite. First of all, issues of fraud, cheating and tax evasion by the wealthy goes behind the topic of this column. Theres no question that crafty folks forever have played games with taxing authorities to hide their wealth. Tricks used to reduce taxes range from bribing to simply hiding wealth. Certainly, there are plenty of rich investors who have hired accountants that have illegally, or perhaps legally, reduced their investment taxes to $0. Thats the subject of another forum. But here, we can talk about the rules when it comes to investing. And theres the ironic part. At least according to the U.S. tax code, its lower-income families, not the rich, that get a free ride on taxes due on investment gains, or capital gains. For the tax year 2010, lower-income households in tax brackets below 25% paid a 0% capital gains rate. Meanwhile, the bulk of households that fall into a tax rate of 25% or higher pay the 15% maximum capital gains rate. Meanwhile, any gains on collectibles, say if a wealthy person were to sell part of a prized art collection, is taxed at a much higher 28% capital gains rate. Again, its true that wealthy people might be able to reduce their capital gains to reduce the tax hit. Qualified losses can be used to offset capital gains, which would reduce the size of the gain that must be taxed. And rich people certainly have more assets to move around to manage their tax hits. But this same right to offset gains is provided to taxpayers of all income levels, not just the wealthy.

"by Brett Stevens on April 21, 2011 As back in 1840, America is divided between sets of values. On one side sit the rural, suburban and old-guard types, who want a society centered upon a culture. On the other sit the urban, new-solution types who want a large open air bazaar. You have to admit, it’s comforting on the urban side. Everything is transactional; you don’t get entangled in much. You go somewhere, pay money for goods or a service, and go home. There’s no worrisome issues. Sure, you have to face mortality, but there’s actually a comforting solidity to materialism in the face of morality. You can entirely push it back to one distant event, and in the meantime surround yourself with stuff so real it seems as if that day will never come. And yes, in the city there seems to be a lack of what we’d call faith. There’s no faith in the process of life; it’s a few decades to be exploited and enjoyed. There’s no real faith between people, sexually or otherwise. Everything is a transaction, including marriage, and it’s easier that way on the mind. There are no entangling tendrils of implied meaning, or echoes of eternity. No grandeur, but no complications. Those of us on the other side — the rural/old-guard side — picked it because of how we’re wired. We can point to families of purposeful people who did more than attend jobs. We can point to the challenges they faced and overcame, and what they created. We are a long line stretching into the forgotten past. We struggle with things, and by “things” I mean just about anything in life, because things still have significance. Material things don’t, but they can symbolize events, emotions and important thoughts — thoughts for which we struggle and die, ideas we give our lives to because we see them as important. Asking these two sides to understand each other is pointless and impossible. To the old-guard side, the urban side is life without a soul, and selfish living that delivers no real meaning in life. To the urban side, the old-guard side is unnecessary superstition and an interruption in the process of self-enjoyment. If we say these two are incompatible, we’re tapping into the 200-year divide and mystery of American politics: the South was right — we’re different types of societies, the industrialized coasts and the old-guard interior. Now that we’ve dragged our feet on the issue, we’re even more isolated. We have nothing in common at this point. It’s gotten to the point that I and most other conservatives, when in professional situations, lie about our political beliefs and pretend to be Mother Jones-reading liberals. Otherwise, we get hostility from people we would otherwise befriend. To avoid a future of even more fracture, we should take a page from the states-rights South playbook: let’s make California independent of Federal law on many choices. Let them legalize gay marriage, legalize all drugs, enact single-payer socialized medicine, teach diversity to infants, make abortion vending machines, and whatever else they desire. The rest of us should look on and observe the results. Since the average person is not schooled in political theory, or inclined to crack a book to do so, seeing the consequences of those choices in real-time will be an education for all. Who knows; maybe they’ll make paradise. Maybe for longer than a generation. In science, we always use a control group against which to compare any experimental results. If you have a population of test subjects, most of them become the control group and you try new methods on small breakaway groups. You do this to see what the results are before you contaminate the main population. Otherwise, we’re going to keep hashing it out endlessly, the old-guard versus the open-air bazaar, until the bazaarists are able to destabilize, propagandize, and demagogically pander to enough people to create themselves a permanent neurotic electorate (or import one). Then the country goes full bazaar, followed shortly by totalitarianism of some socialist form, if history is any guide. Rather than rush headlong into this icky future, let’s set up the test case and see how it fairs. California can be the test-bed of our brave new world in its full-bore form."
"Political Byline This blog is no longer active as of October 31, 2011 Posted onApril 27, 2011April 27, 2011AuthorPatrick As you might have noticed, I have not been paying much attention to this blog at all. I do have an excuse. My Father is not doing too well, he has complained about pain in his legs, especially one of them particular. Because of this, this Friday at 2:00P.M., My Father will be going for what is being called a routine procedure to find out what is causing the lack of blood flow to his one leg and correct the problem. Normally, this would not be a problem; but the word “Blood clot” was mentioned. Well, to use a trucker slang of sorts; that is when I stood on the air brakes and stopped the World from turning — Well, my world at least. You see, I lost a very close and friend of mine at the age of 43, due to a blood clot that traveled to his heart from his arm and caused a massive heart attack. That friend’s heart did have some massive blockage already that caused the heart attack, but just same the same; block clots and heart attacks are not what I consider a good time, if you know what I mean. I guess what I am saying here, is that the entire darned thing is freaking me out a bit. Especially seeing that I have to go and sit down there and wonder if this doctor is going to kill my dad or not. The whole idea that they refer to administering medical aid to people as “Practice” sends a shiver down my spine. You ask, “What about your Mother?” She cannot leave my Aunt, who is mentally challenged, alone — as she needs constant care. Therefore, the duty of official family going with my Dad falls on yours truly. My Mom does have a sister, but I will not go into all of that; let’s just say she could give Charlie Sheen a run for his money, in terms of being a blithering idiot. My Father is my friend, which is a vast improvement over my teenage years, when we could hardly stand being around one another. I have gotten older and so has he; we have both mellowed out. However, there are still times, when he drives me up a forty-foot steel wall, of which I most generously admit to reciprocating. Having said that, he is still my Father and I do love the man beyond words; although, I will admit, we both have a funny way of showing it. Although I will tell you this, and if I did not mention this, my mother would most likely beat me senseless, or at least think about it. Remember my aunt that I mentioned —- My Father has been an Angel to her. By going out of his way, to make her feel loved. By cooking her food, tending to her, when she is crying about something that is hurting, often not knowing what it is, as she cannot speak to convey what the trouble is. By tucking her in at night and making sure, she is comfortable. He does all of that, without ever complaining once about it. Having said all of that, My Father is the rock of this family and if anything ever happened to him or my Mom, his wife of over 40 years; I would be left with a hole in my heart and in this family, the size of the Grand Canyon. So, please, those of you who actually read here or wherever I happen to cross-post my writings. Please, keep my Father in your prayers; whatever God it is that you happen to pray to or even if you do not believe in the deity or just happen to be an atheist, say a small prayer or think a good thought about my Dad and myself and more importantly, my Mother. Pray that the good Lord would guide the doctor’s hands and do what is need to fix him and that nothing bad would even remotely happen. My Dad’s name is Charlie, and he is 65 years young. He gave 31 years of his life to the General Motors Company, he votes Democratic Party, but I do not hold it against him. Pray for him this week and especially on Friday, if you would please.

"In the year since Republican Gov. Jan Brewer signed the nation's toughest immigration measure into law, Arizona has been besieged by protests, boycotts and a barrage of negative headlines - not to mention a lawsuit from the Obama administration. But that hasn't deterred a handful of other states from following Arizona's lead. The Justice Department sued over the law, prompting a federal judge to block the most controversial parts of Arizona's SB 1070 before they could take effect, a decision upheld by an appellate court earlier this month. While those rulings may have convinced many states to abandon similar Arizona-style immigration bills this session, others are plowing ahead with their own legislation targeting illegal immigrants. Their message is simple: If Washington won't fix the broken immigration system and secure the border, states will. The Florida House is weighing a bill that would allow local law enforcement to check the immigration status of people who are under investigation or who they suspect are in the country illegally. In Alabama, the House and Senate are reconciling bills that would give state and local police broad authority to check the citizenship of people stopped for other reasons. The South Carolina Senate approved similar legislation. And Georgia GOP Gov. Nathan Deal is expected to sign a similar immigration bill that recently cleared the legislature. ""This is a critically important issue that we felt needed to be dealt with this year,"" said state Rep. Matt Ramsey, a Peachtree City Republican who wrote the Georgia bill. ""The day that we stop addressing tough issues because of threats from the ACLU is the day that we've completely abdicated our responsibility as state policymakers."" The American Civil Liberties Union, one of a handful of groups that sued Arizona last year to block the law from taking effect, has vowed to legally challenge states that attempt to pass so-called ""copycat"" immigration legislation. And other SB 1070 opponents are warning cash-strapped states that they'll have to dig deep into their coffers to defend the laws. ""It's rather stunning when you think about it: These states will have to deal with lawsuits. They will have to spend millions of dollars defending these laws in court. They're going to bear the brunt in the loss of reputation and tourism and convention dollars,"" said Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, an immigration advocacy group based in Washington, D.C. In the wake of SB 1070's enactment, cities and organizations across the country signed on to an economic boycott of Arizona. Groups, including the Service Employees International Union and the National Association of Legal Professionals, announced they wouldn't set foot in Arizona, while the National Urban League nixed its 2012 conference in Phoenix. A study last fall, commissioned by the liberal Center for American Progress and conducted by respected Arizona economist Elliott D. Pollack, found that the Grand Canyon State lost more than $140 million from canceled conventions and conferences. But Ramsey argued that the financial burden of providing health care and public education to illegal immigrants is much heavier. He cited a report by the Federation for American Immigration Reform, an anti-immigration group, that said Georgia schools pays $1.5 billion each year to educate K-12 undocumented children. The study, however, included U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants, who are technically citizens. ""We in the states are struggling financially to deal with this crushing burden that's being placed on us by the federal government's complete and total abdication of their responsibility to secure the nation's borders,"" Ramsey said. Brewer signed SB 1070 into law on April 23, 2010, against the backdrop of the politically charged 2010 campaign, an act that transformed the GOP governor overnight into a national hero of the right and the chief villain of Hispanic and pro-immigration groups. President Barack Obama dismissed the law as ""misguided,"" and his Justice Department sued last July to stop it, arguing that immigration enforcement falls under the power of the federal government, not states. A federal district judge ruled that several of the law's most controversial provisions - including one requiring police to check the citizenship status of anyone suspected of being an illegal immigrant, and another making it a state crime to be in the country illegally - were unconstitutional. A three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that decision earlier this month. But Brewer has stood her ground, counter-suing the federal government for failing to secure the border and vowing to take her fight to the Supreme Court. In a statement marking the one-year anniversary of SB 1070, Brewer said national support for the legislation has been strong, measured by public polls and nearly $4 million in private donations for the law's legal defense fund. Arizona's actions - and the national attention that followed - have put pressure on Obama to secure the border and prompted his decision last May to deploy 1,200 National Guard troops to the Southwest border, Brewer said. ""Arizona has been more than patient in waiting for Washington to take concrete steps to stem the flow of illegal immigration,"" Brewer said. ""After decades of federal inaction and misguided policy, I and the Legislature had no choice but to stand up for the rule of law and the citizens of this great country. Arizona is willing to do the job that the federal government won't do."" Obama administration officials have argued that the border is safer than ever, noting that border patrol apprehensions - a key indicator for illegal immigration activity - are down significantly, and seizures of illegal currency, drugs and weapons are up. Last week at the White House, the president showed renewed interest in comprehensive immigration reform, challenging key stakeholders to help him pass a plan that would beef up border security and offer a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. ""There's no reason why we shouldn't be able to achieve a system that is fair, is equitable, is an economic engine for America that helps the people who are already here get acculturated, and make sure that our laws aren't being broken but we're still true to our traditions,"" Obama said during a stop in California last week. The courts ultimately will settle the constitutionality debate - and Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.) predicted they'll confirm the law ""is unconstitutional, it's unfair, it's prejudiced, it's biased and it is un-American,"" he told hundreds of pro-immigration activists after leading an anti-SB 1070 march last weekend at the Arizona Capitol in Phoenix. Other states are heeding that warning. Already this legislative session, similar immigration bills have failed in at least 10 states, including California, Kansas, Nebraska and New Hampshire. Utah passed an omnibus immigration bill that couples strict Arizona-style measures with a guest worker program - a provision that prompted House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) to urge the Justice Department to sue the state. Meanwhile, states pressing forward with anti-immigration legislation are studying the legal pitfalls that have ensnared the Arizona law, ensuring they don't suffer a similar fate. Last week, the Alabama Senate passed a bill that would require police officers to verify someone's immigration status when they stop them for another infraction, if they have suspicion that person is in the country illegally. The bill also would make it illegal to employ, harbor or transport an illegal immigrant, and would require businesses with more than 25 employees to use the federal E-Verify online system to check the immigration status of workers. The House-passed bill is similar but would only require businesses to use E-Verify if they receive state contracts or grants. With lawsuits on the horizon, Republican Gov. Robert Bentley urged House and Senate negotiators to iron out their differences and send him legislation that will withstand legal scrutiny. ""We need a bill that's not only strong but one that's defendable,"" Bentley said, according to the Birmingham News. ""If it goes to court, we'll have to defend it."""
"Sign In President's Easter was worship of resentment, not resurrection Manage Newsletters Shameless politicians use 9/11 to lecture America about “unity” Biden’s forced COVID-19 vaccine attack on minorities Dems’ totalitarian overreach threatens Americans’ livelihood White(wash) House ANALYSIS/OPINION: Is President Obama a black nationalist? This goes to the heart of his presidency - and partly explains why Mr. Obama is losing the broad middle of America. On Easter, Mr. Obama and his family attended Shiloh Baptist Church in Washington. The liberal press corps made much of the fact that the church was founded in 1863 by freed slaves. Yet the church’s pastor, the Rev. Wallace Charles Smith, is a race-baiting black nationalist. He is a more polished version of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, a longtime pastor of Mr. Obama’s. Mr. Smith lacks the bombast of Mr. Wright but peddles the same philosophy of racialism, grievance-mongering and black victimology. In one of his recent sermons, Mr. Smith argued that institutionalized racism continues. “Anytime a swimming club can deny membership to students simply because they are African-American or Hispanic is an indication that Barack’s presidency does not solve the question of justice in this nation,” he said. Really? Where and at what institutions are blacks and Hispanics denied access to swimming pools? This is a figment of Mr. Smith’s imagination. He further stressed that segregation was not really eradicated; rather, it has simply morphed into a more subtle system of racial oppression through conservative talk radio and widespread opposition to affirmative action. TOP STORIES CNN poll: America turns irate, glum 'No SALT, no deal': Vulnerable Dems threaten revolt unless $3.5T bill cuts blue-states taxes Pentagon tries to calm base residents over Afghan measles cases “Now Jim Crow wears blue pinstripes and goes to law school and carries fancy briefs and cases,” Mr. Smith said. “And he doesn’t have to wear white robes anymore because now he can wear the protective cover of talk radio or can get a regular news program on Fox.” He even compared Rush Limbaugh to the Ku Klux Klan and the White Citizens’ Council. In other words, conservatives - Mr. Obama’s critics - are incorrigibly racist and seek to perpetuate a watered-down form of apartheid. For Mr. Smith and many others on the left, disagreeing with racial quotas is not only wrong, but evil - a manifestation of deep-seated intolerance and bigotry. The opposite is true: Conservatives are the true heirs of the civil rights movement. They believe in a colorblind society and equality under the law. This is why affirmative action is so pernicious. It has created a racial spoils system whereby groups are systematically pitted against one another: Ethnic revanchism - the obsession with identity - is rampant. Merit no longer is the primary basis for many hiring decisions, university admissions or government contracts. Race, gender and (increasingly) sexual orientation are the new standards. Moreover, no other nation in history has done more to alleviate the injustices of its past or create a more open, fair and tolerant society for minorities than America - especially regarding black Americans. Our president and attorney general are black; both of President George W. Bush’s secretaries of state were black; blacks occupy numerous key positions in Fortune 500 companies; blacks dominate much of the sports and entertainment industries; and many of America’s leading cultural icons are black - including Bill Cosby, Michael Jordan, Oprah Winfrey and Beyonce. Yet, none of this matters to Mr. Smith and other black nationalists, such as Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson and the infamous Mr. Wright. This is because black nationalism is an outgrowth of 1960s chic radicalism. It is racialism disguised as progressive politics. It combines socialism with xenophobic tribalism. For racialists like Mr. Smith, reality must not be allowed to puncture their central myth: The white man is the devil. Slavery was abolished nearly 150 years ago. But Mr. Smith gives the impression that blacks were enslaved only yesterday. During his Easter sermon, he pointed with pride to his 4-week-old grandson, whose gurgling, according to Mr. Smith, was actually “talking.” And what was the little piker saying? “I am here … they tried to write me off as three-fifths of a person in the Constitution, but I am here right now … and is saying I am not going to let anybody stop me from being what God wants me to be,” Mr. Smith said. Leave aside that I never knew infants could talk (apparently, miracles really do happen under the progressive messiah, Mr. Obama). Mr. Limbaugh, Fox News, the GOP - not one of them seeks to restore slavery or the three-fifths clause in the Constitution, or deny any black child a shot at the American dream. To suggest otherwise is kooky. It is shocking that Mr. Obama - our commander in chief who is supposed to embody our highest ideals - chose this church to celebrate Easter. He sat in the pews nodding in approval as Mr. Smith peddled his racialist vitriol. A disturbing pattern is emerging. For 20 years, Mr. Obama sat in the church of an anti-American pastor who constantly railed against “white greed” and “white oppression.” The president’s hand-picked attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr., has called America “a nation of cowards” when it comes to race. His Justice Department has refused to prosecute members of the New Black Panthers for blatant voter intimidation. Mr. Obama has openly embraced Mr. Sharpton, an odious race-baiter. It is clear by his actions and affiliations that Mr. Obama has black nationalist sympathies. The result is that he appears increasingly strange to many voters; his racial socialist politics are alien to the American tradition. They belong more to the Third World. This explains why Middle America is turning its back on Mr. Obama. When Americans voted for him in 2008, they thought they were getting a liberal pragmatist, a modern-day Franklin D. Roosevelt or John F. Kennedy. Instead, they got a Rev. Jeremiah Wright in blue pinstripes who attended law school. Jeffrey T. Kuhner is a columnist at The Washington Times and president of the Edmund Burke Institute. Manage Newsletters "
"Despite the news that some prominent hedge fund managers are abandoning him, President Barack Obama is not giving up on Wall Street fundraising. Tonight he is hitting the town hard—and hitting up Wall Street hard as well. He is in New York for a bunch of fund raisers that begin at the home of former New Jersey Governor Jon Corzine. About 60 people are expected to attend, including many prominent Wall Street figures. Each has ponied up $35,800 for the privilege. Afterwards, Obama will head to a second dinner at the Waldorf Astoria. This one will have about 340 people, according to the Wall Street Journal. Each of them will also be expected to contribute $35,800 to Democratic campaign coffers. So who is the biggest name showing up at tonight's events? We hear that JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon may be at the Corzine shindig. JPMorgan couldn't be reached to confirm the story. There are also whispers that Lloyd Blankfein and a few other top Goldman executives might make an appearance at Corzine's. (Corzine was once the CEO of Goldman.) ______________________________________________ Questions? Comments?

"Sign In White House aversion to transparency undermines good government Manage Newsletters Shameless politicians use 9/11 to lecture America about “unity” Biden’s forced COVID-19 vaccine attack on minorities Dems’ totalitarian overreach threatens Americans’ livelihood White(wash) House ANALYSIS/OPINION: Barack Hussein Obama II was born on Aug. 4, 1961, in Honolulu, Hawaii. For over two years, the president has resisted pressure to divulge this simple biographical information, which proves he’s a natural-born citizen. The belated White House release of the “long form” birth certificate answers one constitutional issue, but a host of other questions remains about the most mysterious president in modern history. Mr. Obama’s hostility to openness drives the public’s curiosity about the most basic facts of his life. For example, he has refused to release his college and law-school transcripts, information recent presidential candidates have openly shown the public despite some embarrassment over decades-old bad grades. What is there for this president to hide? Maybe he flunked government classes or got busted for dope. He has openly discussed his past drug use, but is there more to it? Secrecy breeds speculation. The list of hidden Obama documents includes medical records from his annual physical - which other presidents have made public - and first lady Michelle Obama’s law-firm records. Is she covering up a Hillary Clinton-type Whitewater case? Who knows. Perhaps the biggest secret in the Obama administration: What is the president’s golf handicap? He’s played 65 rounds in two years, so is his swing improving? Or, does he force staff aides in his usual foursome to let him take presidential mulligans? TOP STORIES CNN poll: America turns irate, glum 'No SALT, no deal': Vulnerable Dems threaten revolt unless $3.5T bill cuts blue-states taxes Pentagon tries to calm base residents over Afghan measles cases Donald Trump takes full credit for the timing of Wednesday’s long-delayed Obama disclosure, as the real-estate mogul launched his own investigation into the presidential birth certificate. “Today I’m very proud of myself because I’ve accomplished something that no one else was able to accomplish,” Mr. Trump boasted after landing his Trump-branded helicopter in New Hampshire.”Now we can talk about oil; we can talk about gasoline prices; we can talk about China ripping off this country. … We can get onto issues.” The fact that Mr. Obama did his own dirty laundry reminds that this president has no inkling how to act presidential. Standing at the podium over the seal of the presidency, he claimed, “We don’t have time for this silliness.” He then flew to Chicago with Michelle to tape the Oprah Winfrey show and attend three fundraisers. It’s not as if he didn’t have more important news to discuss such as the appointments of Leon E. Panetta as secretary of defense and Gen. David H. Petraeus as CIA director, Middle East turmoil or America’s multiple wars. Let a flack handle the tabloid fare. The birth-certificate brouhaha reiterates an old political truth: It’s always the cover-up that causes the most trouble. Too bad Mr. Obama didn’t learn his lesson. Manage Newsletters "
"Sign In Adherents resort to insults rather than intelligent debate Manage Newsletters Shameless politicians use 9/11 to lecture America about “unity” Biden’s forced COVID-19 vaccine attack on minorities Dems’ totalitarian overreach threatens Americans’ livelihood White(wash) House ANALYSIS/OPINION: While inspecting the body politic, one encounters one clear sign that liberalism is dead. It is the condition of our political discourse. Polite commentators note that the dialogue is “rancorous.” Some say toxic. Actually, it is worse than that. It is nonexistent. From the right, from the sophisticated right, there is an attempt to engage the liberals. Budget Chairman Paul Ryan, Wisconsin Republican, just did it by presenting a budget that cried out for intelligent response. President Obama’s response was to invite Mr. Ryan to sit in the front row for Mr. Obama’s “fiscal policy” speech at George Washington University. There, Mr. Obama heaped scorn on an astonished Mr. Ryan and his work. He did not even mention Mr. Ryan’s name. This is what Mr. Obama calls an “adult” debate? From the rest of the liberals there generally is silence. They prattle on about Glenn Beck or Sarah Palin, but they pay almost no heed to the think tanks on the right, to their journals of opinion or to the writers and figures of heft. The liberals are dead. There are the zombies out there - well-known politicians such as Al Gore - or writers such as New York Times columnist Paul Krugman who howls about the Heritage Foundation while fudging that think tank’s findings or about the aforementioned Mr. Ryan. But there is no one capable of engaging the serious conservatives. None even tries. Their idea of dialogue amounts to hurling lines fit for a bumper sticker - “I am a citizen of the world” or “War is not the answer.” Or perhaps they hurl a slur - conservatives are “extreme,” though by now, the conservatives have been around for decades and running the country more frequently than not: the Reagan and Bush administrations and the Gingrich Congress. Have the liberals not noticed this? As I say, liberalism is dead. TOP STORIES CNN poll: America turns irate, glum 'No SALT, no deal': Vulnerable Dems threaten revolt unless $3.5T bill cuts blue-states taxes Pentagon tries to calm base residents over Afghan measles cases This has not always been the case. There was a time when liberals - say, Daniel Patrick Moynihan - engaged conservatives brilliantly. They knew what conservatives thought. They even could find elements of conservative thought that they disagreed with without disfiguring that thought and pouncing on the resultant red herring. This is not the way it is today. There has been a change in the politically charged audience in this great republic. It is not in the vituperation. The vituperation has always been out there. Sometimes it has been delicious. As early as the presidency of George Washington, invective was eloquent of the political bad blood between the contending factions. In looking for a secretary of state to replace Edmund Randolph, Washington was turned down by five candidates; the last, Rufus King, explained to Washington’s agent, Alexander Hamilton, that he had rejected the offer because of “the foul and venomous shafts of calumny” then being heaved at public servants. Washington was disparaged as a monarchist, Hamilton as a lackey. Things have not improved in the public discourse since then. Yet now, something is different. I blame the liberals. They do not engage their adversaries. They have been able to avoid doing so because they have controlled the public media, the Kultursmog. The smog reported their grotesqueries with the utmost seriousness. Thus, if you were visiting from a foreign country, you might think Glenn Beck to be a major force in American politics and you might be gravely frightened of Mr. Beck and of Fox News. But Mr. Beck is only an entertainer, and he is leaving Fox News - some say under duress. Sarah Palin and her whole family might sound like the Marcos family of the Philippines, but she is from Alaska and out of office. Or take the recent imbroglio between Mr. Krugman and the Heritage Foundation. Heritage recently ran Mr. Ryan’s numbers through a perfectly mainstream, nonpolitical, economic model, the U.S. Macroeconomic Model developed by Global Insight. Mr. Krugman responded in a New York Times column by impugning Heritage’s integrity, claiming Heritage used a model that would force the conclusions that Heritage wanted. Heritage’s Bill Beach called out Mr. Krugman in an open letter. Now it has been more than a week, and not a peep of response from Mr. Krugman. As I say, liberalism is dead, but its nigh-unto-totalitarian control of media has ended. Fox News, talk radio and the Internet have arrived. Raise a toast to free speech. R.

Watch and subscribe today! 111 K Street NE Suite 600 Washington, DC 20002 Our Founding Fathers set out to create the freest nation known to man. These brave men rejected the tyrannical rule of King George III by signing the Declaration of Independence. The Founders later wrote the Bill of Rights which lists our natural rights in order to set limitations on the power of the federal government. America was founded on the principle of federalism. The so-called anti-federalists who pushed for a Bill of Rights strongly believed in a decentralized government where power was divided between federal and state governments. The federal government only has about thirty enumerated powers delegated to it in the Constitution. According to the Tenth Amendment, any issue not found in the U.S. Constitution should be left up to individual states to decide. It clearly reads that, “the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.” Nearly 250 years later, the United States has gone grossly astray from the Founding Father’s vision. The federal government is involved in nearly every aspect of our daily lives from what foods we put into our bodies to what we’re allowed to watch on television. We have elected officials in Washington such as Rep. Pete Stark (D-Calif.) who claims that “the federal government can do most anything in this country.” Even though former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) took an oath to defend the Constitution, she asked a reporter if he was serious when he asked where specifically the Constitution grants Congress the authority to enact an individual health insurance mandate. Congress violates the Constitution virtually every day while in session. Both parties are to blame. Many states are fed up and are fighting back against unconstitutional federal laws such as ObamaCare. With a Democratic-controlled Senate and President Obama still in the White House, it will prove an arduous task to get ObamaCare repealed through congressional action in Washington, D.C. anytime soon. As it currently stands, a total of 27 states have filed suit against ObamaCare. Thus far, two federal judges have upheld ObamaCare’s individual mandate to purchase health insurance while two others have ruled it unconstitutional. The individual health insurance mandate is clearly unconstitutional. Just as the anti-federalists feared, many people have misinterpreted the commerce clause in the Constitution to justify expansion of federal power at the expense of the states. The original intent of the commerce clause was to promote trade and exchange between states. It was surely never meant to force individuals to buy health insurance simply because they exist. Historian and author of Nullification: How to Resist Federal Tyranny in the 21st Century, Dr. Tom Woods writes that the “If the federal government has the exclusive right to judge the extent of its own powers, warned the Kentucky and Virginia resolutions’ authors (Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, respectively), it will continue to grow – regardless of elections, the separation of powers, and other much-touted limits on government power.” There is a conflict of interest with the federal court arbitrating disputes between the states and the federal government over the constitutionality of the federal government’s action. Just like Jefferson feared, the Supreme Court has a history of siding with the federal government instead of the states. The unfortunate truth is that the Supreme Court has upheld many unconstitutional federal laws. As Andrew Nappi of the Florida Tenth Amendment Center says “this would be like having your ex's mother as the final judge on the structure of your divorce settlement.”Various states are taking another approach to defeat ObamaCare. These states are considering the idea of nullification. Idaho Governor Otter recently said “we are actively exploring all our options - including nullification.” State nullification is the idea that states can refuse to enforce unconstitutional federal laws. Thomas Jefferson and James Madison both spoke of the favor of nullification. In 1798, Thomas Jefferson wrote “whensoever the general government assumes undelegated powers….a nullification of the act is the rightful remedy.” Likewise, James Madison said that states were “duty bound to resist” every time the federal government violated the Constitution. Some states aren’t waiting for the outcomes of federal lawsuits in federal courts. They’re simultaneously attempting to make ObamaCare void in their state legislatures. According to the Tenth Amendment Center, “nullification is a tool in the bag of those who want to dam the river of government expansion. It has been used before, and to good ends.” Thus far, 12 states have introduced similar versions to the Federal Health Care Nullification Act drafted by the Tenth Amendment Center this year. These bills either fully nullify or refuse compliance with ObamaCare. The Federal Health Care Nullification Act introduced in Texas (HB297), Montana (SB161), Wyoming (HB0035), Oregon (HB498) and Maine (LD558) all state that ObamaCare is “hereby declared to be invalid, shall not be recognized, is specifically rejected, and shall be considered null and void and of no effect.” Idaho recently passed HB 298 which is nicknamed the “grandson of nullification.”The 10th amendment is making a roaring comeback. Nullification has recently been used to stop federal gun laws, the Real ID and federal drug laws. Five states have introduced bills to nullify any legislation from the Environmental Protection Act (EPA) regulating greenhouse gases and the “Food Safety and Modernization Act.” In his book, Tom Woods explains that nullification has been used throughout history to support free speech, free trade and unconstitutional searches and seizures. The Supreme Court of Wisconsin used nullification to declare the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 unconstitutional. The federal government has overstepped its constitutional limits. We can put an end to the federal government takeover of our healthcare system and other unconstitutional federal initiatives. With so many states fighting back against ObamaCare, it should send a clear message to the Obama administration. We the people do not want ObamaCare forced upon us. Before bringing something into law it must be fully read and read even again to confirm if it is what our people need or want. To make something law before it is understood or to make it law before the book is open is nothing but tyranny. I am in the Philippines, at this time, and find no need or use to this obamacare and when i return home, i will not be forced to pay for something i do not want or even need. Since Judge Amy Coney Barrett was nominated to serve on the Supreme Court, Joe Biden and Senate Democrats have repeatedly said that Barrett would be a vote to strike down the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which most of us know as Obamacare.  Foundation's Regulatory Action Center (RAC) submitted comments to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) regarding regulatory changes for outpatient facilities. This proposal would grant more flexibility to physicians and patients to seek care at lower costs. It also repeals regulations unnecessarily implemented by Obamacare. If you used your free time on Saturday or Sunday to watch football, you may have seen an ad run by Joe Biden’s campaign in which the narrator says that Biden won’t raise taxes on anyone earning less than $400,000 annually. The ad perpetuates the myth that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was a “tax cut for the rich.” As Chris Edwards of the Cato Institute notes, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act “provided the largest percentage tax cuts to the bottom two quintiles—that is, the bottom 40 percent of U.S. households.” WASHINGTON, D.C. -- In response to the House passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Enhancement Act, H.R. 1425, on a largely party-line vote, Jason Pye,  Vice President of Legislative Affairs, commented: On behalf of ’ activist community, I urge you to contact your representative and ask him or her to vote NO on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Enhancement Act, H.R. 1425. This bill doubles down on ObamaCare by attempting to force more people into both the exchanges and Medicaid while also adding on socialist-style price controls on prescription drugs. Although Democrats have made clear that Medicare for All remains their policy end-goal, this latest proposal seems to show that they are content in the meantime to continue herding patients into the existing silos that ObamaCare narrowed health care payments into. Democrats are expected to vote early next week on a bill, H.R. 1425, entitled the “Patient Protection and Affordable Care Enhancement Act.” The bill is exactly what it explicitly claims to be - a doubling down on the original structure of ObamaCare, with some extra patches added in. This is likely a foreshadowing of the push we’ll see to take the next step in expanding government control of health care should Democrats succeed in taking the White House in 2020. On behalf of ’ activist community, I urge you to contact your representative and senators ask them to cosponsor the American Healthshare Plans Act, H.R. 6712 and S. 3610, introduced in the House by Rep. John Curtis (R-Utah) and in the Senate by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.). This bill would allow non-employer membership organizations to offer health insurance to individuals, including across state lines, opening up a much-needed alternate path to coverage. On behalf of ’ activist community, I urge you to contact your senators and ask them to vote NO on the disapproval resolution under the Congressional Review Act (CRA), S.J.Res. 52, to roll back state innovation waivers for healthcare. Introduced by Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), this resolution targets guidance issued by the Department of the Treasury and the Department of Health and Human Services that made it easier for states to get “state innovation waivers” under Section 1332 of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). On behalf of our activist community, I urge you to contact your representative and ask him or her to cosponsor the Health Coverage Choice Act, H.R. 4811, introduced by Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.). The bill would codify the Trump Administration rulemaking on short-term, limited-duration (STLD) health plans, which expanded these plans to a maximum of 12 months from three months and allowed renewability for up to 36 months.  Foundation's Regulatory Action Center (RAC) is driving comments in support of the Department of Interior's recent proposal related to hunting and fishing regulations. The proposal would provide new or expanded hunting and fishing opportunities at 74 national wildlife refuges and 15 national fish hatcheries managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) across more than 1.4 million acres of land. It would also harmonize federal regulations with state regulations in many cases. This would decrease the patchwork of red tape hunters and fishers have to navigate and would give more power to state and local authorities to determine what's best. Want more freedom?

"The Man of Steel has announced that he intends to renounce his US citizenship. The Man of Steel’s declaration has caused consternation online among readers who believe he is abandoning his ideals of “truth, justice and the American way”. In a speech before the United Nations, which appears in the latest issue of Action Comics, The Man of Steel said he wants to become a citizen of the world, after he is accused of causing an international incident by flying to Iran amid a large protest. The nine-page story was written by David S. Goyer and was drawn by Miguel Sepulveda. “I’m tired of having my actions construed as instruments of US policy,” the superhero says in a short story in the issue, Action Comics No. 900. “‘Truth, justice and the American way’ — it’s not enough anymore,” he says. “The world’s too small, too connected.” In the comic, Superman never actually renounces his citizenship, he only talks about his plans to do it. Commentators reacted with disgust to the new storyline. In a blog post at The Weekly Standard, senior writer Jonathan Last questioned Superman’s beliefs, now that he seems to have rejected the United States. “Does he believe in British interventionism or Swiss neutrality?” Last wrote. “You see where I’m going with this: If Superman doesn’t believe in America, then he doesn’t believe in anything.” The new plot twist for Superman comes as the Kryptonian, who was raised by a Kansas farmer and his wife, looks to take on a more global mission for his battle against evil. DC Comics co-publishers Jim Lee and Dan DiDio seemed to downplay their landmark superhero character’s latest declaration, in a joint statement. “In a short story in Action Comics 900, Superman announces his intention to put a global focus on his never ending battle, but he remains, as always, committed to his adopted home and his roots as a Kansas farm boy from Smallville,” they said. It is not the first time a comic character has been fed up with being seen as part of U.S. policy. In the 1970s, Marvel Comics’ Captain America gave up his famed suit and shield and adopted the identity Nomad around the time the Watergate scandal began heating up."
"Carl Schmitt (1888–1985) was a conservative German legal, constitutional, and political theorist. Schmitt is often considered to be one of the most important critics of liberalism, parliamentary democracy, and liberal cosmopolitanism. But the value and significance of Schmitt’s work is subject to controversy, mainly due to his intellectual support for and active involvement with National Socialism. Carl Schmitt’s early career as an academic lawyer falls into the last years of the Wilhelmine Empire. (See for Schmitt’s life and career: Bendersky 1983; Balakrishnan 2000; Mehring 2009.) But Schmitt wrote his most influential works, as a young professor of constitutional law in Bonn and later in Berlin, during the Weimar-period: Political Theology, presenting Schmitt’s theory of sovereignty, appeared in 1922, to be followed in 1923 by The Crisis of Parliamentary Democracy, which attacked the legitimacy of parliamentary government. In 1927, Schmitt published the first version of his most famous work, The Concept of the Political, defending the view that all true politics is based on the distinction between friend and enemy. The culmination of Schmitt’s work in the Weimar period, and arguably his greatest achievement, is the 1928 Constitutional Theory, which systematically applied Schmitt’s political theory to the interpretation of the Weimar constitution. During the political and constitutional crisis of the later Weimar Republic Schmitt published Legality and Legitimacy, a clear-sighted analysis of the breakdown of parliamentary government in Germany, as well as The Guardian of the Constitution, which argued that the president as the head of the executive, and not a constitutional court, ought to be recognized as the guardian of the constitution. In these works from the later Weimar period, Schmitt’s declared aim to defend the Weimar constitution is at times barely distinguishable from a call for constitutional revision towards a more authoritarian political framework (Dyzenhaus 1997, 70–85; Berthold 1999; Kennedy 2004, 154–78; Breuer 2012). Though Schmitt had not been a supporter of National Socialism before Hitler came to power, he sided with the Nazis after 1933. Schmitt quickly obtained an influential position in the legal profession and came to be perceived as the ‘Crown Jurist’ of National Socialism. (Rüthers 1990; Mehring 2009, 304–436) He devoted himself, with undue enthusiasm, to such tasks as the defence of Hitler’s extra-judicial killings of political opponents (PB 227–32) and the purging of German jurisprudence of Jewish influence (Gross 2007; Mehring 2009, 358–80). But Schmitt was ousted from his position of power within legal academia in 1936, after infighting with academic competitors who viewed Schmitt as a turncoat who had converted to Nazism only to advance his career. There is considerable debate about the causes of Schmitt’s willingness to associate himself with the Nazis. Some authors point to Schmitt’s strong ambition and his opportunistic character but deny ideological affinity (Bendersky 1983, 195–242; Schwab 1989). But a strong case has been made that Schmitt’s anti-liberal jurisprudence, as well as his fervent anti-semitism, disposed him to support the Nazi regime (Dyzenhaus 1997, 85–101; Scheuerman 1999). Throughout the later Nazi period, Schmitt’s work focused on questions of international law. The immediate motivation for this turn seems to have been the aim to justify Nazi-expansionism. But Schmitt was interested in the wider question of the foundations of international law, and he was convinced that the turn towards liberal cosmopolitanism in 20th century international law would undermine the conditions of stable and legitimate international legal order. Schmitt’s theoretical work on the foundations of international law culminated in The Nomos of the Earth, written in the early 1940’s, but not published before 1950. Due to his support for and involvement with the Nazi dictatorship, Schmitt was briefly detained and interrogated at the end of the war as a potential defendant in the Nuremberg trials (ECS; AN), the legitimacy of which he impugned in a legal brief prepared for the defense of the German industrialist Friedrich Flick (IC). The obstinately unrepentant Schmitt was not allowed to return to an academic job after 1945 (Mehring 2009, 438–63). But he nevertheless remained an important figure in West Germany’s conservative intellectual scene to his death in 1985 (van Laak 2002) and enjoyed a considerable degree of clandestine influence elsewhere (Scheuerman 1999, 183–251; Müller 2003). Unsurprisingly, the significance and value of Schmitt’s works is subject to heated controversy (Caldwell 2005). A group of authors sympathetic to Schmitt argue that Schmitt’s analysis of liberal constitutionalism during the Weimar period is separable from his support for National Socialism and that it constitutes an insightful and important analysis of the political presuppositions of a well-functioning liberal constitutional system (Bendersky 1983; Schwab 1989; Gottfried 1990; Kennedy 2004; Schupmann 2017). From the left, Schmitt’s work is sometimes taken to illustrate the affinities between a purely economic liberalism and political authoritarianism (Mauss 1980; Cristi 1998). The view that the Schmitt of the Weimar period can be read as a defender of liberal order has been questioned by authors who stress the continuity between Schmitt’s conceptions of law, sovereignty, and democracy and fascist ideology (Wolin 1992; Dyzenhaus 1997; Scheuerman 1999). However, engagement with Schmitt is nevertheless considered to be important. It has been argued that Rawlsian political liberalism is vulnerable to Schmitt’s critique of liberalism due to its unwillingness to base itself explicitly on a liberal conception of the good (Dyzenhaus 1997, 218–58) or due to its refusal to recognize the antagonistic nature of politics (Mouffe 1999b). Moreover, Schmitt’s views on sovereignty and emergency powers are often seen as the intellectual basis of contemporary calls for a strong executive power unhampered by constraints of legality (Dyzenhaus 2006, 35–54; Scheuerman 2006; Posner and Vermeule 2010, 3–24). Finally, there are an increasing number of authors who concentrate on particular arguments of Schmitt’s that are seen as worth developing in a systematic context. Two focal points of recent interest are Schmitt’s theory of popular sovereignty (Arato 1995; Lindahl 2007; Kalyvas 2008, 79–186; Loughlin 2010, 209–37; Kahn 2011; Colon-Rios 2012, 79–101; Minkkinen 2013; Vinx 2013a) and his conception of international order (Odysseos and Petito 2007; Slomp 2009; Legg 2011; Benhabib, 2012; Vinx 2013b; Hathaway and Shapiro 2017, chapter 10). Modern liberal constitutions do not acknowledge a bearer of sovereign authority, and modern legal and constitutional theory has often tried to dispense with the concept. But Schmitt argues, in Political Theology, that such attempts to get rid of sovereignty cannot be successful. In Schmitt’s view, there can be no functioning legal order without a sovereign authority (PT 5–35; Dyzenhaus 1997, 42–51; McCormick 1997, 121–56; Hofmann 2002, 49–64; Kennedy 2004, 54–91; Kahn 2011, 31–61; Croce and Salvatore 2013, 13–29; Vinx 2015). According to Schmitt, liberal constitutionalists typically hold that all legitimate particular acts of state must apply general legal norms, so that people are subject only to the determinate and predictable demands of the law, not to the potentially arbitrary authority of persons (PT 18–26; see also CT 169–96, CPD 33–50). This view overlooks, Schmitt argues, that general legal norms often fail to provide determinate guidance without considerable interpretation and interstitial legislation (PT 29–35; GU 21–43). In order for the law to become effective, there needs to be an authority that decides how to apply general legal rules to concrete cases and how to deal with problems of contested interpretation or under-determination. However, the material content of the law does not itself determine who is to interpret and to apply it. Hence, a sovereign authority prior to the law is needed to decide how to apply general legal norms to particular cases (PT 29–35). This argument appears to assume that all legal norms are material norms providing substantive grounds of legal decision. But modern legal systems typically contain norms of competence in addition to material norms. Hence, it seems that the view that all legitimate political authority depends on legal authorization is not as indefensible as Schmitt suggests (Kaufmann 1988, 337–45). The law can determine, for any material legal norm, which person or institution has the competence to interpret and apply it. Subjects of the law may admittedly have to accept that a final decision might turn out to be binding even though wrong. And in this limited sense, Schmitt is right to appeal to Hobbes’s dictum that it is authority and not truth that makes the law. (PT 33–4) But that a legal system, through its norms of competence, provides for the authoritative interpretation of its material legal norms hardly entails that it must contain a sovereign in the traditional understanding of that term. Schmitt’s implicit reply to this objection claims that the applicability of legal norms presupposes a general condition of social normality. Legal norms, Schmitt argues, cannot be applied to a chaos. They require a “homogeneous medium.” (PT 13) No legal norm, in Schmitt’s view, can govern an extreme case of emergency or an absolute state of exception. In a completely abnormal situation, the continued application of the law through the normal administrative and judiciary channels is going to lead to haphazard and unpredictable results, while preventing effective action to end the emergency (PT 13; GU 44–114; Scheuerman 1996; Hofmann 2002, 17–33). If the applicability of material legal norms presupposes a condition of normality, Schmitt assumes, a polity must be entitled to decide whether to suspend the application of its law on the ground that the situation is abnormal. Hence Schmitt’s famous definition of sovereignty, according to which the sovereign is he who decides on the state of exception: If there is some person or institution, in a given polity, capable of bringing about a total suspension of the law and then to use extra-legal force to normalize the situation, then that person or institution is the sovereign in that polity (PT 5). Any legal order, Schmitt bluntly concludes, is based on a sovereign decision and not on a legal norm (PT 10, 12–3). One might reply to this line of thought that it is perfectly possible to establish legal conditions for the declaration of a state of emergency as well as legal constraints on the permissible means of dealing with an emergency. Schmitt argues, though, that attempts to legalize the exceptional situation are doomed to failure. It is impossible to anticipate the nature of future emergencies and to determine in advance what means might be necessary to deal with them. As a result, the positive law can at best determine who is to decide whether there is an emergency that requires a wholesale suspension of the law. But the sovereign decision cannot be guided by existing material law (PT 11–2). In Schmitt’s view, it is not even necessary for the law to determine who can take a decision on the exception. There can be a sovereign authority, in a jurisprudentially relevant sense, even where such an authority is not recognized by positive constitutional law. All that matters is whether there is a person or institution that possesses the ability, as a matter of fact, to take a decision on the exception. If a sovereign, so understood, exists, its authority to suspend the law does not stand in need of positive legal recognition, since the law’s applicability itself depends on a situation of normality secured by the sovereign (PT 12–3). What about cases, though, where sovereignty is not just unrecognized in positive law but where there is no one, as a matter of fact, who could successfully take a decision to suspend the law altogether? This condition seems to apply in many contemporary western democracies. Perhaps such polities are ill-prepared to deal with radical emergencies. But it would be implausible to conclude that they do not possess a legal order. Schmitt’s full response to this objection will only become clear from his discussion of ‘the political.’ The objection suggests, however, that Schmitt’s claims about sovereignty cannot plausibly be understood as claims about the presuppositions of the mere factual existence of a legal system. Schmitt must be arguing that wherever the situation of normality or homogeneity that makes the results of the application of law determinate and predictable is no longer guaranteed by a sovereign, the positive legal system, consisting of material norms and of positive norms of competence, can no longer be legitimate (Mauss 1980, 81–121; Scheuerman 1999, 15–37; Hofmann 2002). If the sovereign’s decision on the exception is not subject to any material legal constraint, the power to decide on the state of exception is tantamount to the power to decide what should count as a state of exception (PT 13; Norris 2007). A sovereign’s view on this issue, however, must be responsive to prevailing social attitudes. If it were not, a sovereign could hardly possess the factual capability to suspend the law and to act successfully against the perceived emergency. To do so, his decision will need to be supported by a sufficiently large and powerful constituency. Nevertheless, the need for sovereign decision will be greatest in a society torn by serious ideological or social conflict. And if there is no unanimity among social groups as to what situation to perceive as normal or exceptional, the sovereign decision will inevitably have to side with one group’s conception of normality against that of another. The sovereign creation of a condition of normality, in other words, constitutes a community’s political identity and it is likely to do so through the forcible suppression of those whose conception of normality differs from the sovereign’s (D 132–47). The question of the legitimacy of law thus turns on the question of the legitimacy of an identity-constituting sovereign exercise of foundational violence. Schmitt admits that the principle of democracy is the only principle of legitimacy that is available as an ideological basis for a contemporary constitution (PT 50–2; CPD 22–32). If Schmitt’s conception of sovereignty is to be defensible, it must therefore be given a democratic interpretation. But it is difficult to see how this could be possible. The only candidate for sovereignty in a democratic polity is the popular sovereign, composed of politically equal citizens. A popular sovereign, it seems, cannot be a Schmittian sovereign, as it will only be able to decide under existing constitutional rules that determine how the people as a collective are to form a unified will. Schmitt prepared the groundwork for a solution to this problem in Dictatorship, his historical study of the development of the institution of dictatorship (McCormick 1997, 121–56; Cristi 1998 108–25; Kalyvas 2008, 88–126; Kelly 2016). Dictatorial power in its original, Roman form is a formally delegated and time-limited power to defend an already existing republican constitution through the use of extra-legal force (D xlii–xliv, 1–19). A Roman dictator, then, was clearly not a sovereign in Schmitt’s sense of the term. In the course of modern constitutional history, however, the institution of dictatorship, Schmitt claims, fused with sovereignty, and this fusion related sovereignty to democracy. The first step towards this fusion, in Schmitt’s account, was the use of commissarial dictatorship in the early modern absolutist state. The absolutist sovereign did possess the sovereign power to decide on the exception, and was thus capable of authorizing commissars to use dictatorial methods in his name. But the notions of dictatorship and sovereignty were not yet fused. The commissarial dictators of the absolutist sovereign were mere agents of the sovereign and did not themselves possess the power to decide on the exception. The absolutist sovereign, in turn, though he had the power to decide on the exception, was not himself a dictator; first of all since he did not decide under someone else’s but by his own authority, and secondly because he was of course expected to rely on legal governance as his normal mode of operation (D 20–33). But the relation between sovereignty and dictatorship changed in the French revolution. The revolutionary governments relied heavily on dictatorial action to create a new situation of normality that would allow a new constitution to come into force. The revolutionary governments, like the absolutist sovereign, claimed the power to decide on the exception, but they did not claim to be sovereign. Rather, they claimed to exercise the authority to decide on the exception in the name of the French people, even while they were ruling the French people by the use of dictatorial methods (D 132–47). Sovereignty and dictatorship had become fused in the novel institution of sovereign dictatorship: A sovereign dictator is a dictator who does not defend an already existing constitution but attempts to create a new one and who does so not by his own authority but in the name of the people (D 112–31). Sovereign dictatorship, in Schmitt’s view, is an eminently democratic institution. It can exist only where it has become possible to take a sovereign decision on the exception in the name of the people. Sovereignty, Schmitt concludes, is not just compatible with democracy but central to it, as it is exercised whenever and wherever a democratic constitution is founded (CT 109–10, 265–6; CPD 32). The fact that a democratic constitution cannot endow a particular person with permanent sovereign authority does not entail that the possibility of a genuine sovereign decision on the exception has disappeared. It merely implies that a decision on the exception in the democratic state must take the form of an exercise of the people’s constituent power. The sovereign dictator has the power, in taking the decision on the exception, to set aside the positive legal and constitutional order in its entirety and to create a novel positive legal and constitutional order, together with a situation of social normality that fits it. It follows that the sovereign dictator cannot base his claim to be acting in the name of the people on any kind of formal authorization. If the old constitution no longer exists and the new one is not yet in force, there is no formal procedure for generating a public will. And yet, the sovereign dictator claims to exercise the constituent power of the people. What is more, the constitutional order he is to create is to be considered as legitimate since it rests on the people’s right to give itself a constitution (CT 136–9). Schmitt’s view assumes that it is possible to speak of the existence of a people in advance of the creation of any positive constitutional framework. Schmitt therefore has to explain what it means for a people to exist prior to any constitutional framework, and he has to give an account of how the people’s political existence prior to any constitutional framework can ground a sovereign dictatorship. Schmitt’s The Concept of the Political phrases the answer to this question as an account of the nature of ‘the political.’ (Sartori 1989; Gottfried 1990, 57–82; Meier 1998; Hofmann 2002, 94–116; Mehring 2003; Kennedy 2004, 92–118; Slomp 2009, 21–37; Schupmann 2017, 69–105) Schmitt famously claims that “the specific political distinction … is that between friend and enemy.” (CP 26) The distinction between friend and enemy, Schmitt elaborates, is essentially public and not private. Individuals may have personal enemies, but personal enmity is not a political phenomenon. Politics involves groups that face off as mutual enemies (CP 28–9). Two groups will find themselves in a situation of mutual enmity if and only if there is a possibility of war and mutual killing between them. The distinction between friend and enemy thus refers to the “utmost degree of intensity … of an association or dissociation.” (CP 26, 38) The utmost degree of association is the willingness to fight and die for and together with other members of one’s group, and the ultimate degree of dissociation is the willingness to kill others for the simple reason that they are members of a hostile group (CP 32–3). Schmitt believes that political enmity can have many different origins. The political differs from other spheres of value in that it is not based on a substantive distinction of its own. The ethical, for example, is based on a distinction between the morally good and the morally bad, the aesthetic on a distinction between the beautiful and the ugly, and the economical on a distinction between the profitable and the unprofitable. The political distinction between friend and enemy is not reducible to these other distinctions or, for that matter, to any particular distinction — be it linguistic, ethnic, cultural, religious, etc. — that may become a marker of collective identity and difference (CP 25–7). It is possible, for instance, to be enemies with members of a hostile group whom one judges to be morally good. And it is equally possible not to be engaged in a relationship of mutual enmity with a group whose individual members one judges to be bad. The same holds, Schmitt thinks, for all other substantive distinctions that may become markers of identity and difference. This is not to say, however, that one’s conception of moral goodness or badness, for instance, will never play a role in a relationship of political enmity. Any distinction that can serve as a marker of collective identity and difference will acquire political quality if it has the power, in a concrete situation, to sort people into two opposing groups that are willing, if necessary, to fight against each other (CP 37–8). Whether a particular distinction will come to play this role is not determined by its own intrinsic significance but by whether a group of people relies on it to define its own collective identity and comes to think of that identity, as based on that distinction, as something that might have to be defended against other groups by going to war. Since the political is not tied to any particular substantive distinction, Schmitt argues, it is naïve to assume that the political will disappear once conflicts arising from a particular distinction no longer motivate opposing groups to fight. Political identification is likely to latch on to another distinction that will inherit the lethal intensity of political conflict (See ND). But wherever a distinction has political quality, it will be the decisive distinction and the community constituted by it will be the decisive social unit. Since the political community is the social unit that can dispose of people’s lives, it will be able, where it exists, to assert its superiority over all other social groups within its confines and to rule out violent conflict among its members (CP 37–45). Schmitt claims that one cannot judge, from an external perspective, that a group is morally unjustified in defining its own identity in a certain way and to introduce political enmity, with the attendant possibility of killing, to preserve that identity. Only members of a group are in a position to decide, from the perspective of an existentially affected participant, whether the otherness of another group amounts to a threat to their own form of life and thus potentially requires to be fought (CP 27; See also CT 76–7, 136). Schmitt’s reasoning implicitly relies on a collectivist version of the logic of self-defence. The decision whether someone else’s behaviour constitutes a threat to one’s own life, in some concrete situation, and the decision whether it is necessary to use reactive or even pre-emptive violence to remove or to escape that threat, cannot be delegated to a third person. A group that perceives its own existence to be threatened by some other group, Schmitt argues, finds itself in an analogous position. The possibility of third-party mediation is therefore ruled out in a truly political conflict (CP 45–53). A political community exists, then, wherever a group of people are willing to engage in political life by distinguishing themselves from outsiders through the drawing of a friend-enemy distinction (CP 38, 43–4). A group’s capability to draw the distinction between friend and enemy does not require, Schmitt holds, that the group already possess a formal organization allowing for rule-governed collective decision-taking. A people, thus, will have an existence prior to all legal form as long as there is a sense of shared identity strong enough to motivate its members to fight and die for the preservation of the group. And as long as a people exists in this way it is capable, through its support, to sustain a sovereign dictatorship exercised in its name (CT 126–35). Of course, Schmitt’s analogy between the collective and the individual interest in self-preservation papers over an important difference between the two cases. A political community does not enjoy simple biological existence. It might die though all of its individual members continue to live. The drawing of a friend-enemy distinction, therefore, is never a mere reaction to a threat to a form of existence that is already given (but see Mouffe 1999, 49–50). Rather, it actively constitutes the political identity or existence of the people and determines who belongs to the people. To belong one must identify with the substantive characteristic, whatever it may be, that marks the identity of the people, and one must agree that this characteristic defines a form of life for the preservation of which one ought to be willing to sacrifice one’s own life, in the fight against those who don’t belong (CP 46). Schmitt realizes, of course, that it is possible for people who are not willing to identify in this way to be legally recognized as citizens, and to live law-abidingly, under the norms authorized by some positive constitution. Liberal states, in Schmitt’s view, have a tendency to fail to distinguish properly between friends and enemies, and thus to extend rights of membership to those who do not truly belong to the political nation. In a liberal state, Schmitt fears, the political nation will slowly whither and die as a result of spreading de-politicization, it will succumb to internal strife, or it will be overwhelmed by external enemies who are more politically united (CP 69–79; L 31–77). To avert these dangers, Schmitt suggests, it is necessary to make sure that the boundaries of the political nation and the boundaries of citizenship coincide. This demand explains Schmitt’s claim, in the first sentence of The Concept of the Political, that the concept of the state presupposes the concept of the political (CP 19). The point of this remark is that a state can only be legitimate if its legal boundaries embody a clear friend-enemy distinction. In order to achieve this aim, Schmitt clearly implies, a sovereign dictator, acting in the interstices between two periods of positive constitutional order, must homogenize the community by appeal to a clear friend-enemy distinction, as well as through the suppression, elimination, or expulsion of internal enemies who do not endorse that distinction (CP 46–8). In so doing, the sovereign dictator expresses the community’s understanding of what is normal or exceptional and of who belongs, and he creates the homogeneous medium that Schmitt considers to be a precondition of the legitimate applicability of law. Schmitt observes that his concept of the political is not belligerent. It does not glorify war, but merely claims that a community that is interested in living politically needs to be willing to go to war if it perceives its political existence to be threatened (CP 32–5). But the intended analogy with self-defence seems to make little moral sense, given that Schmitt’s conception of political existence demands the active elimination of those whom a majority perceives as internal enemies, and even celebrates that elimination as the essential activity of the popular sovereign. Schmitt’s understanding of the political provides the basis for his critique of liberalism (Holmes 1993, 37–60; McCormick 1997; Dyzenhaus 1997, 58–70; Kahn 2011). On a descriptive level, Schmitt claims that liberalism has a tendency to deny the need for genuine political decision, to suggest that it is neither necessary nor desirable for individuals to form groups that are constituted by the drawing of friend-enemy distinctions. Liberals believe that there are no conflicts among human beings that cannot be solved to everyone’s advantage through an improvement of civilization, technology, and social organization or be settled, after peaceful deliberation, by way of amicable compromise. As a result, liberalism is unable to provide substantive markers of identity that can ground a true political decision. Liberal politics, consequently, boils down to the attempt to domesticate the polity, in the name of the protection of individual freedom, but it is unable to constitute political community in the first place (CP 69–79; CPD 33–50). If this is a correct account of the character of liberal ideology and of the aims of liberal politics, Schmitt is right to conclude that liberalism has a tendency to undermine a community’s political existence, as he understands it. But in order for this observation to amount to a critique of liberalism, Schmitt needs to explain why a liberal subversion of the political would be undesirable. Schmitt’s political works contain a number of rather different answers to this question. A first line of thought emphasizes, with appeal to Hobbes, that a state can only be legitimate as long as it retains the capacity to offer protection to its members (for Schmitt’s engagement with Hobbes see McCormick 1994; Tralau 2011; and Schmitt’s L; SM; VR). And a state that has suffered a subversion of the political, induced by liberal ideology, Schmitt argues, will be unable to offer protection to its members, because it will fail to protect them from the indirect rule of pluralist interest-groups that have successfully colonized the state (LL 17–36, L 65–77) and, more importantly, because it will lack the power to protect them from external enemies (CP 51–3). If a people is no longer willing to decide between friend and enemy the most likely result will not be eternal peace but anarchy or subjection to another group that is still willing to assume the burdens of the political. This first answer, however, is not Schmitt’s last word on why liberal de-politicization is undesirable. Schmitt seems to admit that a global hegemon might one day be able to enforce a global de-politicization, by depriving all other communities of the capacity to draw their own friend-enemy distinctions, or that liberalism might one day attain global cultural hegemony, such that people will no longer be interested in drawing friend-enemy distinctions (CP 35, 57–8). Schmitt, then, cannot rest his case against liberal de-politicization on the claim that it is an unrealistic goal. He needs to argue that it is undesirable even if it could be achieved (Strauss 2007). Schmitt replies to this challenge that a life that does not involve the friend-enemy distinction would be shallow, insignificant, and meaningless. A completely de-politicized world would offer human beings no higher purpose than to increase their consumption and to enjoy the frolics of modern entertainment. It would reduce politics to a value-neutral technique for th e provision of material amenities. As a result, there would no longer be any project or value that individuals are called upon to serve, whether they want to or not, and that can give their life a meaning that transcends the satisfaction of private desires (CP 35, 57–8; RK 21–7; PR 109–62; WS 85–108). But that a world in which one does not have the opportunity to transcend one’s interest in individual contentment in the service of a higher value would be shallow and meaningless does not suffice to establish that a willingness to kill or to die for a political community will confer meaning on a life, much less that it is the only thing that can do so. When Schmitt claims that the defence of the political is the only goal that could possibly justify the killing of others and the sacrifice of one’s own life (CP 35; 48–9) he assumes without argument that the life of political community, as he understands it, is uniquely and supremely valuable. Some interpreters have explained Schmitt’s hostility towards liberal de-politicization as being grounded in the view that a willingness to distinguish between friend and enemy is a theological duty (Mehring 1989; Meier 1998; Groh, 1991; Herrero 2015, 143–177; Vatter 2016). Schmitt argues in Political Theology that all key concepts of the modern doctrine of the state are secularized theological concepts, which suggests that a political theory that continues to use these concepts needs a theological foundation (PT 36–52). In The Concept of the Political, Schmitt claims that all true political theorists base their views on a negative anthropology which holds that man is by nature evil and licentious, and thus needs to be kept in check by a strong state capable of drawing a friend-enemy distinction if there is to be social order (CP 58–68). This latter thesis, Schmitt admits, can take a secular form, as in Hobbes or Machiavelli, as the purely descriptive claim that man is inherently dangerous to man. But Schmitt suggests that this secular version of a negative political anthropology is open to be transformed into the view that man, though by nature dangerous, is perfectible or into the view that man’s dangerous behavior is a mere contingent consequence of a mistaken form of social organization (PT 53–66; L 31–9). In order to establish a permanent need for political authority, negative political anthropology must be given a theological reading that portrays the dangerous nature of man as an irrevocable result of original sin. Liberal de-politicization, from this perspective, is to be rejected as a sign of human pride that rebels against God, who alone, but only at the end of history, can deliver humanity from political enmity. Schmitt himself admits that the theological grounding of politics is based on an anthropological confession of faith (CP 58). And one is tempted to say that Schmitt’s theory turns out to be philosophically irrelevant if this is really the last word. Schmitt would likely have replied that the liberal assumption that man is perfectible, that humanity can overcome political enmity, and that to do so is desirable, is also an article of faith. The theological partisan of the political, in Schmitt’s view, is as justified in practicing his creed as the liberal cosmopolitan and to engage in a deliberate cultivation of political enmity (CPD 65–76). As long as the political theologian can make sure that the friend-enemy distinction survives, liberals will be forced to enter the arena of the political and to go to war against the partisans of the political. And this fight, Schmitt hopes, is going to secure the continuing existence of political enmity and prevent the victory of liberal de-politicization (CP 36–7). Schmitt’s conception of politics tends to radically dissociate democracy from liberalism and, more controversially, from the constituted, rule-bound practices of popular election and parliamentary legislation that characterize the ordinary workings of modern democracy. How, then, did Schmitt apply his radical perspective to the sphere of constituted democratic politics in the Weimar Republic? (Valuable overviews in Dyzenhaus 1997; Kennedy 2004; Neumann 2015, 77–304; Preuss 2016.) In The Crisis of Parliamentary Democracy, Schmitt understands democracy as the self-rule of the people. In a democratic polity, the decisions taken by the rulers express the will of the people (CPD 25–6). However, the principle of democracy, taken in the abstract, is open to different and competing interpretations. In political practice, the identity of the ruling will with the will of the people is never a simple given. Rather, it is always the result of an act of identification. When political decisions are taken through majority vote, the will of the majority is identified with the will of the people, and every citizen is expected to obey regardless of whether he voted with the majority (CPD 26–30). But what, Schmitt asks, is the basis of this identification? If a majority can overrule a minority, and identify its will with the will of the people, why should it not be possible for the will of a minority to express the will of the people? What if a group of democratic revolutionaries want to establish a democracy in a society where most people are opposed to the principle of democracy? Would they not be justified, from a democratic point of view, to abandon majority rule, to identify their own will with the true will of the people, and to subject their compatriots to a re-educative dictatorship? Schmitt suggests that such a dictatorship would still have to be considered democratic, since it still appeals to the idea that political rule ought to be based on the will of the people (CPD 28–30). Once one accepts this claim, the conclusion that Schmitt aims to establish in The Crisis of Parliamentary Democracy will follow: The electoral institutions that we usually take to be paradigmatically democratic are not, in truth, any more intimately connected with the principle of democracy than a dictatorship in the name of the people. The latter was to be legitimated by plebiscites, initiated by a charismatic leader, in which the people, Schmitt argued, should be allowed to give or withhold approval, but never to initiate the question (CPD 32; VV). But this conclusion must surely be an overstatement. Even democratic dictatorship, however crucial to the establishment of democracy, is exceptional and limited in time. Hence, there must be a characteristically democratic condition of legal normality, and a theory of democracy should tell us what it is. Schmitt’s apparent attempt to dissociate the idea of democracy from any particular method of will-formation fails to explain why the democratic tradition has considered institutional provisions like the election of officials or the extension of the franchise to be characteristically democratic. Schmitt acknowledges this problem in his Constitutional Theory. The idea that legitimate political rule must make appeal to the will of the people, Schmitt now claims, is grounded in the value of political equality (CT 255–67). Political equality commits us to the denial of natural differences in status among citizens. Per se, no citizen has more of a right than any other citizen else to hold political power. Every citizen, therefore, should participate on equal terms, as far as practically feasible, in the exercise of political rule. What is more, where it is necessary to appoint public officials with special powers not shared by all citizens, these officials must be appointed through periodical elections. The value of political equality, then, explains why certain forms of will formation are considered to be more intimately associated with the idea of democracy than others (CT 280–5). However, Schmitt’s concession to the value of equality comes with a twist. The political equality that constitutes a political community, Schmitt argues, cannot be based on the non-exclusive equality of all human beings as moral persons. Every political community is based on a constitutive distinction between insiders and outsiders or friends and enemies. A democratic political community, as much as any other, must therefore rest on some marker of identity and difference that can ground an exclusive form of political equality which will only apply to insiders (CT 257–64). Schmitt goes on to define democracy as a political system characterized by the identity of ruler and ruled. Ruler and ruled are identical if and only if the rulers and all the ruled share the substantive identity that the community as a whole, in deciding who its enemies are, has chosen to turn into the basis of its political identity (CT 264–7; See also CPD 8–17). If all those who live together as legally recognized citizens of a constituted democratic state happen to distinguish between friend and enemy in exactly the same way, the equal participation of all citizens in the political process and the electoral appointment of officials would indeed be a requirement of democratic political justice. It would be possible, moreover, to identify the outcomes of the political process with the will of the people, and to consider them democratically legitimate, even if some citizens find themselves in a temporary minority. But the reason why it has become possible to identify the outcomes of democratic procedure with the will of the people is not to be sought in inherent virtues of democratic procedure itself. Rather, the identification is possible only in virtue of the prior identity of all citizens as members of a group constituted by a shared friend-enemy distinction (CPD 10–14; LL 27–28). If, contrary to our initial assumption, those who live together as legally recognized citizens of a constituted democratic state do not share a political identity in Schmitt’s sense, the identity of the rulers with all the ruled will no longer obtain, and the constituted democratic state will no longer be truly democratic. The rule of the majority will degenerate into an illegitimate form of indirect rule of one social faction over another (HV 73–91; LL 17–36; L 65–77). Sovereign dictatorship, then, is still necessary to create the substantive equality that grounds the legitimate operation of constituted, rule-governed democratic politics. The understanding of democracy so far outlined informs Schmitt’s interpretation of the Weimar constitution (Dyzenhaus 1997, 38–101; Caldwell 1997, 85–119; Scheuerman 1999, 61–84; Hofmann 2002, 117–52; Kennedy 2004, 119–53; Neumann 2015, 77–304; Preuss 2016; Schupmann 2017). A democratic constitution, Schmitt argues in his Constitutional Theory, is the product of an exercise of constituent power on the part of a politically united people (CT 75–77, 125–30, 140–6). The creation of a democratic constitution must not be thought of along the lines of a social contract, since it presupposes the prior existence of a people as a political unity, as explicated in the Concept of the Political (CT 112–3; Böckenförde 1998). If the people did not already exist, Schmitt reasons, it would not be able to give itself a constitution, and a constitution not given by the people itself to itself would not be a democratic constitution. In giving itself a constitution a politically united people determines the concrete form of its political existence, but it does not bring itself into existence. Since a democratic constitution is a unilateral determination, on the part of an already existing people, of the concrete form of its political existence, the people’s constituent power must be inalienable. As long as a people exists it can always decide to give itself a new constitution (CT 140–1). Schmitt’s theory of constituent power has recently received a lot of attention from authors who believe it might help to reinvigorate constituted democracy (Kalyvas 2008, 79–186; Colon-Rios 2012). Schmitt recognizes that it would be implausible to assume that a written constitution represents a conscious choice of the popular sovereign down to its last detail. The revolution of the German people in 1918 that led to the creation of the Weimar constitution, for example, expressed the German people’s conscious decision for a democratic, republican, and federal state, committed to the principles of the rule of law, and endowed with a parliamentary system of legislation and government (CT 77–8). But in addition to these general principles of political and social order, the Weimar constitution came to contain a large number of specific provisions that do not reflect conscious decisions of the popular sovereign (CT 82–8). Schmitt argues that it would be wrong to treat such particular constitutional norms as possessing the same normative force as the people’s decision for a concrete form of political existence, which is expressed in the basic principles implicit in the constitution. It is wrong, therefore, to regard a constitution as nothing more than the set of all particular constitutional norms, and to assume that all these norms are equally subject to constitutional amendment. Even where, as in Weimar, the positive constitution provides a procedure that seems to allow for the amendment of any particular constitutional norm, it is to be understood, Schmitt argues, that the core constitutional principles chosen by the constituent power are not open to formal abrogation. To claim that they are is to advocate a usurpation of the constituent power of the people by a mere party or faction (CT 77–82, 147–58). Schmitt thinks that this argument will hold even where an initiative to amend the constitution requires a supermajority. Political decision-taking on the basis of the simple majority rule is legitimate only if citizens share a political identity, in which case they will also agree on a set of constitutional fundamentals. Where they don’t, the identity of ruler and all ruled no longer obtains, and majority rule will consequently become a mere license for the oppression of those who happen to be in the minority. Such oppression, Schmitt argues, does not become any more legitimate where a super-majoritarian requirement is raised and met. That a numerical majority is relatively large and a numerical minority is relatively small does not entail, once there is no longer a shared political identity, that we are any closer to an identity between the ruler and all the ruled than in the case of a simple majority (LL 39–58). Schmitt concludes that it would be absurd to take the view that the formal procedures of amendment provided by a democratic constitution can legitimately be used to overturn its constitutional fundamentals (LL 85–94). Before 1933, Schmitt employed this argument to oppose a Nazi seizure of power (Machtergreifung) in legal form (Bendersky 1983, 107–91). It should also be noted that his claim that there must be limits to constitutional amendment in a democratic constitution based on the principle of popular sovereignty, and that these limits legitimate the notion of a ‘militant democracy’ that is willing to curb individual rights to defend itself, has been very influential in postwar constitutional thought, in Germany and elsewhere (see Ehmke 1953, 33–53; Fox and Nolte 1995, 18–20; Conrad 1999; Colon-Rios 2012, 126–51). However, Schmitt’s constitutional theory did not amount to an unqualified defence of liberal democracy. While Schmitt denies the possibility of changing the fundamental nature of an established constitution from within, and decries the dangers of the tyranny of a mere numerical majority, he nevertheless affirms the possibility of fundamental constitutional change through sovereign dictatorship, and he makes it clear that the German people, in a renewed exercise of their constituent power, might legitimately choose a non-liberal and non-parliamentarian form of democracy (CT 75–7). The exclusionary nature of the friend-enemy distinction that is to be enforced through extra-legal sovereign dictatorship, to provide a basis for the normal functioning of the constitutional order, throws further doubt on the democratic nature of Schmitt’s constitutional theory (see Kraft–Fuchs 1930; Vinx 2013a). Schmitt’s ambiguous position towards the Weimar system was equally on display in his interpretation of the dictatorial powers of the president of the Weimar Republic under art. 48 of the Weimar constitution (Dyzenhaus 1997, 70–85; Vinx 2016). By partially assimilating the president to a sovereign dictator, Schmitt defended an unusually extensive interpretation of the president’s authority that in effect subjected all constitutional rights to the discretionary interference of the executive headed by the president (See DP). Liberal rights were to be respected, as the German people had chosen to create a liberal constitution, but only on the condition that public order and security had been secured. For Schmitt, individual freedoms, even where constitutionally guaranteed, are to be regarded as concessions of the state to the individual since they are subject, in the last instance, to suspension through a sovereign decision on the exception (CT 80–1, 156–8, 235–52). Schmitt, moreover, vehemently fought against the idea that the protection of the constitution ought to be assigned to a constitutional court. A constitutional court, Schmitt argued, would either have to limit itself to uncontroversial cases in which constitutional law provides determinate guidance or take upon itself the responsibility to determine the political identity of the people. But for a court to assume that responsibility would, in Schmitt’s view, have amounted to an illegitimate usurpation of the constituent power of the people, as much as an attempt to bring about fundamental constitutional change through formal constitutional amendment (HV 12–48; TV 26–41). Schmitt apparently hoped, throughout the Weimar Republic’s years of relative stability, that presidential dictatorship in defence of the existing constitution might be sufficient to create a condition of normality that would allow the Weimar Republic to function. But this hope was disappointed in the final crisis of the Weimar Republic. Schmitt’s writings during that crisis started to toy with the view that the president should attempt to assume a role much closer to full sovereign dictatorship than even Schmitt’s own interpretation of art. 48 would have permitted and to engineer an authoritarian transformation of the positive constitution (LL 85–94). This project failed when the Nazis managed to take power through the kind of abuse of constitutional procedure that Schmitt had warned against (Kennedy 2004, 154–83). After a very brief period of hesitation Schmitt nevertheless offered his services as a legal advisor to the Nazis. He was careful to emphasize that the Machtergreifung amounted to a true revolution, despite its seemingly legal form, to maintain consistency with his view that a constitution cannot undergo fundamental change through formal amendment (SBV 5–9), but he was quick to translate his identitarian theory of democracy into the racialist idiom preferred by the Nazis (SBV 32–46) and started to advocate an institutionalist theory of law that was supposed to take its bearings from the authentic form of life of the German people (TJT 47–57, 89–95). Schmitt himself presented this shift as a fundamental reorientation of his legal-theoretical approach from a ‘decisionist’ perspective to ‘concrete order thought’. It is doubtful, however, whether the term ‘concrete order’ designates more than the situation of normality that Schmitt had always taken to be the basis of determinate legality. His claim (or hope) was simply that the Nazis have successfully restored normality (but see Croce and Salvatore 2013, 11–76). The national socialist movement, in Schmitt’s view, had managed to orchestrate an exercise of constituent power and to create a new constitution; one that was willing to draw uncompromising distinctions between the German people and its internal and external enemies. Given this description of the Machtergreifung, Schmitt’s political and constitutional theory seems to imply that Hitler’s rule was perfectly legitimate. It therefore seems unnecessary to postulate a radical discontinuity between Schmitt’s views before and after 1933 (Dyzenhaus 1997, 82–101; Mauss 1998; Scheuerman 1999, 113–39; Hofmann 2002, 152–88). Schmitt’s conception of the political grounds a distinctive interpretation of democracy and constitutionalism in the domestic sphere. It led Schmitt to an equally distinctive account of the foundations of international legality that has received increasing scholarly attention in recent years (Scheuerman 1999, 141–73; Scheuerman 2006; Odysseos and Petito 2007; Axtmann 2007; Hooker 2009; Slomp 2009; Legg 2011; Benhabib 2012; Neumann 2015, 419–492; Koskenniemi 2016; Hathaway and Shapiro 2017; Kalyvas 2018). Schmitt is a staunch defender of sovereignty, but he does not embrace a flat rejection of international legality. Rather, Schmitt appears concerned to outline the conditions under which sovereign political communities, with differing political identities, can co-exist in a shared international legal order. Two important consequences for international theory of Schmitt’s conception of politics are immediately obvious. First, it implies that every true political community must claim a legally unrestricted ius ad bellum. If the distinction between friend and enemy that constitutes a group’s political existence is not drawn by the group itself but by someone else, or if the decision whether to go to war in a concrete situation is no longer taken by the group but by some third party — be it a hegemonic state, an international organization, or an international court — the group no longer exists as an independent political community (CP 45–53). The second key consequence of Schmitt’s conception of politics for international theory follows from the claim that the political existence of a group must be based on a particular identity that serves as the substance of a friend-enemy distinction. Such an identity, of course, must differ from the identity of any other political community for the group in question to achieve a political identity of its own. It would be impossible for there to be a plurality of political communities — and hence, since political community is only possible where a group has enemies, for there to be any political community — if there were only one legitimate form of social organization or communal life (CP 53–8). These two consequences of Schmitt’s conception of politics imply two conditions of the legitimacy of international order, at least if one makes the assumption, with Schmitt, that political communities have an unconditional right to preserve their existence (CP 48–9; CT 75–7). Given this assumption, a legitimate international order must be able to accommodate a plurality of political communities with different, self-determined political identities. What is more, it must recognize as legitimate the ius ad bellum claimed by all groups that have successfully constituted themselves as political communities. A conception of international order that violates any of these two conditions would be incompatible with political existence and therefore illegitimate. These demands on legitimate international order seem to be a recipe for anarchy. Would it not have been better for Schmitt to admit that his view implies a denial of international legal order? Schmitt’s reply to this objection is twofold. On the one hand, he argues that there is at least one historical instance of a functioning international order that lived up to his criteria of legitimacy. On the other hand, Schmitt claims that the attempt to subject the use of force on the part of political communities to external legal constraint and control, apart from constituting an assault on the possibility of political existence, will only lead to greater disorder and violence than we can expect to experience in a system that recognizes the political. Schmitt’s first reply is based on an interpretation of the nature of European political order in the period from the establishment of the modern sovereign state to the beginning of WWI. In Schmitt’s account, this period was not a period of mere anarchy. Rather, it was characterized by the existence of a public law governing the relations between European states, the ius publicum Europaeum (NE 140–212). The main pillar of the ius publicum Europaeum, according to Schmitt, was a strict separation between the ius ad bellum and the ius in bello. On the level of ius ad bellum, all independent states were recognized to possess the right to go to war on the basis of their own judgment of justice and necessity. The legal order of ius publicum Europaeum, in effect, did not distinguish between just and unjust war. Rather, both sides in a conflict between sovereign states were by default recognized as legitimate belligerents (NE 140–71). Moreover, since both states in any conflict were held to be legitimate belligerents, states not directly involved in a conflict were taken to possess the right to choose to back either side or to remain neutral (DCW 53–74). This framework, Schmitt argues, allowed European states to bring about a highly effective containment of the negative consequences of war, and thus of the dangers of political existence. The abstraction from the justice of war allowed states to make peace without being hampered by the need to apportion moral blame. The freedom to side with either party in a conflict, or else to remain neutral, allowed states to contain conflicts by balancing or simply by staying out of the fight. Most importantly, however, the mutual recognition of legitimate belligerency allowed for the effective enforcement of stringent constraints on the permissible means of warfare on the level of ius in bello. Inter-statal warfare during the period of the jus publicum Europaeum, according to Schmitt, distinguished carefully between combatants and civilians and abstained from using methods of warfare that might endanger the lives or the property of civilians (NE 142–43, 165–8). This containment of war, Schmitt claims, was premised on the willingness to bracket the question of justice on the level of ius ad bellum. Once one takes the view that a war can be legitimate on one side, while being illegitimate on the other, one is forced to conclude, Schmitt argues, that it is morally wrong to grant the status of legitimate belligerency to those who are judged to fight without a just cause, and equally wrong to assume that they ought to enjoy the same in bello-rights as those who fight justly (NE 320–2; CP 54–7). Moreover, once one separates between legitimate and illegitimate belligerency, it will no longer be possible to argue that other states have the right to side with either belligerent or to remain neutral. Rather, third parties will be seen to have a duty to side with those who fight justly (DK 26–53). The abandonment of the idea that all participants in a war among states are equally legitimate belligerents, Schmitt concludes, inevitably undercuts the containment of war achieved in ius publicum Europaeum (PB 286–90). Unsurprisingly, Schmitt rejected the project of creating an international legal order based on a ‘discriminating concept of war’ that would subject the use of force on the part of sovereign states to substantive criteria of moral legitimacy and external legal control. He regarded such developments as little more than attempts on the part of the victorious western allies to brand any violent German effort to revise the outcomes of WWI as illegal and thus as unjust, and to give themselves license for the application of means of coercion and for the use of methods of warfare that would have been considered as illegitimate in the context of mutually legitimate belligerency (PB 184–203; NE 259–80). Schmitt argued that international legalization on the model of just war theory would not prevent coming wars. It would merely make them more total, as it would encourage opponents to regard each other as absolute enemies worthy of elimination (NE 309–22; Brown 2007; Slomp 2009, 95–111). However, Schmitt acknowledged that the era of ius publicum Europaeum had come to an end after WWI, together with the global hegemony of the classical European concert of sovereign states (GO 101–11). Schmitt therefore aimed to assess the chances for the emergence of a new global order analogous in structure to ius publicum Europaeum and he made an attempt, in The Nomos of the Earth, to explicate the presuppositions of the kind of international order exemplified by ius publicum Europaeum. For it to be possible for groups that are related by enmity nevertheless to co-exist in a shared framework which limits the consequences of war mutual enmity must be prevented from reaching the level of absolute enmity. Enmity, even while it may require one to defend one’s own political existence against the enemy, must not require the complete destruction of the enemy’s political and perhaps of his physical existence. Ius publicum Europaeum, in Schmitt’s view, had been capable of preventing absolute enmity through an alignment of friend-enemy distinctions with territorial boundaries (Zarmanian 2006). If the forms of life of two opposed political communities are each tied to and expressed in a particular territory, then the two groups will be able, Schmitt argues, to spatialize the friend-enemy distinction between them (NE 42–9). From the point of view of any one of the two groups, the protection of its political existence will require it to repel any attempt on the part of the other group to dispossess it of its territory. But it will not require the one group to interfere with or to destroy the political existence of the other group if to do so is unnecessary for the protection of its own territory. All political conflicts, under such circumstances, can be reduced to territorial conflicts, and this entails that all conflicts can in principle be contained as long as it is possible to divide territory in a way that will allow both groups to maintain their form of life (NE 143–8). For political conflicts to be reducible to territorial conflicts, opposing political communities must of course accept the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other political communities. The reduction of political conflict to territorial conflict would be impossible if political allegiances were spread out across borders. If some of those who share the identity that we have made into the basis of our political life live in a territory controlled by another political community we will have to concern ourselves with their fate. If we perceive them to be oppressed by that other community, we may feel compelled to go to war for them, even if the other community has not aggressed against our own territory. To territorialize the friend-enemy distinction, hence, one must ensure that all and only the people who share the same political identity live in the same territory (GO 86–8, 96–101). Some political identities, however, do not lend themselves to a spatialization of the political. A community whose political identity is premised on the promotion of liberal-humanitarian values which it takes to be universal, for instance, must concern itself with the question whether other political communities respect those values and be willing to interfere if they don’t. It cannot accept a reduction of political conflict to territorial conflict, as its political identity purports to be non-exclusive. A global order on the model of ius publicum Europaeum will therefore remain unattainable, and a global civil war characterized by absolute enmity will be unavoidable, Schmitt concludes, as long as the world’s foremost powers are committed to universalist ideologies that imply a rejec tion of the spatialization of political conflict (GO 90–5; VA 375–85). As Schmitt would later point out in Theory of the Partisan, the distinction between absolute and contained enmity gives rise to a distinction between absolute, real, and conventional enemies (TP 85–95; see also CP 36–7; Slomp 2009, 112–26). A conventional enemy is an enemy within an established system of containment, whereas a real enemy is an enemy that can be made, though perhaps only after conflict, to settle for a territorial division. Absolute enmity, by contrast, exists wherever there is a conflict that is not amenable to territorial settlement. In Schmitt’s view, it is the powers who, for ideological reasons, refuse to accept a spatialization of conflict that are to blame for absolute enmity and the unbridled violence it entails. Those who are real enemies, but who need not be each other’s absolute enemies, then, have to find a way to recognize each other, to divide the world among themselves, and to hold down political forces that must reject the territorialization of political conflict. Schmitt’s The Nomos of the Earth, accordingly, portrayed the mutually recognized appropriation of the globe by mutually non-intervening, territorially-based political communities as the true foundation of all legitimate international (and thus of national) legal order (NE 42–9, 67–83; GO 77–9; see also Herrero 2015, 21–49). During the Nazi-period, Schmitt applied this view to a justification of Nazi-aggression, by portraying Nazi-Germany as a local hegemon willing to support a global territorial division based on a principle of non-intervention. Schmitt hoped, for a while at least, that America would reveal itself to be Germany’s ‘real enemy’ and that it would be willing to engage in a mutual division of spheres of influence. In this vein, Schmitt interpreted the Monroe-doctrine as the first act of hegemonic appropriation of a sphere of interest that might come to form part of a new global order, if only America were willing let Germany impose its own Monroe-doctrine on continental Europe (GO 83–90). For as long as they were militarily successful, Schmitt celebrated the Nazi wars as the birth pangs of a new ‘nomos of the earth.’ (LS section 20) Of course, Schmitt’s hopes were disappointed when the war, after catastrophic bloodshed, ended in a stalemate between two hegemonic powers that were both unwilling to repudiate universalist ideology, but nevertheless quite successful in preventing their own conflict from escalating into open war. Schmitt, though, did not question his claim that international order ought to be based on territorial division. It became fashionable in circles around Schmitt to refer to the cold war as a ‘global civil war’ (Müller 2003, 104–15) while Schmitt, in Theory of the Partisan, expressed his admiration of Mao’s and Ho Chi-minh’s partisans for exhibiting a “telluric” character and a “tie to the soil” while rejecting “world revolutionary or technicistic ideology.” (TP 20–2) The new order was still supposed to emerge from a distribution of the globe among internally homogenous peoples tied to a certain land. It should be obvious that Schmitt’s theory of the presuppositions of international order is closely related to his account of the conditions of well-functioning domestic legality (Vinx 2013b). The spatialization of conflict requires political communities strong enough to enforce internal political homogeneity. But political communities are unlikely to be able to enforce internal homogeneity if they have to live in an international environment that lacks a clear spatial order because it is controlled by powers that are ideologically hostile to the spatialization of conflict. Legitimate domestic order and legitimate international order, for Schmitt, are thus two sides of the same coin. Both require a defense of the political, as Schmitt understands it. (Axtmann 2007) Schmitt’s suggestion, however, that the preservation of the political as he understands it is a necessary condition of legitimate domestic and international legality seems rather hard to swallow in light of the catastrophic experiences of the 20th century. Schmitt was an acute observer and analyst of the weaknesses of liberal constitutionalism and liberal cosmopolitanism. But there can be little doubt that his preferred cure turned out to be infinitely worse than the disease. For full bibliographical information on Schmitt’s works see Alain de Benoist, Carl Schmitt.

"By Kyle Adams - April 29, 2011 A new WMUR Granite State Poll shows President Obama's approval rating in New Hampshire has reached a new low. According to the poll, conducted by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center, only 44 percent of New Hampshire adults surveyed approve of the president's job performance while 52 percent disapprove. In WMUR/UNH's last poll released in February, 46 percent approved of the president's job performance. This survey comes on the heels of several polls in other swing states showing increasing trouble for the president as he ramps up his re-election effort. Quinnipiac and Public Policy Polling (D) surveys in Pennsylvania showed the president's approval rating at 42 percent, and Suffolk University and Mason-Dixon polls in Florida showed his approval at 41 percent and 43 percent respectively. Compounding the president's problems in New Hampshire, a majority (57 percent) disapprove of his handling of the economy (only 40 percent approve). A majority, 52 percent, also disapprove of the health care reform legislation passed last year (the same number support repeal of the law) while 35 percent approve. Additionally, 63 percent think the country is headed in the wrong direction. In hypothetical 2012 general election matchups, the president trails former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, 50-43. However, he leads former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, 45-38, and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, 46-42. For this poll, the University of New Hampshire surveyed 520 New Hampshire adults between April 15-26. The margin of error is +/- 4.4 percent. Kyle Adams can be reached at kadams@.com.

"Military • Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz agrees with other war critics that time has come. By Thomas Burr And Matt Canham The Salt Lake Tribune This is an archived article that was published on .com in 2011, and information in the article may be outdated. It is provided only for personal research purposes and may not be reprinted. Washington • Now that Osama bin Laden is dead and his body buried at sea, war critics say the United States should begin withdrawing American troops from Afghanistan and refocusing the fight against terrorism. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, a Utah Republican, says the surgical strike on bin Laden's Pakistan compound Sunday vindicates Chaffetz' call two years ago for more human and electronic intelligence and fewer soldiers on the ground. ""One hundred thousand troops on the street corners of Afghanistan is not necessarily the way we protect the United States of America,"" Chaffetz said. ""Clearly, our war on terror is global in nature. It's not confined to the borders of Afghanistan and Pakistan."" Chaffetz, one of the House's most conservative members, finds himself allied with Rep. Barney Frank, a liberal Massachusetts Democrat, who called for pulling back U.S. troops during a speech Monday at the Center for American Progress Action Fund. ""We went there to get Osama bin Laden and we have now gotten Osama bin Laden,"" said Frank, who believes killing the al-Qaida leader should end complaints that leaving Afghanistan would mean leaving in defeat. President Barack Obama has already vowed to bring home some of the 100,000 troops in the central Asian country this summer, though he made clear Sunday night in announcing bin Laden's death that the fight continues. ""His death does not mark the end of our effort,"" Obama said. ""There's no doubt that al-Qaida will continue to pursue attacks against us. We must — and we will — remain vigilant at home and abroad."" Several U.S. leaders stressed that point on Monday as details emerged about the helicopter attack on bin Laden in Pakistan. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said bin Laden's death was a ""critical milestone"" but the war on terror was ""far from over"" and al-Qaida remains committed to global jihad. ""It's too soon to say what lasting impact Osama bin Laden's death will have on our military operations in Afghanistan and Pakistan,"" Hatch said. ""But one thing is clear, we know that this region remains highly unstable and sympathies and support for anti-American terrorism remains at disturbing levels. We cannot prematurely turn away from these two nations as we did after the Soviets retreated — creating a power vacuum that Osama bin Laden filled."" Rep. Rob Bishop, a Utah Republican on official leave from the House Armed Services Committee, says he doesn't believe bin Laden's death should have any short-term strategic impact, but could have lasting consequences down the road. ""This I don't think makes a difference in the tactical approach we need to take,"" Bishop said. ""It could be symbolic, and long-term it's going to make a difference in what happens. Hopefully it emboldens moderate Muslims against the terrorists who want to kill everybody."" House Intelligence Chairman Rep. Mike Rodgers, R-Mich., rejected the position of Chaffetz and Frank, saying that bin Laden's death should not lead to a military pullout from Afghanistan, particularly when U.S. forces have a chance to cripple the Taliban forces if fighting picks up as expected in the spring. He noted that the fight in Afghanistan wasn't just about al-Qaida but to oust the Taliban, which harbored terrorists such as bin Laden. ""For anyone to try to mix up this success with what I think will be a success here against the Taliban's spring offensive ... is making a serious mistake and jeopardizing the long-term health of our entire national security picture,"" Rodgers said. tburr@.com, mcanham@.com"
"We’re still seeing a flood of calls from both sides of the aisle to cut subsidies as part of an overall strategy to reduce spending in Washington. While there is plenty available to cut, there has been a steady and disingenuous conflation being promoted by the White House which seeks to describe certain tax benefits received by companies in all manner of industries as “subsidies for big oil.” Just last week Tim Pawlenty was taking to the stump in an attempt to call out these warped descriptions. MANCHESTER, N.H. – Former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty called a White House proposal to reduced tax breaks for oil companies “ludicrous” after a gathering of tea party activists. “I think we should have a discussion about all subsidies,” Mr. Pawlenty told Washington Wire at a forum for 2012 GOP presidential hopefuls. “But the Obama proposal is ludicrous. I mean the worst thing we could do is raise the cost burden on costs on energy and oil… What he’s proposing is a tax increase on energy at a time when the gas is $4 a gallon. It’s preposterous.” For those seeking to sort out the definitions of the terms being used, the American Petroleum Institute has published a new paper doing just that. Contrary to what some in politics and the media have said, the oil and natural gas industry currently enjoys no unique tax credits or deductions. Since its inception, the US tax code has allowed corporate tax payers the ability to recover costs and to be taxed only on net income. These cost recovery mechanisms, also known in policy circles as “tax expenditures”, should in no way be confused with “subsidies”, i.e., direct government spending. Here are a few of the items which are being incorrectly identified as “subsidies” inside the beltway: Intangible Drilling Costs – Companies which engage purely in energy exploration and discovery can recover their costs related to exploration at tax time at a rate of 100%. This lessens the burden on energy providers for the number of “dry holes” which may be found in the process. Integrated companies (i.e. “big oil”) can recover these exploration costs at 70%. Not a subsidy. Domestic Manufacturer’s Deduction (Section 199) – A deduction (not a credit) equal to 9% of income earned from manufacturing, producing, growing or extracting in the United States, is available to every single taxpayer who qualifies in the U.S. The oil and gas industry, and only the oil and gas industry, is limited to a 6% deduction. Percentage Depletion – The percentage depletion deduction is a cost recovery method that allows taxpayers to recover their lease investment in a mineral interest through a percentage of gross income from a well. This depletion method is not available to companies that produce oil as well as refine and market it (i.e. “Big Oil”.) This is available to all extractive industries (gold, iron, clay, etc) in the US and is in no way unique to the oil and gas industry. There are more, so download the paper and read them for yourself. Then, when you hear your congressman talking about all of the “subsidies” for big oil, you can set them straight based on the facts. To be clear, the federal government does engage in the handing out of a lot of actual subsidies, including those for ethanol and a variety of wasteful programs which are essentially failures on their own merit without feeding off the teat of Uncle Sam. And we should certainly be looking at those areas as way to address cost cutting. But trying to depict tax credits used by the energy industry – in the same fashion as every other industry – as some sort of special love festival for Big Oil is dishonest. "
"When people in Washington start creating fancy new phrases, instead of using plain English, you know they are doing something they don't want us to understand. It was an act of war when we started bombing Libya. But the administration chose to call it ""kinetic military action."" When the Federal Reserve System started creating hundreds of billions of dollars out of thin air, they called it ""quantitative easing"" of the money supply. When that didn't work, they created more money and called it ""quantitative easing 2"" or ""QE2,"" instead of saying: ""We are going to print more dollars-- and hope it works this time."" But there is already plenty of money sitting around idle in banks and businesses. The policies of this administration make it risky to lend money, with Washington politicians coming up with one reason after another why borrowers shouldn't have to pay it back when it is due, or perhaps not pay it all back at all. That's called ""loan modification"" or various other fancy names for welching on debts. Is it surprising that lenders have become reluctant to lend? Private businesses have amassed record amounts of cash, which they could use to hire more people-- if this administration were not generating vast amounts of uncertainty about what the costs are going to be for ObamaCare, among other unpredictable employer costs, from a government heedless or hostile toward business. As a result, it is often cheaper or less risky for employers to work the existing employees overtime, or to hire temporary workers, who are not eligible for employee benefits. But lack of money is not the problem. Those who are true believers in the old-time Keynesian economic religion will always say that the only reason creating more money hasn't worked is because there has not yet been enough money created. To them, if QE2 hasn't worked, then we need QE3. And if that doesn't work, then we will need QE4, etc. Like most of the mistakes being made in Washington today, this dogmatic faith in government spending is something that has been tried before-- and failed before. Henry Morgenthau, Secretary of the Treasury under President Franklin D. Roosevelt, said confidentially to fellow Democrats in 1939: ""We have tried spending money. We are spending more than we have ever spent before and it does not work."" As for the Federal Reserve today, a headline in the Wall Street Journal of April 25th said, ""Fed Searches for Next Step."" That is a big part of the problem. It is not politically possible for either the Federal Reserve or the Obama administration to leave the economy alone and let it recover on its own. Both are under pressure to ""do something."" If one thing doesn't work, then they have to try something else. And if that doesn't work, they have to come up with yet another gimmick. All this constant experimentation by the government makes it more risky for investors to invest or employers to employ, when neither of them knows when the government's rules of the game are going to change again. Whatever the merits or demerits of particular government policies, the uncertainty that such ever- changing policies generate can paralyze an economy today, just as it did back in the days of FDR. The idea that the federal government has to step in whenever there is a downturn in the economy is an economic dogma that ignores much of the history of the United States. During the first hundred years of the United States, there was no Federal Reserve. During the first one hundred and fifty years, the federal government did not engage in massive intervention when the economy turned down. No economic downturn in all those years ever lasted as long as the Great Depression of the 1930s, when both the Federal Reserve and the administrations of Hoover and of FDR intervened. The myth that has come down to us says that the government had to intervene when there was mass unemployment in the 1930s. But the hard data show that there was no mass unemployment until after the federal government intervened. Yet, once having intervened, it was politically impossible to stop and let the economy recover on its own. That was the fundamental problem then-- and now. .com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis. "
"In a story about the resurrection of the harsh interrogation techniques debate slated to run on The New York Times’ front page Wednesday morning, reporters Scott Shane and Charlie Savage completely ignore CIA director Leon Panetta’s Tuesday evening confirmation that waterboarding played a role in procuring the intelligence that led U.S. forces to terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden. “As intelligence officials disclosed the trail of evidence that led to the compound in Pakistan where Bin Laden was hiding, a chorus of Bush administration officials claimed vindication for their policy of ‘enhanced interrogation techniques’ like waterboarding,” Shane and Savage write in their story, accusing Republicans of igniting a debate they thought was long over. Shane and Savage looked the other way, though, when it came to Panetta’s confirmation that waterboarding was part of the “enhanced interrogation techniques” used on detainees. “We had multiple series of sources that provided information with regards to this situation… clearly some of it came from detainees [and] they used these enhanced interrogation techniques against some of those detainees,” Panetta told NBC News anchor Brian Williams. The New York Times duo also suggested that House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Rep. Peter King, New York Republican, inflamed the debate by saying he thought the intelligence came from waterboarding. “The chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, Representative Peter T. King, Republican of New York, told Fox News that the success of the hunt for Bin Laden was due to waterboarding,” Shane and Savage wrote. It turns out King was right. The duo’s story also wrongly reported the day of the attack on bin Laden’s complex in Pakistan. “Obama administration officials, intent on celebrating Monday’s successful raid, have tried to avoid reigniting a partisan battle over torture,” Shane and Savage wrote. The raid was conducted on Sunday, not Monday, as Shane and Savage reported. A spokesman for The New York Times did not immediately return The Daily Caller’s request for comment.

"Our results underscore the decisive relevance of cognitive ability—particularly of an intellectual class with high cognitive ability and accomplishments in science, technology, engineering, and math—for national wealth.""An intellectual class"" -- does that mean the U.S. is not doomed after all, since we'll still have an intellectual class with high cognitive ability despite the tidal wave of immigration from Central & So. Am.? India has had a distinct intellectual class (Brahmins) for thousands of years. But they weren't always interested in engineering and technology. I sometimes wonder where civilization would be today if all those generations of Brahmins had focused on science rather than yoga. It looks like La Griffe's smart fraction theory matters more for economic freedom than for STEM achievement.For STEM achievement, it doesn't matter if we set the threshold for ""smart"" at +1 or -1 s.d. -- the path coefficients are the same, 0.43 and 0.41.But for econ freedom, it makes a huge difference: the path coefficient shrinks from 0.65 to 0.06 when we choose the lower threshold for ""smart.""This fits with the historical picture where lots of earlier, pre-Flynn Effect societies had impressive pure and applied sciences, but not a lot in the way of market economics. Every culture has a smart fraction, but it matters what those smart people spend their time doing. Medieval Europe had an intellectual class that consisted mostly of church scholars, who devoted a lot of time and effort to crucial questions such as how many angels could dance on the head of a pin. Needless to say, that didn't lead to much wealth creation. Civilization didn't start to advance until intellectuals decided to stop wasting their time on arcane religious dogma and start studying nature in a scientific manner. ""Our results underscore the decisive relevance of cognitive ability—particularly of an intellectual class with high cognitive ability and accomplishments in science, technology, engineering, and math—for national wealth.""So we know who to blame then. Have we left Afghanistan yet? Actually, I'd bet that ""personality traits"" are even more important than IQ/intelligence in the economic success of a society, and these probably have a genetic as well as a cultural component.I think part of the problem is these can't be measured or quantified nearly as easily, and are also more vague and subjective in categorization. Furthermore, they can be ""faked"" or simulated without too much difficulty. It's easy for someone to pretend to be more honest than he really is to an interviewer. It's much harder to pretend to have a higher testable IQ than you really do... As far as moral responsibility:What if the effects of slave raiding included protein deficiency? Kwashioikor, or whatever you crazy kids are calling the kind of nutritional deficiency that makes everyone's foreheads cave in for lack of protein to grow a forebrain? Someone -- Michael Daisey I think -- recently described China as a fascist state run by thugs. True or not, China may yet prove that institutions and culture matter as much as brains and technology. I guess we'll see. Medieval Europe had an intellectual class that consisted mostly of church scholars, who devoted a lot of time and effort to crucial questions such as how many angels could dance on the head of a pin.Not true. Modern scholars of medieval technology recognize that the High Middle Ages were indeed a place where there was substantial material progress. The focus of that progress was the monastery.The Romans had mills near Arles and a few other places but in general they built very few labor savings devices. The medieval monastery however was organized around water mills. The only place in the entire world where there was a supply of non-muscle power was the monastery. Some call it the Medieval Industrial Revolution.Albertosaurus ""Medieval Europe had an intellectual class that consisted mostly of church scholars, who devoted a lot of time and effort to crucial questions such as how many angels could dance on the head of a pin.

"by Martin and Marcia The most recent double issue of the Claremont Review of Books contains an interesting essay by Richard Samuelson entitled Jefferson, Adams, and the American Future. It is adapted from a lecture by the author about these two unlikely friends. Samuelson points out that both men deserve the appellation of Founding Father, and to be considered as republicans with a small ‘r.’ And, there were other similarities as well, such as their participation in the formulation of their respective State governments. Adams drafted the Constitution for Massachusetts in 1779 and it was the first to be written and adopted by special convention and ratified by the people. Jefferson contributed his own constitution to Virginia, and while it was not accepted, many of his reforms were. However, it is their differences that make their friendship interesting. Samuelson points out, “At the root of the disagreement was a classic philosophical or even theological question: what is the cause of evil in the world?” Adams believed that, regardless of “enlightenment” and science, man was fundamentally an imperfect creature, subject to the same foibles as every generation that had gone before. Science was just another tool at the disposal of those in power, the same as wealth and family name had been from time immemorial. Jefferson believed that science acted as a great equalizer. No longer would physical attainments be sufficient for those who possessed them to dominate their fellows. In his mind, this gave power even to the physical weakling. Jefferson, like Paine thought they could now “begin the world anew.” He, like later Progressives, saw the evolution of man as one of perpetual improvement, culminating in a Utopian vision. Adams didn’t see things that way, “… I must esteem all the speculations of divines and philosophers about universal and perpetual peace as shortsighted, frivolous romances.” Similarly, they had different views on the meaning of history. Adams and Jefferson both employed the modern scientific method, but not in the same way. Jefferson selected facts from history to describe change over time, from a lower to a higher plane of existence. Adams, by contrast, was inclined to study the behavior of human beings in the same way modern scientists study the behavior of, say, ants. Rather than doing controlled experiments, however, his data set was historical. Drawing upon that data he discovered patterns. Wherever one found humans, one found certain things—governments, religion, families, private property, etc. From that data, one discovered general rules. These described human nature. Samuelson also contrasts the two men’s beliefs on the role of religion and their respective interpretations of the French Revolution. It is a fascinating essay that shows how the crux of their arguments continues even today. For example, the system of checks and balances in the new government that they each took a turn presiding over, Adam’s skepticism served to balance Jefferson’s optimism. Samuelson puts it this way: Progress was and remains difficult, but, thanks to Jefferson, it is enshrined as a goal of the American regime, even if, thanks to Adams, it is a chastened, and one hopes chastening, goal. Adams chastening is not much evident today, while Jefferson’s vision appears to be in ascendency. As Thomas Sowell explains in his book, The Vision of the Anointed, “The rise of the mass media, mass politics, and massive government means that the beliefs which drive a relatively small group of articulate people have great leverage in determining the course taken by a whole society.” Sowell goes on to explain the corollary to that leverage is that the assumptions underlying the prevailing vision are rarely questioned. Empirical evidence is ignored or denied as not merely being wrong, but as being immoral. Critics are demonized as racist, uncaring, irresponsible, or worse. The deleterious results of the welfare state, the scientific weaknesses of global warming, the disasters of central planning, have all been amply demonstrated, but have not caused the articulate elites to waver. The danger of the Jeffersonian vision, of course, is that if man is capable of perfection, all that is needed is for the smartest among us to find ways to perfect him. The point being that such a vision knows no bounds. It is antithetical to liberty. It always results in the application of force, whether through government fiat, or worse. John Adams said it best. “It is weakness rather than wickedness which renders man unfit to be trusted with unlimited power.” 2 comments And to think Jefferson thought man was improving, heading for utopia. Since there has been Mao, Stalin, Hitler, Castro and Pot just to name a few. Look at America. It’s not getting better. And, it’s not getting better, because its people aren’t getting better. They are voluntarily letting this government corrupt and destroy them. To any others, who think as Jefferson did, history has proven otherwise. We are currently proving otherwise.

"You think you're discussing technologies, and you quickly discover that you're discussing belief systems. The battle among environmentalists over how or whether our future energy is supplied is a cipher for something much bigger: who we are, who we want to be, how we want society to evolve. Beside these concerns, technical matters – parts per million, costs per megawatt hour, cancers per sievert – carry little weight. We choose our technology – or absence of technology – according to a set of deep beliefs: beliefs that in some cases remain unexamined. The case against abandoning nuclear power, for example, is a simple one: it will be replaced either by fossil fuels or by renewables that would otherwise have replaced fossil fuels. In either circumstance, greenhouse gases, other forms of destruction and human deaths and injuries all rise. The case against reducing electricity supplies is just as clear. For example, the Zero Carbon Britain report published by the Centre for Alternative Technology urges a 55% cut in overall energy demand by 2030 – a goal I strongly support. It also envisages a near-doubling of electricity production. The reason is that the most viable means of decarbonising both transport and heating is to replace the fuels they use with low-carbon electricity. Cut the electricity supply and we're stuck with oil and gas. If we close down nuclear plants, we must accept an even greater expansion of renewables than currently proposed. Given the tremendous public resistance to even a modest increase in windfarms and new power lines, that's going to be tough. What the nuclear question does is to concentrate the mind about the electricity question. Decarbonising the economy involves an increase in infrastructure. Infrastructure is ugly, destructive and controlled by remote governments and corporations. These questions are so divisive because the same world-view tells us that we must reduce emissions, defend our landscapes and resist both the state and big business. The four objectives are at odds. But even if we can accept an expansion of infrastructure, the technocentric, carbon-counting vision I've favoured runs into trouble. The problem is that it seeks to accommodate a system that cannot be accommodated: a system that demands perpetual economic growth. We could, as Zero Carbon Britain envisages, become carbon-free by 2030. Growth then ensures that we have to address the problem all over again by 2050, 2070 and thereon after. Accommodation makes sense only if the economy is reaching a steady state. But the clearer the vision becomes, the further away it seems. A steady state economy will be politically possible only if we can be persuaded to stop grabbing. This in turn will be feasible only if we feel more secure. But the global race to the bottom and its destruction of pensions, welfare, public services and stable employment make people less secure, encouraging us to grasp as much for ourselves as we can. If this vision looks implausible, consider the alternatives. In the latest edition of his excellent magazine The Land, Simon Fairlie responds furiously to my suggestion that we should take industry into account when choosing our energy sources. His article exposes a remarkable but seldom noticed problem: that most of those who advocate an off-grid, land-based economy have made no provision for manufactures. I'm not talking about the pointless rubbish in the FT's How To Spend It supplement. I'm talking about the energy required to make bricks, glass, metal tools and utensils, textiles (except the hand-loomed tweed Fairlie suggests we wear), ceramics and soap: commodities that almost everyone sees as the barest possible requirements. Are people like Fairlie really proposing that we do without them altogether? If not, what energy sources do they suggest we use? Charcoal would once again throw industry into direct competition with agriculture, spreading starvation and ensuring that manufactured products became the preserve of the very rich. (Remember, as EA Wrigley points out, that half the land surface of Britain could produce enough charcoal to make 1.25m tonnes of bar iron – a fraction of current demand – and nothing else.) An honest environmentalism needs to explain which products should continue to be manufactured and which should not, and what the energy sources for these manufactures should be. There's a still bigger problem here: even if we make provision for some manufacturing but, like Fairlie, envisage a massive downsizing and a return to a land-based economy, how do we take people with us? Where is the public appetite for this transition? A third group tries to avoid such conflicts by predicting that the problem will be solved by collapse: doom is our salvation. Economic collapse, these people argue, is imminent and expiatory. I believe this is wrong on both counts. Last week something astonishing happened: Fatih Birol, the chief economist of the International Energy Agency, revealed that peak oil has already happened. ""We think that the crude oil production has already peaked, in 2006."" If this is true, we should be extremely angry with the IEA. In 2005 its executive director mocked those who predicted peak oil as ""doomsayers"". Until 2008 (two years after the IEA now says it happened) the agency continued to dismiss the possibility that peak oil would occur. But this also raises an awkward question for us greens: why hasn't the global economy collapsed as we predicted? Yes, it wobbled, though largely for other reasons. Now global growth is back with a vengeance: it reached 4.6% last year, and the IMF predicts roughly the same for 2011 and 2012. The reason, as Birol went on to explain, is that natural gas liquids and tar sands are already filling the gap. Not only does the economy appear to be more resistant to resource shocks than we assumed, but the result of those shocks is an increase, not a decline, in environmental destruction. The problem we face is not that we have too little fossil fuel, but too much. As oil declines, economies will switch to tar sands, shale gas and coal; as accessible coal declines, they'll switch to ultra-deep reserves (using underground gasification to exploit them) and methane clathrates. The same probably applies to almost all minerals: we will find them, but exploiting them will mean trashing an ever greater proportion of the world's surface. We have enough non-renewable resources of all kinds to complete our wreckage of renewable resources: forests, soil, fish, freshwater, benign weather. Collapse will come one day, but not before we have pulled everything down with us. And even if there were an immediate economic cataclysm, it's not clear that the result would be a decline in our capacity for destruction. In east Africa, for example, I've seen how, when supplies of paraffin or kerosene are disrupted, people don't give up cooking; they cut down more trees. History shows us that wherever large-scale collapse has occurred, psychopaths take over. This is hardly conducive to the rational use of natural assets. All of us in the environment movement, in other words – whether we propose accommodation, radical downsizing or collapse – are lost. None of us yet has a convincing account of how humanity can get out of this mess. None of our chosen solutions break the atomising, planet-wrecking project. I hope that by laying out the problem I can encourage us to address it more logically, to abandon magical thinking and to recognise the contradictions we confront. But even that could be a tall order. A fully referenced of this article can be found on George Monbiot's website"

A mental patient hangs herself with her own clothes tied to the top of a toilet stall. HIV-infected blood is tossed out with the regular trash. Wright L. Lassiter III was thinking, Why should I take this job? There was more: Nurses who followed doctors’ orders only when they felt like it. Millions of dollars in losses year after year. A culture that favored blame over accountability. A sad parade of feckless executives — 10 CEOs in 11 years. It was 2005 and Lassiter was next in line. Lanky, charismatic, and a rising star in the health-care industry, Lassiter could have become just one more executive casualty when he took the job as CEO of the Alameda County Medical Center in Oakland, California, and its flagship, Highland Hospital. Instead, he did what seemed impossible: He turned a shockingly mismanaged urban safety-net hospital system in one of America’s most violent cities into a model for other public hospitals. He trimmed costs without any significant cutback in services — in fact, services have been greatly expanded. A new $668 million hospital building is under construction. Six years on, the center has turned a positive margin every year but the last, when a new auditor required it to set aside more money for pension costs; so far, it is on target to break even this year. No one is pretending that ACMC is immune from the severe financial problems facing public hospitals. Atlanta’s Grady Health System is facing a $30 million shortfall. Miami’s Jackson Health System is in even worse straits: It lost $93 million in fiscal 2010 and is on track to lose another $78 million this year; cash on hand is down to 19.6 days. Over the past 20 years, the number of public hospitals has declined by more than 25%, to 1,072. With federal budget cuts looming, states going broke, and local governments preparing for the worst of it to roll downhill and bury them, public institutions are going to have to learn to manage better. Forty-seven-year-old Lassiter and his team’s accomplishment in Oakland shows it is possible for even the most dysfunctional public hospitals to shake themselves awake, serving the public and respecting taxpayers’ dollars at the same time. Says Thomas Rundall, a health-policy and management professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley: “It’s a model for how a publicly owned hospital with a challenging payer mix can be profitable.” HIGHLAND SITS on a small hill above a low-income residential neighborhood in inner-city Oakland. Hidden by trees from the nearby freeways, it’s barely visible to suburban commuters heading toward the Bay Bridge to jobs in San Francisco. The site is an architectural hodgepodge: the cream-colored Spanish baroque towers of the oldest building, erected in 1927; a recently built clinical center wrapped in green glass; a huge gray block in the Brutalist style, slated for a teardown as the new hospital rises. Walk inside, past the ever-present county-sheriff squad cars, and you may see some gangbangers and gunslingers, crackheads and crazy people, and the other stock characters who lend drama to every inner-city public hospital. Mostly, though, you’ll just see sick poor people — mainly blacks, Latinos, Asians — the unemployed, and the working poor sitting under fluorescent lights, waiting for their turn to see a doctor or nurse. “Ten years ago, if you said in 2011 I’d be working in a public-hospital system, I would have said, ‘Not likely,’ ” Lassiter says. “A worthy cause, yes, but not my kind of thing.” At 6-foot-5, he is scrunched against a little round conference table in his office at Highland; papers are strewn across his desk, reports and journals piled on the floor. It looks more like an academic’s college office than the lair of a corporate CEO. In 2002, he was climbing the executive ranks at a large private-hospital system in Dallas. Then the CEO of JPS Health Network in Fort Worth, which serves the poor and uninsured in Tarrant County, recruited him as VP of operations and charged him with making a system that never turns anybody away as good as any private one. A challenge that big, Lassiter decided, could be his kind of thing. The son and grandson of ordained ministers, Lassiter had what he calls a “small-town Southern upbringing” in Tuskegee, Alabama. His father is an educator, his mother a nurse. Tuskegee in the 1970s remained starkly segregated, which Lassiter realized at age 12, when his family moved to Columbia, Maryland, outside of Washington, D.C. “My first day driving around, I saw blacks and whites holding hands as couples,” he recalls. “I asked my mom, very innocently, ‘Is that okay, what they’re doing?’ “ His own life revolved around the Baptist religion, school, and sports. He credits one basketball coach, “a white guy in his sixties who chewed tobacco and spewed expletives,” with teaching him the joys of hard labor. The coach drove the team out to help on his farm. “Today, a white coach taking a truck full of black kids to work on his farm would get fired,” he says. “But I got a lot of discipline from that.” He remembers the two months he lived with his father at a YMCA in Schenectady, New York, as the most formative period of his youth. His father had just taken a job as president of the local community college, and the family had yet to move into their new house. A star basketball player, he was greeted at his new high school as what the newspapers called “the Jumping Jack from Wilde Lake,” and, according to his father, a red carpet “lined with pretty girls on both sides” was rolled out. Living at the YMCA embarrassed the young Lassiter at first, but he now says it turned into “an unusual bonding experience” that kept him from getting a big head. “I’m a professor of business ethics,” says his father, Wright Jr., 77, chancellor of the Dallas County Community College District. “I’ve always emphasized he needs to be a good ‘servant leader,’ someone who’s not into work simply for the personal benefit, but for the greater good.” Although Lassiter takes his father’s advice seriously, he says that the “servant” idea can be misapplied in a public-hospital setting. “The attitude at a public hospital often is ‘We’re doing God’s work. We get to feel good about being a martyr. Don’t worry about execution. Don’t worry about service. We’re doing God’s work.’ “ As soon as he made his move from Fort Worth to Oakland, Lassiter made clear that God’s work wouldn’t get done unless the place stopped losing money and shaped up fast. ACMC WAS A POSTER child for public-hospital dysfunction. The doctor’s murder and the patient’s suicide pointed out serious operational lapses, but the core problem was financial: Year after year, according to the Alameda County Grand Jury, the place lost millions beyond what it took in from the government, charities, paying customers, and other sources. (California is one of a handful of states that make grand juries the watchdogs of county government.) The grand jury described management as “a shambles.” CEO after CEO failed to stanch the bleeding, even after Alameda County voters passed a half-cent sales-tax hike to stabilize the system’s finances. In 2004, the hospital board brought in Cambio Health Solutions to rescue the institution. Cambio’s plan to cut 300 jobs and slash patient services was a political nonstarter. A one-day strike was energized by a visit from Jesse Jackson. Highland already was overcrowded; nobody in the community wanted services reduced. After 18 months and a fee of $3.2 million, Cambio departed. When Lassiter signed on in 2005, the place was still losing $1 million a month. He quickly began building a new management team, including COO Bill Manns, who was hired from Providence Hospital in Southfield, Michigan, near Detroit. At Manns’s suggestion, they immediately commenced a grassroots money hunt, which Lassiter now calls “the foundation of our success.” The pair gathered the top 85 managers, formed them into a dozen teams, and gave them 16 weeks to find $21 million in cost cuts and new revenue. Lassiter says he told them: “It’s up to you. We barely know where the restrooms are, so we’re not going to solve this problem. You’re going to solve it.” To encourage fresh thinking, Lassiter and Manns devised “odd-couple arrangements,” putting together doctors, nurses, techs, and other managers. The teams drilled into vendor contracts and challenged their own habits. Take the kit used to test newborns’ umbilical-cord blood, a $96.50 item. A simpler tool does the same job for 29¢. Is the more-expensive device better? How much better does it have to be to be worth the extra $96.21? ACMC had been choosing the premium option, at a cost of $322,000 a year. Now, the teams decided, ACMC could not afford it. Looking for new revenue, they identified areas the system was especially good at — like rehabilitation and diabetes care — and came up with ways to treat more patients more efficiently. Lassiter also pushed the creation of an electronic network that links dozens of community clinics to the health center, significantly boosting referrals to its best services. Only after the teams had found every dollar in savings and new revenue did Lassiter and Manns consider layoffs. As a result, instead of the service reductions and hundreds of job cuts the consultant Cambio had recommended, ACMC sliced only about 80 positions, found other work for many employees whose jobs had been eliminated, and began expanding services. Together the cuts and the revenue increases amounted to $23 million. “That’s what really got the buy-in” from the unions on layoffs, Manns says. “We looked at everything else first. What can you say to that?” “WE KNOW you’re from Texas,” a union chief said to Lassiter at their first meeting. “Texas is not union friendly.” This was early 2005. Lassiter had been offered the job, but he hadn’t officially started. There was still time to back out. “Let me tell you my view, and I think we could really work well together,” Lassiter remembers responding. “At the end of the day, I’m more accountable to the employees than to the union. I’ve got to treat them well because there are a lot of places they can go work. If our focus is on the best care for patients — knowing employees have to be treated well to get there — we won’t have a lot of fundamental disagreement.” He recalls that “some of them looked at me like I’d just landed here in some spaceship. Like it was complete BS.” Lassiter had never had to deal with unions in Dallas or Fort Worth because workers there weren’t organized. Manns, with his Michigan experience, was steeped in union issues. In Oakland, the two men inherited a history of hostility between management and labor, represented by the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), and collective-bargaining agreements so restrictive that nurses could not be transferred from a department with a decreased workload to one that was understaffed. That meant hiring temps at significant cost. Jim Hubbell was an emergency-room nurse at Highland in the 1980s when AIDS was on the upswing. Like many who choose to work in an inner-city ER, he enjoyed what he calls “cowboy medicine.” But “the place was completely dysfunctional,” he says, largely because it seemed impossible to fire anyone. “I had to leave because of conditions — blood-caked gurneys, soaked mattresses from a variety of bodily liquids. The housekeeping guys usually had a card game going.” “It was hard to do something as simple as mount a TV monitor on the wall of a waiting room,” says UC Berkeley professor Rundall. “The question wasn’t when it would get done; it was whether it would get done.” When it finally became clear that the county might sell, decimate, or even close the system, he says, workers suddenly became more flexible. “It was a real fear of God.” As a result, management could make a case based on hard-core reality: We’ve raised wages to rough comparability with the private market. We’ve cut costs all we can and laid off as few as possible. We’re not seeking high margins to please shareholders; we’re seeking positive margins so we can remain in operation. The unions gave some ground. For example, employees were filling up the multistory parking garage connected to the hospital in the morning, leaving no spaces for clinic patients, who would circle the neighborhood hunting for spots, then arrive late. The patients fumed about parking; the doctors fell behind on appointments; the patients fumed more. After Manns made a case for putting patients first, the union agreed to use an off-site lot with free shuttles. Both management and union leaders are reluctant to talk much about the biggest human-resources problem ACMC faced: how to get rid of people who refused to work. A longtime physician at Highland, who prefers to remain anonymous, says the major impediment to improving management and quality on the hospital floor was nurses who wouldn’t do their jobs: “I’d say, ‘Nurse, draw this man’s blood,’ and she’d say, ‘Why don’t you do it yourself?’ And I would. This kind of thing happened every day before [Lassiter] got here.” Most nurses at ACMC are highly professional, this doctor says, and “even they wanted those nurses gone.” Manns says that he and Lassiter would not use the layoffs as a cover to get rid of bad performers; the layoffs were made for strategic reasons. The firings were a separate matter. Neither Lassiter nor Manns will be specific about the terminations, but a hospital spokesman says that “dozens” of nurses were fired, a change that “made all the difference in the world,” says the veteran doctor. Fran Jefferson, field director and 28-year veteran at SEIU, declines to say how many employees were let go. “There has certainly been a trend toward much harder and much more frequent disciplinary action, including termination — not just the nurses but hospitalwide,” she says. “In some cases, our members are not perfect and [the actions] are warranted. In other cases, we go to arbitration and have won several cases with back pay.” She adds, though, that with “public hospitals closing all over the place,” workers at ACMC in general are a lot better off now. “The revolving door of CEOs was terrifying,” she adds. “One after another, we had people with no vision who wouldn’t stay. Wright Lassiter has done an amazing job. He has a vision about where public hospitals need to go.” TERRIE SCOTT, a thin-framed 61-year-old woman wearing a baseball cap, sits in the waiting room at Highland’s endoscopy clinic. She’s there to support a friend who’s in for a colonoscopy. A lifelong Oakland resident, Scott has depended on Highland for health care for years. She’d come and wait and wait. “Oh, this place has really improved,” she says, raising her eyebrows and nodding with enthusiasm. “The wait is so much shorter. The time is cut in half now.” Dr. Taft Bhuket, the 40-year-old gastrointestinal specialist who is treating Terrie’s friend, was lured to Highland two-and-a-half years ago from a partnership in a private practice. “People thought I was crazy,” he says. The public-hospital mission appealed to him, as did the chance to help Lassiter improve and expand services at Highland. Shorter waits don’t only make for happier patients, Bhuket points out. They also boost hospital income. The more patients that safety-net institutions serve, the more money they receive from the government. When he came to Highland, the wait for a routine colonoscopy could be as long as a year. Some 1,750 procedures were performed each year. Now, the department does 3,000 annually, an increase of 70%, and has cut the backlog in half, to four to six months, while ousting expenditure by just 15% to 25%. Identifying the bottlenecks that made the improvement possible required Highland doctors, nurses, and technicians to do something they weren’t used to: collaborate with one another. “Everyone was working on his own Gilligan’s Island, doing his own thing,” says Bhuket. “But people wanted that catalyst that Lassiter provided. The docs and nurses have been here for decades. The administration is bringing all the pieces of the puzzle together to get that synergy.” WITH MOUNTING pressure on Medicare and Medicaid spending, and with the stubborn recession pushing more patients into safety-net medicine, Lassiter and crew cannot breathe easy. “Cutting costs is going to be an ongoing struggle,” says professor Rundall. “They’ll have to take millions, perhaps tens of millions, out of the cost structure. That’s going to be difficult to do.” The new federal health-care law is another wild card. If the individual mandate requiring everyone to have insurance survives court challenge, many ACMC patients will be free to switch to private doctors and hospitals. So Lassiter must position his institution not just as a place that satisfies captive customers but also as one that attracts and retains customers who have a choice. Ask Lassiter what his ultimate goal is, and he hesitates. He’s afraid he’ll come off as presumptuous, audacious. “I want to make this place as good or better than the private hospitals,” he finally blurts out. Two hospital groups, Kaiser Permanente and Sutter Health, now dominate the Oakland area. “I believe ACMC has to be a real third choice in this community, a place where an elected official or a corporate executive would come for care,” Lassiter continues. “It’s not just the quality of medical service; it’s the helpfulness. Are people looking you in the eye and saying, ‘What can we do for you?’ — anticipating your needs, instead of saying, ‘Just go in the corner and wait. We have too many people to deal with today.’ “ In other words, he wants to provide a level of service people don’t expect when they enter a public hospital, or most public institutions, for that matter. So far, he seems to be on his way. Note: This article was reported and written in partnership with Kaiser Health News, an editorially independent news service.

Kennedy Americans should not expect one battle, but a lengthy campaign, unlike any other we have ever seen. It may include dramatic strikes, visible on TV, and covert operations, secret even in success. We will starve terrorists of funding, turn them one against another, drive them from place to place, until there is no refuge or no rest. TOP STORIES Republican points to 'leaked' Biden call, accuses administration of 'manipulating' Taliban intel 'No SALT, no deal': Vulnerable Dems threaten revolt unless $3.5T bill cuts blue-states taxes CNN poll: America turns irate, glum - President George W. Bush. Momentous events that have changed American history have had at their core leadership that transcended party, administration and even time. President Kennedy’s vision for the moon landing, like President Bush’s vision for the hunt for Osama bin Laden, set in motion events that changed the world. It would take one giant leap for mankind to pretend President Nixon was the driving force behind the Apollo missions. He deserves credit, of course, for following Kennedy’s vision, just as President Obama deserves credit for following Mr. Bush’s vision, but it would be the step of a truly small man to ignore the real visionaries. Imagine if Nixon, in his first week in office, had signed an executive order to close NASA within a year as President Obama did with the Guantanamo detention center. Imagine if Nixon had claimed the Saturn V rocket, for example, was “not effective,” as Mr. Obama famously declared of the enhanced interrogation techniques used on terrorists. Imagine if Nixon had opposed Kennedy’s science initiatives with the same “fierce moral urgency of change” with which Mr. Obama opposed Mr. Bush’s “cowboy diplomacy” in the global war on terrorism. Would history still be so kind to Nixon - even when the moon landing occurred on his watch? It’s certainly no slight of Nixon, then, to give Kennedy the credit he was due, nor should it be for Mr. Obama now. Of course, in substantive ways, bin Laden finally was found not because of Mr. Obama but in spite of him. As President Reagan said, facts are stubborn things. According to CIA Director Leon Panetta, the much maligned enhanced interrogation techniques - including the infamous waterboarding - played an instrumental role in finding bin Laden. Mr. Obama declared that those techniques were “not effective” and ended their practice. Ponder for a moment the tortured ethics it takes to reconcile the pious declaration that we mustn’t pour water onto a terrorist’s face but we shall go into his home and shoot him in the face in front of his wife and children. That non sequitur aside, Mr. Obama warned us that the information gathered by waterboarding would be unreliable. The Obama administration declared its own war on the war on terrorism. It was so incensed at pouring water on terrorists’ faces - a technique that helped find bin Laden - that Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. continues to this day his unbelievable criminal investigation of the CIA operatives who dared to serve our nation’s security. Of course, if Mr. Obama had had his way, the Guantanamo detention center itself would be closed and the terrorists would be enjoying American constitutional rights in Terre Haute, Ind., and al Qaeda’s No. 2 man, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, would be given the world’s biggest megaphone in a show trial in New York City. Now President Obama has decided the world mustn’t see photographic evidence of bin Laden’s demise for fear that it might inflame the already inflamed Islamic extremists’ sensibilities, as though you can make water more wet. He wasn’t concerned about inflaming our enemies when he advocated the release of thousands of damning photos of prisoner abuse in Iraq and Afghanistan or when his team filled the airwaves with claims that a U.S. president had been torturing Arab detainees. The release of the bin Laden death photo is not simply to “spike the football,” as the president trivialized it. It can have substantial benefit. The gruesome death photos of Saddam Hussein’s evil sons, Uday and Qusay, assured a beleaguered nation that their reign of terror had ended. Was bin Laden any less evil? Do his enemies deserve any less assurance? The benefits reached far beyond just Iraq. The photo of Saddam Hussein himself being pulled from his spider hole near Tikrit immediately prompted the Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi to abandon his nuclear ambitions. Later, Saddam’s death photo gave a nation similar comfort and did not fuel a new eruption of the Arab world. America salutes Mr. Obama for following the brave leadership of Mr. Bush despite how difficult it must have been for him. Here’s a man who can barely bring himself even to discuss terrorism, the global war on terrorism or war itself, preferring instead to use such Orwellian euphemisms as “man-made disaster,” “overseas contingency operations” and “kinetic military action.” Still, as reluctant as he may have been, he was right to authorize the killing of Osama bin Laden. He was right to unleash the U.S. Navy SEAL Team 6 or, as Democrats deride them, “Cheney’s assassination squad.” Fools may rush in to claim all sorts of credit: Who can forget Vice President Joseph R. Biden declaring that the Iraq war surge would be “one of the great achievements” of the Obama administration? But again, facts are stubborn things. Mr. Bush deserves a nation’s gratitude. When his fiercest critics - chief among them our current president - assailed his approach to terrorism, he stood strong, thanklessly. When many in his own party abandoned him, he stood strong, thanklessly. When his own generals despaired, he stood strong, thanklessly. Today, thankfully, the world is a safer place because of him.

"by Brett Stevens on May 5, 2011 Just about any issue you encounter in the modern world can be separated according to the salesperson model. There is a surface layer, in which broad positive assertions are made, and after that an underlying experience layer, in which you figure out the more complex truth. When you go to a store and see the new dishwasher on sale, promises are made: it cleans more efficiently, it is whisper-quiet, you can fit more stuff into it. When you get it home and use it over the next year, you find out the limitations: it still uses a ton of water, whisper-quiet is relative to a jet plane, and some of the stuff you can fit into it doesn’t get cleaned. Sales pitches do not equate to reality although they purport to do so. In the same way, all political discourse splits into two threads. The first is how it will work out in the complex interaction between finance, politics and social factors; the second is how you spin it to the voters in a 30-second sound bite on the local news. The two are often completely divergent because the demands of political situations rarely fit into half-minute explanations at a fifth-grade reading level. The real problem with this situation is that once we tell these pleasant lies, and as grotesque oversimplifications they are that, they snowball as people “trust” them to be literal interpretations. As a result, we quickly reverse course from truth-seeking to myth-building. One such example is class warfare. Here’s the official story, which is official because it’s the most popular with the widest segment of our population: Conservative social scientists argue that income inequality is mainly the result of more workers in the average household and their age and education, and that the disappearance of the middle class is more statistical than real.[4] In a 2004 poll of 1,000 economists (from the AEA), a majority of polled economists favored “redistribution”. Note that in voting, the majority of respondents were of the Democratic ideology (Democratic:Republican ratio of 2.5 to 1.) [5] A study by the Southern Economic Journal found that “71 percent of American economists believe the distribution of income in the US should be more equal, and 81 percent feel that the redistribution of income is a legitimate role for government.”[6] One social scientist argues that without holding education, experience and industry constant, inferences to inequality are mere guesses.[7] – Wikipedia For an even more dramatic view, you can feed into the burn-the-witch-err-the-rich view: The upper 1 percent of Americans are now taking in nearly a quarter of the nationâ€™s income every year. In terms of wealth rather than income, the top 1 percent control 40 percent. Their lot in life has improved considerably. Twenty-five years ago, the corresponding figures were 12 percent and 33 percent. One response might be to celebrate the ingenuity and drive that brought good fortune to these people, and to contend that a rising tide lifts all boats. That response would be misguided. While the top 1 percent have seen their incomes rise 18 percent over the past decade, those in the middle have actually seen their incomes fall. For men with only high-school degrees, the decline has been precipitousâ€”12 percent in the last quarter-century alone. All the growth in recent decadesâ€”and moreâ€”has gone to those at the top. In terms of income equality, America lags behind any country in the old, ossified Europe that President George W. Bush used to deride. – Vanity Fair Why do so many economists, journalists and others think that wealth redistribution is a good idea? It’s the dominant media myth: that we’re experiencing class war from the top down. In fact, if we look at the layer beneath the sales job, we will see that the reverse is true. Throughout history, societies have collapsed because of class war, true — but class war from the bottom upward. What kind of war is this? Demographic warfare. Think about it this way: Throughout human history around half of humans died during childhood, and without reproducing:  In developed countries, almost all children (about 99 percent) now survive to adulthood, and even among the most impoverished, ignorant or undeveloped segments of these populations, the proportion of children who die during childhood is biologically almost insignificant. […] But childhood mortality was probably considerably lower than 50 percent among the wealthier, more intelligent, higher in status. Therefore, the modern population in developed countries (you and I) are almost entirely the offspring of the wealtheir, more intelligent, more conscientious, higher status classes of history. […] No matter how relatively underdeveloped and underprivileged a population – no matter how stupid, feckless and uncaring the mothers – for almost everywhere in the world at present, childhood death rates are all-but irrelevant to reproductive success: almost all children are ‘kept alive’ by ‘society’. Consequently, for the first and only time in human history, pure fertility drives demographic change – and also evolutionary change. – Bruce Charlton’s Miscellany With the advent of a modern-type society, childhood mortality falls and so those who pop out the most kids dominate demographically. That means a shift from the wealthy and powerful, to the poor and less powerful. In other words, you replace the founders of a society who could craft civilization out of raw wilderness. You replace them with the people who tagged along and ended up being unskilled labor. The official narrative is that the poor/unskilled are persecuted by the rich. The truth, if we look at broader history, is that the poor/unskilled overwhelmed the ability of that society to produce wealth. The root of class warfare is overpopulation from the bottom, and because they won’t blame themselves, they blame “the rich” which becomes a broad brush to target anyone with more than subsistence income. Naturally, this has dire implications for democracy. What is the point in having universal voter participation if each idea to be voted upon is in fact a sales job? The myth of the “informed voter” dissolves when we look at how little of the situation is actually conveyed, and how a stalemate would occur if we tried to tell the voters the truth. Politics becomes a stage-play after which the actors scurry home and get real work done. Even worse is the fact that we’re thinking in reverse. We blame people for being rich, since we assume that the rich are waging class warfare against the poor. As a result, we ignore the fact that people who got wealthier legitimately — professionals (doctors, lawyers, architects, MBAs) and small-business owners or managers — did so because of raw cognitive ability: Even assuming that, there are massive advantages inherent simply in being born rich (and disadvantages in being poor.) My favorite example, simply because it’s so dramatic, is that a child born into the lowest-earning quintile who manages to attain a college degree is less likely to be in the highest-earning quintile than a child born into the top quintile who does not attain a college degree. This is all the more remarkable when you consider that making it to, and through, college is far harder for poor kids than rich kids even at a given level of aptitude. (Two thirds of the kids with average math scores and low-income parents do not attend college, while almost two-thirds of high-income kids with average math scores do.) – TNR Even reducing all other factors, what we’re seeing here is that those who are more prosperous tend to be more intelligent. Not all of them, of course, but statistically, most of them. This is why books like The Bell Curve freak people out. Sure, there’s that troublesome chapter 13 about race — but even more, there’s the problematic idea that our native abilities determine what we should be doing in life. When you look at people who got rich for trivial acts, like entertainers or those who sold venal products like liquor to the masses, you’re not seeing the best of society rising. You’re seeing a champion of the unskilled dominating other unskilled through their own incompetence at choosing art over trashy entertainment, or quality liquor over gut-rot. We love to subsidize the unskilled, and pretend that by raising their income, we somehow make them as intelligent, morally balanced and insightful as the founders who persist in our professional classes: Today in America there are nearly twice as many people working for the government (22.5 million) than in all of manufacturing (11.5 million). This is an almost exact reversal of the situation in 1960, when there were 15 million workers in manufacturing and 8.7 million collecting a paycheck from the government. It gets worse. More Americans work for the government than work in construction, farming, fishing, forestry, manufacturing, mining and utilities combined. We have moved decisively from a nation of makers to a nation of takers. Nearly half of the $2.2 trillion cost of state and local governments is the $1 trillion-a-year tab for pay and benefits of state and local employees. Is it any wonder that so many states and cities cannot pay their bills? – WSJ Our budget in the United States is divided roughly in two. On one side are military and infrastructure costs; on the other, equivalent in dollar value, are entitlements and resulting government costs. Conservatives want to end war by ending subsidies. This stops the reckless proliferation of the unskilled and preserves the founder class. If you want your country to avoid falling into third-world status, this is your only option. Liberals want the unskilled to win the class war through wealth redistribution. The idea underlying this is that if uniformity is established, and equality imposed, there will be no cause for conflict. Sadly for liberals, it doesn’t work that way — when equality is established, even more vicious internal fighting results as some try to climb above the rest. In the process of trying to reach that equality, civilizations and lives are destroyed en masse: We live in an era of ethnic, national, and religious fratricide. A new two-volume reference work on “the most severe civil wars since World War II” has 41 entries, from Afghanistan and Algeria to Yemen and Zimbabwe. Over the last 50 years, the number of casualties of intrastate conflicts is roughly five times that of interstate wars. The number of refugees from these conflicts similarly dwarfs those from traditional state-versus-state wars. “Cases such as Afghanistan, Somalia, and Lebanon testify to the economic devastation that civil wars can produce,” note two political scientists. By the indexes of deaths, numbers of refugees, and extent of destruction, they conclude that “civil war has been a far greater scourge than interstate war” in recent decades. In Iraq todayâ€”putting aside blame and causeâ€”more Iraqis are killed by their countrymen than by the American military. – Chronicle for Higher Education What is the source of our failing as a human species? Class warfare. Specifically, the unskilled/poor crusading against the skilled/wealthier. Much of the history of the 20th century has resulted from political jockeying to evade this problem. It didn’t work; the problem persists. And what happens to nations where the unskilled predominate? Prole behaviour is invariably guided by poor impulse control, and subsequently, their lack of foresight. […] This compounds my theory about low IQ people having high testosterone, and therefore poor impulse control and everything else that entails, like breeding more. Obesity and addiction problems are also symptomatic of proles, which can be partially explained by other factors, but when it comes down to it: they are guided purely by caprice and appetite and those very issues engender prole problems. – Sofiastry Whether we call them proles, drones, unskilled or poor, the reality remains the same: people differ in intelligence and character, and those at the lower end of the scale wind up in less-essential positions with less wealth. While we may want to treat them well (most of us want to treat everyone well) we also have to look at the implications of their predominance in society. Sofia’s description above is as apt as any: lower-IQ and higher testosterone equals low impulse control, low systematic/planning, a certain amount of opportunism and socialized cost. Societies do not collapse because the rich decided to wage war on the poor. In fact, it’s ludicrous to think the rich would bother; they’re already rich. Societies collapse because the unskilled overwhelm their resources, force a crisis point, and then bring about collapse. This offends the public eye, composed equally of guilt-ridden middle-class people and the burnt-out unskilled, which thinks it is “elitist” to notice differences in ability and to deviate from our Soviet-style insistence that all are equal. However, that pathway leads only to the one kind of class warfare that does exist, which is the unskilled destroying the founders and thus, by killing off the intelligence their society needs, plunging it into darkness.

"During some events in your life, you will encounter pathological behavior. Like most tendencies in human experience, the concept comes before the action. Pathological behavior can be defined as any action of a method whose goal is not achieved by that method, no matter how many times it is repeated. Pathological behavior occurs when the concept behind an action is erroneous, and the individual deciding how to act does not recognize this fact. We see pathological behavior in many ways every day. The people who buy lottery tickets and never win, or the lonely souls who carry someone home from the bar to wake up lonely, or even the endless get rich schemes of the masses who chase wealth and, failing, enrich the scammers and frauds of our modern world. All of these pathological behaviors have two components: a flawed conception of the world that unites an unrealistic worldview with an expection of certain result in reality. The problem with pathological behavior in a social system is that a form of inductive capacitance can be measured in human beings. When two wires are run parallel, current sent through one can be measured in the other. By a similar principle, if two human beings exist in social parallel, they absorb the nervous energy - a sort of essential simplification of idea - in the form of half-understood concepts and desires. As if by osmosis, people grasp the essence of an idea and it becomes the ideative portion of their pathology. ""God will save us"" and ""The state will find a solution"" are scarcely removed as concepts in this pathos. It's not easy to recognize this. Our civilization has become complex and interdependent enough, and the normal person is so overwhelmed with needs and desires, that it is impossible to point to proof of its failure -- but more importantly, it's equally impossible to point to proof of its success. Many people note the increasing problems (crime, corruption, pollution) and correlate it to a lack of great achievements (art, music, philosophy) but two things hold them back: first, the system seems to be working, and it puts food on the table, so don't rock the boat. Second: we are still so awed by our technology that we put unlimited faith in it, as well as our technology of mind, which has us supposing that educators and psychologists will find a way to make us all productive citizens somehow. Yet there's nothing obvious we can point to (like a clock counting down the sky) and claim it is proof for all to see that our society is failing. All will never see, even if a giant rubber monster attacks North America, because they will revert to non-logical behaviors; this is the brain's way of avoiding kernel panic and shutting down in disbelief (interestingly, many who faint at disasters first become irrational). They turn to religion, or focus on irrelevancies, and this enables them as peaceful a demise as can be engineered. But the demise we face is not a fast one, but a slow decline into irrelevance, and it is both far off and close by in that we are now in the last few decades in which we can reverse it. Societies that collapse slowly do not explode. They stagger, through a series of failures and incompetent compensations, into a third-world state where a mass of lumpenproles -- dumb, grey/tan, and devoid of all higher culture or philosophy -- are ruled by a pompous elite who got the position through a single qualification: immense wealth. Eventually this decadent elite consumes itself through infighting and inbreeding, and what is left is a burned-out shell of a society staffed by dumber, fatter, sicker, more generic versions of its previous occupants. There is a point where this course cannot be reversed, because culture has been destroyed and the elites are too powerful and the masses too dumb to oppose them -- usually distracted by ""panem et circenses"" or technological equivalent (fast food, TV). At that point, there is so little consensus among the people that they can literally be bought off for a single issue: gay rights, legal marijuana, recycling, more churches. We are not yet at that point but it approaches rapidly, and if ""the people"" were able to unite behind a single impetus toward change it would be easily reversible. However, they seem more concerned with ""personal"" issues, meaning political change that benefits them and to hell with the rest, than they are with holistic fixes to an otherwise suicidal system. This condition arises because just as most people are specialized to a certain level of thinking, few are capable of using what F. Scott Fitzgerald reference to as ""cynical"" thinking but which might be better called by the name used in American colleges before it became taboo: ""critical thinking."" Critical thinking means the ability to compare a stated goal to the method used to reach it, and to separate the actions which will be successful from those that are pathological. Critical thinking allows one to predict enough of the levels of consequence of any one method to project its effects in the future, no matter how popular it is, and critical thinking is a rarity in society today. Sage observers refer to modern society as pathological because despite knowing that much of what we do is wrong, we persist in repeated patterns, if for no other reason because because we're overwhelmed. Still, it is not logical behavior, and should be seen as on par with children who refuse to eat their vegetables because they prefer ice cream. Not everything we do in life corresponds to our wishes. Much of it is a matter of ""work,"" or overcoming resistance to put things into a better organization so they function beneficially. If we are to trace the roots of this pathology we will find a simple root cause. After sorting through all of the details and problems and intermediate causes, we come to an original error: what philosophers call ""consequentialism,"" or the idea that what most people think they prefer is the best course of action. This can be seen in our democratic system of leadership, our belief in personal ownership of stock and businesses, and our social system that replaces culture with what is popular to the mass taste. All of these ideas, which we disguise with materialist and humanist rhetoric, originate in the idea that what we prefer as a group is the best course of action. Anyone who has chaired a committee, or tried to achieve consensus even in a small group like a family, knows that a direction can only be found when every individual considers it not in context of themselves but in the context of a task which includes them but is not limited to them. If left up to their own concerns alone, individuals pick what benefits them, and since the rest of the question -- overall direction for all individuals -- is a distant second, they consider it barely and conclude it will be addressed by what they summarize in partial witticisms and homilies. ""It's all good""; ""It'll work out""; ""The People will rise up and fix it."" However, the middle class in America and Europe is beginning to see that they, the professionals and leaders of the layer beneath politicians but above workers, have become an endangered species. An influx of cheap labor has made the rich richer, and products cheaper, but the socialized costs of a society without consensus as to direction (something achieved through agreement on values, which are passed down through generations in a form we call culture) make it harder to find respite from the madness. The middle class sees a future in which more money is required to have homes away from the ghetto, more time must be spend on the road commuting, and more effort must be spent in bypassing now-ruined public services for private offerings. And the workers? Most of these will acknowledge some degree of incompetence in managing their own affairs. Fodder for the workplace, they either walk the straight and narrow or try a way around and in all cases but a few get busted and re-introduced to society as even cheaper labor. The stockholders and CEOs laugh and dumb down the job requirements, making them as simple as pressing buttons on different machines, but the group of violent, stupid, alienated people grows and with it the costs to the middle class. Who gets penalized by crime and unrest? Not the elites behind private security walls. The middle class and the working people pay the price for society's decay. In a sensible system, it would be recognized that true leadership (and not just parroting back what the poll figures suggest will be popular) is as rare as the ability to design rockets, do higher math, write philosophy or compose symphonies. A leader is one who intervenes between what the people think they want and what they must do, and either explains to them the logical course or forces it upon them. Whether justification or oppression is used is irrelevant, because if what is logical becomes law, the people are better off even if they had to sacrifice some personal demands for the whole. When the whole becomes sick, we all pay. When we sacrifice for a better whole, we all benefit. None of our current political solutions are sufficient. It is too easy to promise a pleasant illusion and ignore real problems or opportunities, and so our leaders do it. They, after all, only want to crawl their way out of the morass of poverty that is ensnaring the middle class. Even non-mainstream political solutions fail. While the environment is part of what must be addressed, it is not all of it, and so Greens are left as partial solvers of a detail whose root is the cause described. While a failing of traditional values is part of the problem, it is not all of it, so Conservatives become marginalized with the religious fanatics in a mire of abortion, gay marriage and drug laws. While racial decline and loss of homogeneity are part of the question, they do not complete it, which leaves nationalists further isolated from a solution. The answer is relatively simple: there is one truth, and we call it reality. Many voices describe it and in any genre there are those who understand most of it, but to see it requires putting our personal interests and egos second to finding truth and enacting it. None of us are god; all of us have some position in the hierarchy of nature, and not all of us can lead and thus not all of our opinions are important in a leadership context. But when we stop concerning ourselves with consequentialism, and look instead toward finding a correct path, we are suddenly less likely to lead ourselves down a path which destroys the whole. As the whole is the provider for the fulfilment of individual wishes, at that point, we also lose our personal concerns. What we think we desire is contingent upon a healthy whole. When you ask a group of people their concerns, they will pipe up about details, but it is unlikely they will focus on that whole. For humanity to survive as something other than a degraded society where the rich rule the stupid, we need to instead find consensus by targetting reality in recognition of how nature, a healthy civilization, and culture as a reservoir of social learning are essential to our individual futures. Should we wish to survive, and all healthy people do, this is the time to set aside our personal fears, selfish desires and confusions and to enact, finally, a better system of human self-government -- before it is too late."

"by Brett Stevens on April 17, 2011 You probably figured out that most people aren’t equal early in your life. Some kids played nice, even contributed something not just materially but emotionally; others took your stuff, scorned you or worse, were oblivious to everything but their own needs. In fact, you’ll find that most of the kids who played nice became very discerning about their friends. Most people were OK, sure, but they tended to be selfish and oblivious, and so it was best to find more people who also played nice. Kids who played nice tended to be those who could think the process through and realize that being selfish or oblivious was ultimately a failing strategy. They weren’t “born nice,” but chose nice as a more efficient way of living, much as we choose civilization over anarchy. In my own experience, it was the smarter kids who played nice — because these smarter kids were focused on more than the petty and immediate. If the toy truck wasn’t available to play with because every other kid in the school wanted it, these kids found another toy and learned to like that. They could defer gratification and see creative solutions to problems. Our society is of a hybrid, fractured nature. In general, the kids who played nice because they were smarter tend toward the higher levels of their professions. If they’re plumbers, they’re the ones you can trust. If they’re lawyers, they’re the honest ones. If they’re doctors, they’re the creative thinkers who diagnose rare problems as easily as common ones. The smart kids who played nice form a natural elite, no matter what level of society they occupy. But because they are both competent and empathic, they tend to succeed unless they specifically cast wealth away. As a result, statistically and demographically, the wealthier tend to be smarter, more competent and more disciplined. We want more humans with those traits, don’t we? Our differing attitudes toward government can be viewed by the following split of cause/effect logic, which is a way of viewing the world by noticing that each thing that exists has a clear cause or causes that are separate from all others. It’s not there arbitrarily, which means these causes take repeated form, which enables us to formulate natural laws. For example, if you drop a ball it falls; the cause is gravity, the effect is the ball falling, and the natural law is whatever our theory of gravity is at the moment. In the political split this creates: If you pay attention to effects, you see these as the problems of our society: You are concerned about the states in which people live, not the decisions they made to arrive there. You would like society to fix this inequality of condition, and problematic or “cruel” methods, so that we live in a “fair” society where everyone has about the same wealth and status. If you pay attention to causes, you see these as the problems of our society: You are concerned with the decisions people make about how to live, and how they ignored the predictable conclusions of such decisions. You are more concerned with causes and goals than the methods used to achieve them, since you assume that life will be perpetually “cruel” in some form or another. Your definition of a “fair” society is a place where you can climb by paying attention to causes, and making sure your actions correspond to the causes that make good results according to the values of that society. If you’re from the first group, you might want to tax the rich as a means of evening out the supply of money: Increased taxes on the rich could help balance the budget and could ease the pressure to slash billions from social spending. Consider, for instance, the Fairness in Taxation Act introduced by Representative Jan Schakowsky, Democrat of Illinois, which would increase the top federal marginal income tax rate to 45 percent for married couples earning more than one million dollars a year and to 49 percent for billionaires, from the current rate of 35 percent. Historically unprecedented? Hardly. The top marginal tax rate was 50 percent in the mid-1980s and even higher in the 1950s (as the chart shows). Such a boost could raise an estimated $78 billion, more than the cuts that House Republicans were seeking in last weekâ€™s budget talks. – NYT The problem here? To an effects-based thinker, nothing. The wealth is being redistributed and society will be more fair. To a cause-based thinker? For starters, $78 billion won’t fix the problem. More importantly, you’re penalizing people for being more competent than others, which means you are subsidizing incompetence, and will get a society full of incompetents as a result. What’s a society full of incompetents look like, and why is it important to not hand these people big chunks of money? They waste it. They spend that money on end-user products, meaning that they kill its momentum and diffuse it into products which generate no further wealth. When you buy a tractor, more wealth will come of it; when you buy cars, groceries, consumer goods or luxury items, no such money is generated: In the year since the Gulf oil spill, officials along the coast have gone on a spending spree with BP money, dropping tens of millions of dollars on gadgets, vehicles and gear – much of which had little to do with the cleanup, an Associated Press investigation shows. The oil giant opened its checkbook while the crisis was still unfolding last spring and poured hundreds of millions of dollars into Gulf Coast communities with few strings attached. In sleepy Ocean Springs, Miss., reserve police officers got Tasers. The sewer department in nearby Gulfport bought a $300,000 vacuum truck that never sucked up a drop of oil. Biloxi, Miss., bought a dozen SUVS. A parish president in Louisiana got herself a top-of-the-line iPad, her spokesman a $3,100 laptop. And a county in Florida spent $560,000 on rock concerts to promote its oil-free beaches. In every case, communities said the new, more powerful equipment was needed to deal at least indirectly with the spill. In many cases, though, the connection between the spill and the expenditures was remote, and lots of money wound up in cities and towns little touched by the goo that washed up on shore, the AP found in records requested from more than 150 communities and dozens of interviews. – Seattle Times If you want to know why the Tea Party in the USA, and the New Right in Europe, are opposed to the “effects-based” society, this is it: you reward incompetence and strangle the economy, all while penalizing those who might be more competent than the masses. Liberalism generates a mob of a society that pulls down anyone who rises above the lowest common denominator, so that all of us can feel confident and accepted in our mediocrity. It wants to stop evolution, reject Darwinism, and ignore the possibilities of our future. Not surprisingly, such societies always fail; the tragedy is that in doing so they transform thriving countries, and leave behind ruins of a third world status in terms of kleptocracy, dysfunction, corruption, disorganization, bad hygiene and low competence. We could avoid that here in the United States, and the first step is rejecting “easy answers” like taxing the rich, stopping all wars, redistributing income and buying Macintosh computers.

"By Michael Barone - May 9, 2011 Some years ago, the columnist and editor Michael Kinsley sponsored a contest to come up with the most boring headline. The winner was, ""Worthwhile Canadian Initiative."" Well, Canada held an election last Monday, and the result was anything but boring. It amounts to something like a revolution in Canadian politics and has lessons, I think, for those of us south of the border. The headline story is that the Conservative Party of Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who has headed minority governments since 2006, won an absolute majority of seats, 167 of 308, in the House of Commons. It was a result practically no Canadian pundit or psephologist predicted. Going into this election, center-right parties in the four major Anglosphere democracies were at the brink of but not quite fully in power. The British Conservatives formed a government with the leftish Liberal Democrats in May 2010, the Australian Liberals are in opposition by virtue of the votes of a couple of Outback independents, and American Republicans won the House of Representatives in November 2010 and are now forcing significant cuts in public spending. In Canada, Harper's Conservatives have already cut taxes and modified spending programs, but always with the tacit consent of the separatist Bloc Quebecois, or the left-wing New Democrats, or the long-dominant Liberal Party. Now they're on their own, and we'll see the results. But the installation of a majority government by itself is not a political revolution. The biggest changes in Canada were indicated by the devastating defeats of two of the opposition parties. The Bloc Quebecois was reduced from 50 seats to only four. Formerly it represented most of Canada's second largest province. Now it represents a tiny rump. French Canadian separatism has been a major force in Canada since Charles de Gaulle came to Montreal in 1967 and spoke the deliberately provocative words, ""Vive le Quebec libre!"" There have been two referenda in which the voters of Quebec rejected separatism by only narrow majorities. Now it looks like separatism is as dead as de Gaulle. The vast majority of Quebec's ridings (the Canadian word for districts) elected New Democrats, some of whom didn't campaign and don't speak much French. Quebec's Francophone voters seem to have decided to vote for a party that favors a European-style welfare state rather than one that favors a separate Quebec. The New Democrats won 58 seats in Quebec, enough to give them 102 seats in Parliament, enough to make them the official opposition party.

"Sign In Debate to restart on Mexico border Manage Newsletters Shameless politicians use 9/11 to lecture America about “unity” Biden’s forced COVID-19 vaccine attack on minorities Dems’ totalitarian overreach threatens Americans’ livelihood President Obama is pledging border security and pleading for help from Republicans as he steps up his campaign to pass an immigration reform bill, but new polling suggests the rift within his own party is actually deeper than within the GOP on the issue. The data from the Pew Center for the People and the Press’ massive look at political parties, released last week, found that the gap between the ends of the Democratic coalition on favoring stricter enforcement and on legalization is twice as large as the gap between hard-line Republicans and their more libertarian-leaning cohorts. Mr. Obama will visit the border on Tuesday and deliver an immigration speech in El Paso, Texas, as the latest step in his push for action. But he is increasingly running up against some on his left flank who say he can take steps right now, without Congress, to halt deportations - a move immigrant-rights advocates say Hispanic voters will need to see before the next election. TOP STORIES Republican points to 'leaked' Biden call, accuses administration of 'manipulating' Taliban intel 'No SALT, no deal': Vulnerable Dems threaten revolt unless $3.5T bill cuts blue-states taxes CNN poll: America turns irate, glum “The debate over whether the president has powers under existing law to provide relief from deportation for certain immigrants is over. He does,” said Rep. Luis V. Gutierrez, Illinois Democrat and a key voice for immigrant rights in Congress. “The question is how broadly and how generously he will use those powers. That is what I will be listening for.” Hispanic groups say the president promised them during the 2008 campaign that he would work for an immigration bill during his first year in office, but that failed to happen as he focused instead on the economic stimulus and health care. Now, though, the president is trying to make up for lost time. In recent weeks, he has held meetings at the White House with nationally prominent politicians such as New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger; Hispanic entertainers, including Eva Longoria; and members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. Those meetings have drawn the ire of Republicans, who said they are one-sided and not likely to produce the bipartisan cooperation that the president says will be needed to pass a bill. The Pew survey data on political parties indicates that a broad majority of Americans, from both parties, want stiffer immigration enforcement, but also want illegal immigrants to be granted a path to citizenship as long as they pay fines and show they are holding a job. Still, while 94 percent of self-identified liberals wanted a path to citizenship, just 61 percent of so-called “hard-pressed” Democrats did. That is about twice the gap between conservatives and libertarians in the GOP’s coalition. On enforcement, the gap was just as stark: Just 55 percent of liberals wanted to continue the crackdown, while 88 percent of hard-pressed Democrats did, compared with a 7 point gap between main street Republicans and conservatives on the GOP’s side. Steven A. Camarota, research director at the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors stricter limits on immigration, said the proof that Democrats are divided can be found in the fact that despite holding huge numerical advantages, they didn’t try to bring a legalization bill to the floor in the last Congress until the lame-duck session, when it was easy for Republicans to block it. Mr. Camarota said the difference between the two parties is largely a matter of perception, fueled by the stances of party leaders. “It’s hard to think of anybody prominent in the Democratic Party who doesn’t favor the amnesty approach, where in the Republican Party you get leaders all over the place. George W. Bush was where Obama is, for example,” he said. “What this means is, it gives the superficial appearance that one party is more united than the other, and when it actually comes time to vote in Congress it doesn’t play out that way.” Mr. Obama says there used to be a bigger consensus on the issue when he was in the Senate, including in 2006 when the Republican-led chamber with President Bush’s backing, passed a legalization bill. But since then, the GOP’s backing in Congress has fallen off. Facing that, the president hopes to rally outside groups to build pressure on both parties, but the GOP in particular. “There was political opposition to comprehensive immigration reform, including from some places where there used to be political support. We are endeavoring to change that dynamic by rallying public support, by raising public awareness about the need for comprehensive immigration reform,” White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters Monday in previewing the trip to El Paso. Mr. Obama has previously ruled out taking unilateral action to halt deportations of broad classes of illegal immigrants, such as students or young adults who would be eligible for legal status under the Dream Act, which has yet to pass Congress. But he told the Hispanic lawmakers last week that he would reconsider their request. Alfonso Aguilar, executive director of the Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles, who worked on immigration issues in the Bush administration, said the president is losing support among Hispanics because he hasn’t made good on his promises. Mr. Aguilar said that Mr. Obama polled at nearly 75 percent among Hispanics after his election, but that has now dropped to below 50 percent. “It’s going to require more from the president to get Latinos to actually believe in him with regard to immigration,” Mr. Aguilar said. He said he expects Mr. Obama to continue making a push for legislation while blaming the GOP for not negotiating. “This is pure politics in the most crass way of doing it,” Mr. Aguilar said. Mr. Obama voted for immigration bills when he was in the Senate in 2006 and 2007, but has yet to offer a specific legislative plan as president for what he wants to see Congress pass. The key questions are fourfold: What further action needs to be taken on border security; how should interior enforcement be stepped up; what requirements will illegal immigrants have to meet in order to get on a path to citizenship; and will there be a guest-worker program for future workers, and will they also have access to citizenship.

"© 1998-2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All Rights Reserved A majority of Republicans said for the first time that a third party was needed in American politics, according to a Gallup poll released Monday. Fifty-two percent of Republicans, and an even stronger number of Tea Party supporters, support the creation of a major, third political party, underscoring the occasional tensions between grassroots conservatives and the GOP establishment. An overall majority of Americans, 52 percent, said that a third political party was needed; the most profound shift has come among Republicans.The number of Republicans who said that a third political party was necessary was at an all-time high since Gallup first began tracking opinion on the issue in 2003. And while support for a third party has crept steadily upward in the GOP, for the first time, it represents a majority opinion. Supporters of the Tea Party are even more likely to back a third party, the poll found. Sixty percent of Tea Party supporters back a third party, while 32 percent say the existing two parties are adequate. By contrast, 47 percent of Tea Party opponents said the bipartisan system is adequate, and 44 percent favored a third party. The poll isn't the first time that the specter of a Tea Party-affiliated third party has emerged. Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin (R) has asked ""Why not?"" of a third party if voters find themselves dissatisfied with Republicans. And Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), who had considered running for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012, said he sees a third party if Republicans stray from their principles. The prospect of a third party has already wreaked havoc in some races. In the special election for the congressional seat in New York's 26th congressional district, the Democratic candidate, Kathy Hochul, enjoys an advantage over the Republican, Jane Corwin, who is splitting votes with Tea Party candidate Jack Davis. House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) is in the 26th district on Monday to support Corwin. The Gallup poll, conducted April 20-23, has a 4 percent margin of error. View the discussion thread.

"By Daily Mail Reporter Updated: 06:06 EDT, 9 May 2011 20 View comments Perhaps it will tempt youngsters to take up stimulating board games. Or maybe the latest version of the ‘Scrabble Bible’ will simply prompt more blazing rows between seasoned players. Street slang terms including thang, grrl and innit are among almost 3,000 additions to the Collins Official Scrabble Words reference guide, which sees its latest edition released today. Traditionalists may be perplexed by the latest additions to the Scrabble Bible Drug nicknames such as gak, tik and tina, as well as Indian cookery terms keema, gobi and alu – or aloo – are now permissible in the game, as are internet phrases wiki and myspace. Robert Groves, editor of Collins English Dictionaries and the word list, last updated in 2007, said: ‘These additions are an eclectic mix of new technological jargon, overseas English, recent colloquialisms, street slang, and a few fairly well-established phrases that had not made it on to the list until now. ‘Over half of British homes own a Scrabble board, more than four million games are sold worldwide each year, and nearly anyone who has played it has been involved in a dispute over which words can and can’t be used. ‘Now all those arguments can be settled, with the latest official wordlist from Collins – the authority on Scrabble.’ The Glasgow-based team compiling the list did so with the help of Collins Corpus, the world’s largest language database of written and spoken English. Mr Groves added: ‘It is the essential reference for all Scrabble players, from tournament enthusiasts to families battling it out in their front rooms.’ Although traditionalists may cringe at some of the additions, Mark Nyman, a four-time world Scrabble champion, agreed that Collins’ decision was final. ‘When words become commonly used it’s representative and makes sense to include these in this reference book,’ he said. ‘It’s like the Bible for Scrabble players. It’s what we use to avoid any major arguments. It’s fundamental.’ Published by Associated Newspapers Ltd Part of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"
"This report was written by Nolan Hicks of the Austin bureau, with additional reporting by Rick Dunham in Washington. In the week since the federal government denied Gov. Rick Perry‘s request to have most of Texas granted major disaster status, leading Republicans have knocked FEMA’s decision, leaving the impression Washington is not assisting the fight against the massive wildfires plaguing rural counties. It is an impression disputed by officials at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, who awarded Texas its 26th grant Sunday to help cover the cost of fire fighting efforts. “This administration, through FEMA, has been working closely with the state throughout the duration of these fires, and we are supporting the fire fighting efforts,” FEMA spokeswoman Rachel Racusen said. Those 26 grants will reimburse 75 percent of the costs related to fighting designated fires throughout the state. It is the same reimbursement rate the state would have received if Gov. Perry’s request for major disaster status had been accepted. Gov. Rick Perry (AP photo) But Texas Republicans scoff at the administration’s assertions. “Approving grants to fight 27 out of more than 7,600 fires isn’t responsive, let alone ‘extremely responsive,’” said Kevin McLaughlin, a spokesman for Texas Sen. John Cornyn, R-San Antonio. “These claims would be laughable if they weren’t so insulting.” GOP lawmakers tweaked Obama for declining Perry’s invitation to visit fire-stricken Texas communities. “Since the fires stretch from one side of the state to the other, I hope he got a first-hand look at this devastating disaster,” Hutchison said. “The president should work with the governor to ensure quick approval of a disaster declaration application and provide the aid affected counties need and deserve.” Perry says he is “dismayed that this administration has denied Texans the much needed assistance they deserve.” Granting a major disaster declaration allows the federal government to help pay for the costs of reconstruction and direct aid to victims of the fires. Perry only requested ‘Category B’ funding, which provides reimbursement for the same activities as the fire management grants the state currently is receiving. In his letter to the President, Perry’s office said that the wildfires were so bad that major disasters should be declared in 252 of Texas’ 254 counties; including Harris, Bexar, Dallas, Tarrant and Travis counties. Perry also wrote that the “severity and magnitude” of the fires was so great that FEMA should direct other federal agencies to step in and help run the fire-fighting effort in those counties. Perry spokeswoman Lucy Nashed said the aid promised by FEMA was insufficient because it only covered the 26 major fires, not the 9,000 fires the state’s application cited in applying for the aid. She said that Texas had used a nationally accepted definition to determine that the state should receive a disaster declaration that would cover the 9,000 fires. Nashed described the definition as “an unplanned, unwanted, wildland fire; and, basically, a wildland fire is any fire on land.” That definition includes no standard for the size or intensity of the fire, but the standards for receiving federal grants do. To qualify for federal fire assistance, a state must be demonstrate that it has a need, such as a threat to lives, homes, government facilities and economic impact. The fires covered by the grants for federal reimbursement constitute the list of major fires the state has been combating for the past couple of months, said Kelly King, a spokesman for the Texas Forest Service."
"From the desk of Thomas F. Bertonneau on Mon, 2010-03-29 17:35 With the likes of Oswald Spengler, whose Decline he translated for an Italian readership, and Jose Ortega y Gasset, Julius Evola (1898 – 1974) stands as one of the notably incisive mid-Twentieth Century critics of modernity. Like Spengler and Ortega, Evola understood himself to owe a formative debt to Friedrich Nietzsche, but more forcefully than Spengler or Ortega, Evola saw the limitations – the contradictions and inconsistencies – in Nietzsche’s thinking. Evola differed from Spengler and Ortega in another way: like certain other Men of the Right during the same decades, he involved himself deeply in matters mystical and occult, creating a reputation during the last part of his life as an expert in such topics as Eastern religiosity, alchemy, and the vast range of esoteric doctrines. Hermann Keyserling comes to mind also, as having directed his interest to these matters. Nevertheless, Keyserling, who knew Evola’s work, avoided Evola, rather as Spengler had shied from Keyserling. It would have been in part because Evola’s occult investment struck Keyserling as more blatant and far-reaching than his own and in part because Evola appeared, in the early 1930s, to be sympathetic to Fascism and National Socialism, whereas Keyserling, like Spengler, saw these unequivocally as signs of the spreading decadence of his time and so criticized them from their beginnings. While Evola’s transient proclivities justified Keyserling’s misgivings, swift mounting mutual distaste put actual distance between Evola and the dictatorships. Had he known, Keyserling might have warmed to Evola. By the time war broke out, the self-styled Baron had explicitly repudiated dictatorial principles. Evola, who had his own theory of race, expressed particular revulsion towards Nazi race-policy and Mussolini’s aping of it in Italy after 1938. Evola nevertheless makes difficulties for those of conservative temperament who would appreciate his critique of modernity. He could be dismissive of Christianity, at least in its modern form, as a social religion; and like his counterparts on the Left, he despised the bourgeoisie and its values, so much so that at least one of his biographers has compared him, by no means implausibly, to Frankfurt-School types like Herbert Marcuse and Theodor W. Adorno. Yet Evola’s all-around prickliness belongs to his allure. Thus in a 1929 article, “Bolchevismo ed Americanismo,” Evola condemns with equal fervor Muscovite communism and American money-democracy, as representing, the both of them, the mechanization and dehumanization of life. Unlike the Marxists – and unlike the Fascists and National Socialists – Evola saw the only hope for Western Civilization as lying in a revival of what he liked to capitalize, on the one hand, as Tradition and, on the other, as Transcendence; he thus rejected all materialism and instrumentalism as crude reductions of reality for coarse minds and, so too, as symptoms of a prevailing and altogether repugnant decadence. I. Evola scholar H. T. Hansen sets out the details of his subject’s political involvements, making a generous exculpatory case, in the article that serves as introduction to the English translation of Men among the Ruins: Post-War Reflections of a Radical Traditionalist (1951). I direct readers to that article and to Evola’s own Autodifesa, which the same volume offers as an appendix to the main text, should they be interested in the particulars. Evola’s analysis of modernity interests me in what follows more than his vanishing political affinities in the Italy of his early maturity. Evola’s passionate distaste for the vulgarity of such things as democracy (that fetish of the modern world), “the social question,” and economics – which, as E. Christian Kopff points out in a recent article at the online journal Alternative Right, he regarded as “demonic” – belongs to his absolute conviction that the West has been locked in a downward-spiraling crisis of nihilism since the Eighteenth Century at the latest. The break-up of the Holy Roman Empire in the wars of religious factionalism presaged the break-up of coherent wisdom in the self-nominating Enlightenment’s war against faith. The era of the nation-state, as Evola sees it, disestablished the principle that political authority derives from a transcendent source. Evola admired what he calls the Ghibellinism of the Empire although he defends it against its modern detractors without nostalgia. One can never go back; one must deal with conditions, as they exist. Evola seems to have conceived Men among the Ruins, its title already commenting on existing conditions, and Ride the Tiger: A Survival Manual for Aristocrats of the Soul (1961) as a dual introduction to his masterwork, Revolt against the Modern World (1934). In Men among the Ruins, Evola assesses the contemporary crisis, the “disease” and “the disorder of our age,” paradoxically: Totalitarianism, a grim trend fully abetted by eager widespread conformism, is, in effect, a type of chaos such that the maximum of illegitimate coercion exists in a society simultaneously with the maximum of riotous lawlessness; meanwhile the proliferation of dazzling technical gadgetry, in fascination with which the masses believe themselves to be participating in progress, coexists with a descent from the social and ethical refinements of medieval civilization into various resurgences of degrading primitivism. One might think of the way in which the Internet is bound up with pornography and gambling. In Evola’s scheme, the Reformation, the rise of science, and the Industrial Revolution mark stages of descent, not of ascent, in the history of viable socio-political forms. For Evola, the modern exaltation of the instrumental, the practical, and the material is tantamount not only to a petulant rejection of every “higher dimension of life” but also to a perverse embrace of “spiritual formlessness.” Thus the degradation of the person, a term that Evola uses in a special way, belongs to a regime that achieves control, entirely for the sake of control, by encouraging the lowest appetitive urges of that desperate but useful creature, the mere numerical individual. Evola here avails himself frankly of Ortega’s category of the mass man, whose sole quality consists in his unavoidable overwhelming quantity. Evola identifies the proximate source of these trends in “the subversion introduced in Europe by the revolutions of 1789 and 1848” although analysis could trace both outbursts to prior stages and events. In equality, the central fetish of revolutionary subversion, Evola sees a phenomenon neither natural nor properly cultural that suggests the deeply seated aversion of a reputedly liberated consciousness to the actual, graduated structure of reality. In particular, as Evola remarks, contemporary humanity has cut itself off entirely from the only context that could clarify a man’s worth for him and integrate him into a meaningful life: that concinnity of “sovereignty, authority, and legitimacy” by which “every true State” achieves “transcendence of its own principle.” More Platonist than Christian – perhaps in certain moods, as I have suggested, anti-Christian – Evola insists that the meaning of a polity consists solely in its embodying “a higher order,” through which alone its “power” derives. A traditional polity, being essentially hierarchical, will thus never adopt the face of democracy; indeed, its aristocrats will rule by “absoluteness,” in the sense that their stewardship of order, their “Imperium,” will always take direction from their spiritual participation in the same “aeterna auctoritas” that bestows intelligibility on the physical cosmos. The social classes of the traditional polity recognize the authority embodied in their governors by its outward signs of dignity and justice proper to regal persons. Democracy represents the opposite principle to these (insofar, that is, as it can be said to represent any principle): democracy is dissolute; it liquefies all achieved structure and all justified value-subordination in its amoeba-like abolition of true differences. One might note that a faint echo of what Evola would recognize as genuine order informs even so late a stage of modernity as the American founding, with its references to a “Creator.” Nevertheless, Evola’s assertion that the polity and its governors must make manifest a transcendent order – cosmic, divine, and paternal – lies so far from the prevailing definition of existence that even most of those calling themselves conservative must gape at it in dumb non-understanding. Modern practice has crassly inverted the traditional vision of order, orienting itself downwards to the chthonic, the animistic, and the maternal. Democracy, for Evola, belongs with this infantilizing abasement of life, as does the obsessive and vacuous notion, as he sees it, of individuality. Here too the prevailing mentality must recoil – how could anyone not advocate for the individual? Is not the sanctity of the individual the indispensable basis of Anglo-Saxon society? Is not the Bill of Right a set of guarantees for the individual? But Evola rigorously distinguishes the individual from the person, valorizing the latter. “The person,” Evola writes, “is an individual who is differentiated through his qualities, endowed with his own face, his proper nature, and a series of attributes that make him who he is and distinguish him from all others.” By distinction, “the individual may be conceived only as an atomic unit… a mere fiction of an abstraction.” Persons, being actually individuated, hold rank as “peers” in the differentiated company; in “the will to equality,” by contrast, Evola sees only “the will to what is formless.” Evola also insists on distinguishing “the organic State” from “the totalitarian State,” linking the former to individuation within a functioning hierarchy (to persons) and the latter to the featurelessness of democracy: “A state is organic when it has a center, and this center is an idea that shapes the various domains of life in an efficacious way; it is organic when it ignores the division and the autonomization of the particular and when, by virtue of the system of hierarchical participation, every part within its relative autonomy performs its own function and enjoys an intimate connection with the whole.” Evola writes that, “In totalitarianism we usually find a tendency toward uniformity and intolerance for any autonomy and any degree of freedom, [and] for any intermediate body between the center and periphery, between the peak and the bottom of the social pyramid.” In a society where Tradition governs, the “axiom… is that the supreme values… are not liable to change and becoming.” In a liberal society where democracy governs (which will be indistinguishable from a dictatorship), “there are no principles, systems, and norms with values independent from the period in which they have assumed a historical form, on the basis of contingent… and irrational factors.” Evola refuses to retreat from the two phases of a stark judgment: First that “the beginning of the disintegration of the traditional sociopolitical structures, or at least what was left of them in Europe, occurred through liberalism,” which is the direct precursor of revolution; and second that “the essence of liberalism is individualism.” Because the notion of equality amounts to “sheer nonsense” and constitutes a “logical absurdity,” any implementation of equality will necessarily entail a destruction of that which, by existing really and actually, offends democratic sentiment. Thus for Evola democracy itself is nihilism. II. Where Men among the Ruins takes on the task of describing our post-catastrophic predicament, Ride the Tiger prescribes how a genuinely individuated person might comport himself in a culturally devastated and morally degenerate environment. Ride the Tiger nevertheless also analyzes the topics that fascinate Evola, generally the grand spectacle of civilization in deliquescence and particularly the outward forms of the dominant corruption. The reader finds then, in Ride the Tiger, chapters devoted to “The Disguises of European Nihilism,” “[The] Collapse of Existentialism,” “Covering Up Nature – Phenomenology,” “The Dissolution of Modern Art,” and “Second Religiosity,” among many others. In respect of the mid-Twentieth Century situation Evola urges his readers not to mistake the ongoing visible disintegration of the bourgeois world for the primary cataclysm in whose shattered landscape they live: “Socially, politically, and culturally, what is crashing down [today] is the system that took shape after the revolution of the Third Estate and the first industrial revolution, even though there were often mixed up in it some remnants of a more ancient order, drained of their original vitality.” Evola remains steadfastly loyal to that “more ancient order,” in the resurrection of whose vitality the wellbeing of persons in a hostile world is implicated. Nihilism, in Evola’s discussion of it, knows how to conceal and dissimulate itself, how to smile, soothe, and cajole. The ability to ferret out nihilism’s hiding places and to penetrate its masks thus plays a key role in the continued autonomy of the individuated person or “aristocrat of the spirit.” Evola takes Nietzsche’s trope of “The Death of God” as usefully designating a particular “fracture… of an ontological character” that afflicts the contemporary scene. Through this “fracture,” Evola writes, “human life loses any real reference to transcendence,” and in its train the innumerable “doubles and surrogates” of “the God who is Dead” rise into prominence. Thus “when the level of the sacred is lost,” only empty formulas – ideologies – persist, like the “categorical imperative” posited by Kant or the “ethical rationalism” (as Evola names it) promulgated by Mill and his followers. Lurking beyond the scrim of these and other constructions, Evola sees “nihilism already visible.” For example, nihilism bodies forth in “the Romantic hero: the man who feels himself alone in the face of divine indifference” and who “claims for himself exceptional rights to what is forbidden.” After Romanticism, the spirit of negation appears under the label of “the absurd,” with its axiom of universal non-meaning and its dramatis personae of “lost youth,” “teddy boys,” and “rebels without a cause.” Hollywood and commercial culture continuously reinvent these limited types. With a reference to Kopff’s recent article, I mentioned earlier how Evola characterizes modern economic theory as “demonic.” Evola applies this label irrespective of whether the theory under scrutiny advocates a view rooted in Karl Marx or in Adam Smith because both represent masquerading nihilism. A rational concept of wealth becomes a “demonic” theory when the idea of money and its relation to goods, first, reduces itself to something entirely abstract and, next, inflates itself until it is the central and dominating Mumbo-Jumbo of a polity. It matters not whether the prevailing ideology is socialism or capitalism: “The error and illusion are the same,” namely that “material want” is the cause of all “existential misery” and that abundance generates happiness and lawfulness. In a stunning sentence, whose import almost no currently serving politician could grasp, Evola offers that, “the truth of the matter is that the meaning of existence can be as lacking in one group [rich or poor] as in the other, and that there is no correlation between material and spiritual misery.” Evola remarks that all of modern politics tends towards “socioeconomic messianism.” According to Evola, virtually all of modern and Twentieth Century philosophy is evasion or deception. Ride the Tiger’s chapters on Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, and Jean-Paul Sartre – not to mention Nietzsche – exposit the view that these thinkers, too, partake in the process of reducing reality to nothingness. Nietzsche, in Evola’s commentary, participates in the reduction of Transcendence to immanence: “Once the idols have fallen, good and evil have been surpassed, along with all the surrogates of God, and this mist has lifted from one’s eyes, nothing is left to Nietzsche but ‘this world,’ life, the body.” The Übermensch is Nietzsche’s ersatz-Transcendence. Evola ranks the Übermensch, a deferred futurity that supposedly justifies action now on its non-present behalf, as “not very different from Marxist-communist ideology,” with its sinewy image of Socialist Humanity. Nietzsche’s Will and Power are mere guises of “formlessness.” Husserl strikes Evola also as misguided, engaging in the old project of Saving the Appearances by de-realizing the appearances even further and so cutting off consciousness from its contact both with nature and Transcendence. As for Heidegger, as Evola sees things, the Dasein-philosopher has failed to go beyond Nietzsche and like his precursor has reduced life to desperate immanence. Heidegger’s doctrine “is a projection of modern man in crisis, rather than of modern man beyond crisis.” Nihilism can counterfeit itself in the guise of spirituality and religion. Thus what Evola calls “modern naturalism” and “the animal ideal” is linked to what he calls, while borrowing the term from Spengler, “second religiosity.” The labels “modern naturalism” and “the animal ideal” refer to the “back to nature” idea that the history of concepts traces to an original codification in Jean-Jacques Rousseau. “The natural state for man has never existed,” writes Evola, because “at the beginning [man] was placed in a supranatural state from which he has now fallen.” A de-individuating descent to the bosom of Mother Earth remains impossible by definition for culturally mature persons. Thus “every return to nature is a regressive phenomenon, including any protest in the name of instinctual rights, the unconscious, the flesh, life uninhibited by the intellect, and so forth.” The neo-Chthonic movements familiar on the modern scene belong to “second religiosity.” Like the “second religiosity” of the ancient world, that of the modern world is effeminate, matriarchal, and anti-intellectual; it is also thoroughly anti-spiritual. “Second religiosity” permeates modern life in “sporadic forms of spirituality and mysticism, even in irruptions from the supersensible.” However, such “symptoms” definitely “do not indicate re-ascent” to anything genuinely metaphysical. Evola died before environmentalism found its pseudo-Gospel in the scientifically now-discredited “Global Warming” hysteria, before organized feminism began its systematic emasculation of Western institutions, and before these trends had coalesced in Mountebanks and Priests-of-Atargatis like “Gaia” theorist James Lovelock and ex-Senator Albert “We-are-the-Enemy” Gore. Readers may take Evola as prescient when he writes that, “nothing is more indicative of the level of… neospiritualism than the human material of the majority of those who cultivate it.” Evola notes that, “mystification and superstition are constantly mingled in neospiritualism, another of whose traits, especially in the Anglo-Saxon countries, is the high percentage of women (women who are failures, dropouts, or ‘past it’).” In a metaphor, Evola compares these manifestations of “escapism, alienation, and confused compensation” to “the fluorescence that appears when corpses decay.” III. It might seem to have entailed an insuperable contradiction when, in my introduction, I wrote that Hermann Keyserling had shunned Evola because Evola’s investment in occult ideas stood in uncomfortable excess to Keyserling’s own; whereas, at the end of the foregoing section I reported on Evola’s critical hostility to “mysticism” and “superstition,” using his own terms from Ride the Tiger. There is no actual contradiction. Evola’s idea of Transcendence lies not so distant from similar ideas in the work of Giambattist Vico, Oswald Spengler, Arnold Toynbee, Eric Voegelin, and Richard Weaver. Evola, whose literary education was large, knows from the ancient texts that the sequence of intense visionary experience – followed by virile propagation of an at-first essentially religious order – lies at the inception of all known complex societies and civilizations. The similitude of mythic or prophetic foundations suggests that they all correspond to a singular source even though they cannot tell us, in modern rational language, what that source is. Whether it is Homer’s “Dike” (“Justice”) whose origin is Zeus, the Hebrew’s “I am that I am,” the Middle Kingdom’s “Dao,” or the beatific vision in Plato, Augustine, and Dante – the formative effect of the experience is to establish a notional hierarchy of structures, oriented to that which is “above” the human world, which, while announcing itself as eternal Being, takes physical form through human creative activity in the actual world. Founding visions organize people anagogically. That is an historical fact. Even Spengler, a rigorous skeptic, writes, in The Decline (Vol. I), that, “a Culture is born when a great soul awakens out of the proto-spirituality… and detaches itself, a form from the formless.” Toynbee, quirkily Catholic, writing in Civilization on Trial (1948), recognizes Christianity as a vision of life that “arose out of the spiritual travail which was a consequence of the breakdown of the Graeco-Roman civilization” and which forecast the shape of a successor-civilization amidst the ruins of the old. As for Voegelin, in Israel and Civilization (1956), he writes: “Cosmological symbolization is neither a theory nor an allegory. It is the mythical expression of the participation, experienced as real, of the order of society in the divine being that also orders the cosmos.” Evola, while prickly and eccentric, may nevertheless claim lively company in the convergent testimonies of so many legends and sagas from antiquity and the middle ages. Evola’s great work, Revolt against the Modern World, makes explicit the philological and anthropological bases of his convictions concerning Tradition. Evola divides Revolt into two parts: First, a comprehensive description of the structures and assumptions of those historical societies that body forth Tradition; Second, a “genealogy” of modern decadence. In Part One of Revolt, Evola draws heavily on James G. Frazer, Franz Cumont, Georges Dumézil, Fustel de Coulanges, and other scholars who, without prejudice, had attempted to understand primitive and archaic customs and institutions, as it were, from the inside out. Evola admires ancient and historical societies for the virility of their structures – royalty, aristocracy, priesthood, warrior, worker, and serf – which, in his view, allowed people to integrate themselves in a meaningful, living arrangement with others, including their superiors, with a minimum of invidious friction. Every station in the hierarchy has its privileges, but every station also has its obligations to the stations below it, just as each has its duties to the whole. Modern people find in social hierarchies, and such institutions as castes and guilds, something arbitrary and limiting, but Evola insists that traditional estates and vocations allowed for a natural sorting-out of talents and potentials and that they permitted people, by apprenticeship and initiation, to realize personal progress in a well-defined context. Evola also remarks that, especially in medieval society, certain institutions cut across the estates, so that a man whose trade, say, was a cobbler, might, as a member of one or another lay order, attain social recognition for activity outside that by which he earned his bread. Hans Sachs, in Richard Wagner’s Meistersinger, is by trade a shoemaker, but his peers celebrate him as an artist-adept of Stabreim and Minnelied. The Church, too, cut across the estates and offered avenues of mobility. By constant implication, Evola suggests that, insofar as happiness concerns us, people have been happier in traditional societies than they are, despite material comforts, in modern society. Evola is aware, as was Nietzsche, that the dissolution of forms exacerbates resentment and that modern people are more resentful than their predecessors. Evola goes so far as to defend the attitudes of Aristotle and the Old Testament to slavery, attitudes that occasion reflexive dudgeon in modern commentary: “Let us set aside the fact that Europeans reintroduced and maintained slavery up to the nineteenth century in their overseas colonies in such heinous forms as to be rarely found in the ancient world; what should be emphasized is that if there ever were a civilization of slaves on a grand scale, the one in which we are living is it.” Modern people wear the badge of their “dignity” brazenly. Yet “no traditional civilization ever saw such great masses of people condemned to perform shallow, impersonal, automatic jobs.” It is the case furthermore that, “in the contemporary slave system the counterparts of figures such as lords or enlightened rulers are nowhere to be found,” but only rather “the absurd structures of a more or less collectivized society.” Must one say that this makes no brief for slavery? Rather it condemns the parochialism and self-righteousness of liberals and democrats, and castigates the spiritually destructive tedium of the bureaucratic functions on which liberal-democratic society bases itself. In the same paragraph from which I draw the foregoing lines, Evola mentions the Soviet slave-labor camps, which attest for him the evil inherent in “the physical and moral subjection of man to the goals of collectivization.” As any admirer of chivalry must, Evola deplores feminism and female enfranchisement, both belonging, in his view, to the trend of the purely quantitative individual, with his infantilized egocentrism. “A practical and superficial lifestyle of a masculine type,” Evola writes, “has perverted [woman’s] nature and thrown her into the same male pit of work, profits, frantic activity, and politics.” It follows that, “modern woman in wanting to be for herself has destroyed herself” because “the ‘personality’ she so much yearned for is killing all semblance of female personality in her.” But Evola never spares anyone: “We must not forget that man is mostly responsible for [female] decadence… In a society run by real men, woman would never have yearned for or even been capable of taking the path she is following today.” As Kopff writes: “Evola rejected the Enlightenment Project lock, stock, and barrel, and had little use for the Renaissance and the Reformation. For Evola those really opposed to the leftist regime, the true Right, are not embarrassed to describe themselves as reactionary and counterrevolutionary.” IV. Part Two of Revolt against the Modern World traces the pedigree of the existing nihilism-crisis by providing “a bird’s eye view of history.” Naturally, Evola refuses to follow standard historiography, dismissing roundly its most basic assumption – namely that the original human societies were primitive and that civilization is a late stage in the social development of humanity. Evola similarly rejects the related Darwinian idea that complex entities evolve from primitive entities. In both instances he sees things the other way around, not out of egocentric crankiness, but rather as he writes, because Tradition itself, to which he defers, sees things the other way around. He takes seriously, for example, the archaic poet Hesiod’s five phases of humanity from the didactic poem Works and Days; he takes seriously Plato’s “Atlantis” story from the tandem dialogues Timaeus and Critias, and he admits as respectable similar model polities or societies that the variety of myth and literature locates in an antediluvian age. In the Hesiodic scheme, the earliest men were those of the Golden Race after which came the Silver, Bronze, Heroic, and Iron Races. Hesiod famously vows that he wished he did not belong to the degenerate Iron Race, so wicked and unsalvageable is it. In Plato’s “Atlantis” story, the original Atlanteans are demigods, who live in a technically and morally perfected state; but their descendants become gross, materialistic, and degenerate. Before one dismisses this framework as an instance of irremediable credulity, one should carefully note two things. The first is that unlike the ideologues whom he criticizes, who place their Social Justice or their Master Race in the indefinite future, Evola places the irreproducible model-polity in an irretrievable past, from which locus it can justify no reality-altering agenda; it can only serve as a remote measure for conscientious persons who seek standards other than contemporary ones. The second is that Evola thinks by habit in mythopoeic terms, as did Plato and Giambattist Vico; and it is through symbols and metaphors that he defeats the mechanistic-literalistic pseudo-cognition that he deplores. Like Plato and Vico – and like P. D. Ouspensky, who also entertained the idea of cycles of civilization and destruction, and who was certainly not a fantasist – Evola would advise honest people to begin their contemplation of human achievement from a position of humbleness rather than arrogance. I note that this tenet, central to Evola’s ethos, excuses him from the charge of Gnosticism. Despite Evola’s many references to esoteric knowledge, he never qualifies such knowledge as miraculously or uniquely vouchsafed him. He asserts that he has teased it out of myth, saga, and folklore by diligent study. One might also note that in the last fifty years archeology has steadily deepened the chronologies of complex human associations and of material achievement; and that in the same period the once-discredited idea of a primordial human language from which all others descend has reappeared, quite respectably, in the “Nostratic” and “World” hypotheses. Why, one might ask, as long as the theory of African Genesis remains formally unobjectionable, should anyone object to Evola’s theory of Far-Northern or Hyperborean ethogenesis, formally speaking? The theory of the Hyperborean Ur-Tradition explains cultural diffusion as adequately as the standing theory; the preference for which is a matter largely of sanctified prejudice. Indeed, a “boreal” first formation of high culture in no way makes impossible a prior equatorial appearance of Homo sapiens, considered under a purely biological category. As Evola points out, many southern people place their culture-ancestors in a northern homeland. Of course, the main interest in Revolt, Part Two, is in the diagnosis of modern corruption. What is Evola’s history of that corruption? In a remote first collapse in “the regression of the castes,” as Evola calls the long-term degenerative process, “the regality of blood replaced the regality of spirit,” and this alteration corresponded with an insurgency of “The Civilization of the Mother” over the original “Patriciate.” Much later – in the Late Medieval Period – “a second collapse occurred as the aristocracies began to fall and the monarchies to shake at the foundations,” when “through revolutions and constitutions they became useless institutions subject to the ‘will of the nation.’” Next comes the collapse from an already-narrowed nation-consciousness to the paradoxical undifferentiated collectivism of the bourgeois society of mere individuals, where equality is the tyrannical Shibboleth and absolute conformity the mode. Next, out of the incipient collectivism of the bourgeois society, comes “the proletarian revolt against capitalism,” in which Evola discerns “a reduction of horizon and value to the plane of matter, the machine, and the reign of quantity.” The phenomenon is a nadir, entirely “subhuman.” Thus, “in the leaders of the Bolshevik revolution it is possible to detect a ruth less ideological coherence.” As his early article “Bolschevismus ed Americanismus” should lead one to guess, Evola never spares the United States: “America too, in the essential way it views life and the world, has created a ‘civilization’ that represents the exact contradiction of the ancient European tradition.” In words reminiscent of Spengler’s diction, Evola describes the United States “a soulless greatness of a purely technological and collective nature, lacking in any background of transcendence.” Whereas “Soviet communism officially professes atheism,” Evola remarks, and whereas “America does not go that far”; nevertheless, “without realizing it, and often believing the contrary, it is running down the same path in which nothing is left of… religious meaning.” According to Evola, “the great majority of Americans could be said to represent a refutation on a large scale of the Cartesian principle… they ‘do not think and are.’” Evola links American anti-intellectualism with the proliferation in the United States of “the feminist idiocy,” which travels in tandem with “the materialistic and practical degradation of man.” In its conclusion, Evola’s Revolt forecasts a new “dark age,” for which his preferred term is the Vedic Kali Yuga. America will assimilate the crusading impulse of Soviet communism and will begin to try to universalize its destructive pseudo-values through imperialistic aggression; the Imperium will be a short-lived calamity leading to global wreckage. When Evola speaks thusly in 1934, one listens, and dismissing him becomes difficult. What is one to do then with a writer of foresight, whose literacy and education remain indubitable, who nevertheless serves up his social and political analysis, however trenchant it is, in the context of an alternate history, the details of which resemble the background of story by Lord Dunsany or Clark Ashton Smith? I am strongly tempted to answer my own question in this way: That perhaps we should begin by reassessing Dunsany and Smith, especially Smith, whose tales of decadent remnant-societies – half-ruined, eroticized, brooding over a shored-up luxuriance, and succumbing to momentary appetite with fatalistic abandon – speak with powerful intuition to our actual circumstances. I do not mean to say, however, that Evola is only metaphorically true, as though his work, like Smith’s, were fiction. I mean that Evola is truly true, on the order of one of Plato’s “True Myths,” no matter how much his truth disconcerts us. Submitted by kappert on Sat, 2010-04-03 08:13.

Thank you Professor, an addendum as valuable as the original text. My take on Evola and writers similiar to him in the first half of the 20th century is that they take a line remarkably similiar to conservative Catholic thought from the 19th century, particularly in respect to the negative effects of the Enlightenment and the French Revolution. I always find it amusing when they go running back to the ancient Greeks to trace their intellectual lineage as if they sprang from the head of Plato or Aristotle themselves, instead of the conservative Catholic reaction, and at times overreaction , which most likely had just as an important role in shaping their thinking. I hope Mr. Spencer adds your Evola article and additional comments to his site, the comments make what was an interesting article a great article. obscure p.s. (I guess not) Submitted by Thomas F. Bertonneau on Wed, 2010-03-31 13:04. As my wife, a PhD in French language and literature, said to me apropos Julius Evola after reading the Brussels Journal essay devoted to him, “He seems to have been a controversial figure.” “Yes,” I replied, leaving it at the monosyllable. I propose, however, that just as all monosyllables are not equal (some are polite and functional while others are vulgar and gratuitous), neither is all controversy equal, and neither are all the ways of responding to controversy equal. One respondent to “Against Nihilism” would dismiss its subject, the author of Men among the Ruins, because contemporary goons cite him. Other goons, in remote towns in Idaho, cite the Gospel. So what? What educated person takes his cues from the morally unsalvageable? Permit me to rehearse an anecdote whose relevance will become apparent. Earlier this month, in his new webzine Alternative Right, Richard Spencer (with whom in all things I certainly do not agree) ran in two installments (Part I, Part II) my study of American writer T. Lothrop Stoddard. Stoddard propelled himself on the public scene in 1914 with his history of The French Revolution in San Domingo, a brilliant study of the origins of that perpetual catastrophe, Haiti, and of the fanaticism of the Jacobins, in Paris and in the islands, during that terrible decade the 1790s. In the first half of the article, I praised Stoddard for the objectivity of his meticulously documented study of revolutionary disintegration in the colonial society. I also appended a long footnote discussing my San-Domingo ancestry – the Bertonneau family began as part of the Créole Diaspora from Haiti during that phase of its establishment that consisted in the systematic slaughter of the remaining whites and mixed-race people. In the second half of the article, I traced Stoddard’s sad descent, through his advocacy of eugenics, to an apologist for Nazi Germany. Almost as swiftly as the article appeared, it was reposted on several websites, generated (I imagine) out of remote towns in Idaho, whose administrators seemed to regard it as an attestation of their vulgar cause. Socially unreconstructed former East German skinheads and Idaho goons are alike illiterate: they cannot competently read the text whether it is Evola on the calamity of the post-Enlightenment world-order or that obscure but grammatical amateur T. F. Bertonneau on T. Lothrop Stoddard; of course, as they stutter their way through the text, moving their lips, it never occurs to the skinheads and goons to read the footnotes. If, however, one applied to me and to my essay on Stoddard a certain irate argument about Evola – that Evola may be dismissed under the vocabulary of feculence because feculent ignoramuses cite him – then I, myself, would, according to the syllogism, stand convicted of entertaining feculent doctrines. Need I say that it is a defective syllogism? On related topics – Evola being forty years dead, why worry whether he comported himself arrogantly or held an exaggerated view of his own person? I note in “Against Nihilism” that Evola’s feudal title was self-bestowed and it follows by implication that he was something of a fraud, in that respect. Again, so what? Richard Nixon’s first Vice President Spiro Agnew once in an interview said that he thought politicians ought to be scrupulously honorable and above the boards in all their dealings. That he said “Nolo contendere” shortly thereafter to a federal judge does not invalidate the statement. Equally, that Evola was human and all-too-human, as might have been the case, in no way invalidates the incisiveness of his analyses and insights. Evola’s remarks on democracy and socialism, Existentialism and beatnik-ism are either valid or they are not. I find them valid. If someone did not, it might at least be polite to offer a few words as to why. As for denouncing Evola because he advocated elitism and thought of himself as one of the elites – this scarily resembles the cheapest kind of Leftwing invective. All societies have elites. The question is what kind of elites do they have? I thank “Mpresley” for his appreciative remarks and for his additional relevant instances and “Traveller” for posing on my behalf the question that the college English teacher must repeatedly pose to his classrooms of stultified sophomores: Did you actually do the reading?

Since [Italy] lacks an authentic ""traditional"" past, there are some who, in their attempt to organize themselves against the avant-garde of world subversion, and in order to claim some concrete and historical basis, have found a reference point in the priciples and institutions of the Fascist era. I wish to uphold the following fundamental principle: if the ""Fascist ideas"" still deserve to be defended, they should not be defended simply insofar as they are ""Fascist,"" but rather insofar as they have represented a particular form of the apparition and affirmation of ideas that were older and more elevated than Fascism, ideas that have the character of ""constants,"" so that they may found again as integral parts of a great European political tradition. To those for whom everything begins and ends with Fascism, including those whose political horizons are confined by the mere polemics between Fascism and anti-fascism and who have no other reference point beside these two poles--these people would hardly be able to distinguish the best potential of the Italian world of the past from some of its aspects that were affected by the same evils that it is necessary to fight against today.

Let me echo mpresley's thanks to Prof. Bertonneau for this interesting and compelling article. It takes more than a drop of courage to touch someone with Nazi and Fascist connections even with a ten-foot pole, but this excursion was well worth it. (I recently recommended Ernst Junger's Storm of Steel to someone, who quoted back her professor's epithet for Junger as ""that old Nazi."") Evola sounds right about many things and I look forward to reading something by him. I was surprized to see how many of his books are available in current editions on abebooks.com. By the way, I recently saw I Know Where I'm Going on Prof. Bertonneau's recommendation. First rate, with the added bonus of live action footage of shaggy Highland cattle.

Esoterical neonazi - that's Evola, the Baron of Rome. As aristocrat he belonged to the Italian elite and surely felt himself as splendid Übermensch, supporting not the wishiwashi Italian fasci but the 'real' German Nazi-Ideology. After the war he inspired the right-wing extremists to bloody boombings (Ordine nuove). Race as Anti-Universalism is still alive among his followers, papers like 'Junge-Freiheit' and 'Criticón' worship him as fascist guru, as well as the Russian neo-eurasiast Alexander G Dugin. Crap!

On the contrary, Evola was an advocate for both fasicsm and national socialism. Despite various disagreements with the PNF and a notion of racial superiority based on “spiritualism” rather than “science”, he had Mussolini’s support, and later worked as a researcher in Germany for the SS’ Ahnenerbe. I find no evidence that Evola sought to resurrect or even understood Europe’s intellectual and spiritual traditions. Indeed, Evola’s rejection of Christianity (esp. Catholicism) and its Judaic origins, and his reference to Hinduism and other non–European religions and philosophies is incomprehensible to me. On balance, Evola strikes me as a proponent of pre–Christian Greek philosophical arguments in favor of enlightened or virtuous dictatorship and social stratification. Not unlike many so–called “intellectuals”, he was unable to come to terms with the evolution of Christianity in Europe, the Enlightenment and its products (liberty and equality), and the economic transition from feudalism to capitalism. Evola can only contribute subjective, intangible (i.e. spiritual) and groundless notions. Submitted by mpresley on Mon, 2010-03-29 22:59. In a society where Tradition governs, the “axiom… is that the supreme values… are not liable to change and becoming.” In this context it is even difficult to speak using words such as ""values"" as they will likely be misunderstood by moderns. Values in the modern sense have no ontological status within traditional philosophy; values manifest with a fluidity, flowing from the subjective wants and desires of the valuing ""individual."" However, within traditional thought, and to make it more recognizable to moderns, perhaps the word ""standard"" is more fitting. But this is nothing new, and traditional thinking is very difficult for us to confront. I'm reminded of a passage from professor Strauss' lectures on Plato's Symposium, where a graduate student began his question asking about values in Plato. Strauss cut him short, lecturing him on the difference. “The error and illusion are the same,” namely that “material want” is the cause of all “existential misery” and that abundance generates happiness and lawfulness. Again, I'm reminded of the Chinese Communists and their real attempts to deny and crush anything of the spirit. Indeed, there are those who argue that Deng Xiaoping's ""Socialism with Chinese Characteristics"" was simply a practical way to ""channel"" both the Chinese people's physical poverty and their repressed (outlawed) spirituality resulting from the disastrous Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution; a way to substitute spiritual poverty with material ""things,"" and also as a way to maintain civic order. However the brutal suppression of Falun Dafa shows how little the regime is willing to cede in these matters. In any case, Evola will never be read, understood, or accepted by many. But that is really his point. Thank you, Dr. Bertonneau, for the succinct overview. The Brussels Journal is written by Europeans, living in as well as outside Europe.

"Sign In Debate to restart on Mexico border Manage Newsletters Shameless politicians use 9/11 to lecture America about “unity” Biden’s forced COVID-19 vaccine attack on minorities Dems’ totalitarian overreach threatens Americans’ livelihood President Obama is pledging border security and pleading for help from Republicans as he steps up his campaign to pass an immigration reform bill, but new polling suggests the rift within his own party is actually deeper than within the GOP on the issue. The data from the Pew Center for the People and the Press’ massive look at political parties, released last week, found that the gap between the ends of the Democratic coalition on favoring stricter enforcement and on legalization is twice as large as the gap between hard-line Republicans and their more libertarian-leaning cohorts. Mr. Obama will visit the border on Tuesday and deliver an immigration speech in El Paso, Texas, as the latest step in his push for action. But he is increasingly running up against some on his left flank who say he can take steps right now, without Congress, to halt deportations - a move immigrant-rights advocates say Hispanic voters will need to see before the next election. TOP STORIES AOC wears 'Tax the rich' dress to ritzy Met Gala 'No SALT, no deal': Vulnerable Dems threaten revolt unless $3.5T bill cuts blue-states taxes CNN poll: America turns irate, glum “The debate over whether the president has powers under existing law to provide relief from deportation for certain immigrants is over. He does,” said Rep. Luis V. Gutierrez, Illinois Democrat and a key voice for immigrant rights in Congress. “The question is how broadly and how generously he will use those powers. That is what I will be listening for.” Hispanic groups say the president promised them during the 2008 campaign that he would work for an immigration bill during his first year in office, but that failed to happen as he focused instead on the economic stimulus and health care. Now, though, the president is trying to make up for lost time. In recent weeks, he has held meetings at the White House with nationally prominent politicians such as New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger; Hispanic entertainers, including Eva Longoria; and members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. Those meetings have drawn the ire of Republicans, who said they are one-sided and not likely to produce the bipartisan cooperation that the president says will be needed to pass a bill. The Pew survey data on political parties indicates that a broad majority of Americans, from both parties, want stiffer immigration enforcement, but also want illegal immigrants to be granted a path to citizenship as long as they pay fines and show they are holding a job. Still, while 94 percent of self-identified liberals wanted a path to citizenship, just 61 percent of so-called “hard-pressed” Democrats did. That is about twice the gap between conservatives and libertarians in the GOP’s coalition. On enforcement, the gap was just as stark: Just 55 percent of liberals wanted to continue the crackdown, while 88 percent of hard-pressed Democrats did, compared with a 7 point gap between main street Republicans and conservatives on the GOP’s side. Steven A. Camarota, research director at the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors stricter limits on immigration, said the proof that Democrats are divided can be found in the fact that despite holding huge numerical advantages, they didn’t try to bring a legalization bill to the floor in the last Congress until the lame-duck session, when it was easy for Republicans to block it. Mr. Camarota said the difference between the two parties is largely a matter of perception, fueled by the stances of party leaders. “It’s hard to think of anybody prominent in the Democratic Party who doesn’t favor the amnesty approach, where in the Republican Party you get leaders all over the place. George W. Bush was where Obama is, for example,” he said. “What this means is, it gives the superficial appearance that one party is more united than the other, and when it actually comes time to vote in Congress it doesn’t play out that way.” Mr. Obama says there used to be a bigger consensus on the issue when he was in the Senate, including in 2006 when the Republican-led chamber with President Bush’s backing, passed a legalization bill. But since then, the GOP’s backing in Congress has fallen off. Facing that, the president hopes to rally outside groups to build pressure on both parties, but the GOP in particular. “There was political opposition to comprehensive immigration reform, including from some places where there used to be political support. We are endeavoring to change that dynamic by rallying public support, by raising public awareness about the need for comprehensive immigration reform,” White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters Monday in previewing the trip to El Paso. Mr. Obama has previously ruled out taking unilateral action to halt deportations of broad classes of illegal immigrants, such as students or young adults who would be eligible for legal status under the Dream Act, which has yet to pass Congress. But he told the Hispanic lawmakers last week that he would reconsider their request. Alfonso Aguilar, executive director of the Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles, who worked on immigration issues in the Bush administration, said the president is losing support among Hispanics because he hasn’t made good on his promises. Mr. Aguilar said that Mr. Obama polled at nearly 75 percent among Hispanics after his election, but that has now dropped to below 50 percent. “It’s going to require more from the president to get Latinos to actually believe in him with regard to immigration,” Mr. Aguilar said. He said he expects Mr. Obama to continue making a push for legislation while blaming the GOP for not negotiating. “This is pure politics in the most crass way of doing it,” Mr. Aguilar said. Mr. Obama voted for immigration bills when he was in the Senate in 2006 and 2007, but has yet to offer a specific legislative plan as president for what he wants to see Congress pass. The key questions are fourfold: What further action needs to be taken on border security; how should interior enforcement be stepped up; what requirements will illegal immigrants have to meet in order to get on a path to citizenship; and will there be a guest-worker program for future workers, and will they also have access to citizenship.

"INDIANAPOLIS | Overturning a common law dating back to the English Magna Carta of 1215, the Indiana Supreme Court ruled Thursday that Hoosiers have no right to resist unlawful police entry into their homes. In a 3-2 decision, Justice Steven David writing for the court said if a police officer wants to enter a home for any reason or no reason at all, a homeowner cannot do anything to block the officer's entry. ""We believe ... a right to resist an unlawful police entry into a home is against public policy and is incompatible with modern Fourth Amendment jurisprudence,"" David said. ""We also find that allowing resistance unnecessarily escalates the level of violence and therefore the risk of injuries to all parties involved without preventing the arrest."" David said a person arrested following an unlawful entry by police still can be released on bail and has plenty of opportunities to protest the illegal entry through the court system. The court's decision stems from a Vanderburgh County case in which police were called to investigate a husband and wife arguing outside their apartment. When the couple went back inside their apartment, the husband told police they were not needed and blocked the doorway so they could not enter. When an officer entered anyway, the husband shoved the officer against a wall. A second officer then used a stun gun on the husband and arrested him. Professor Ivan Bodensteiner, of Valparaiso University School of Law, said the court's decision is consistent with the idea of preventing violence. ""It's not surprising that they would say there's no right to beat the hell out of the officer,"" Bodensteiner said. ""(The court is saying) we would rather opt on the side of saying if the police act wrongfully in entering your house your remedy is under law, to bring a civil action against the officer."" Justice Robert Rucker, a Gary native, and Justice Brent Dickson, a Hobart native, dissented from the ruling, saying the court's decision runs afoul of the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. ""In my view the majority sweeps with far too broad a brush by essentially telling Indiana citizens that government agents may now enter their homes illegally -- that is, without the necessity of a warrant, consent or exigent circumstances,"" Rucker said. ""I disagree."" Rucker and Dickson suggested if the court had limited its permission for police entry to domestic violence situations they would have supported the ruling. But Dickson said, ""The wholesale abrogation of the historic right of a person to reasonably resist unlawful police entry into his dwelling is unwarranted and unnecessarily broad."" This is the second major Indiana Supreme Court ruling this week involving police entry into a home. On Tuesday, the court said police serving a warrant may enter a home without knocking if officers decide circumstances justify it. Prior to that ruling, police serving a warrant would have to obtain a judge's permission to enter without knocking. Subscribe to our Daily Headlines newsletter.

"by Brett Stevens on May 13, 2011 The last decade brought so many changes we will be estimating them for another decade or two. After the Cold War ended in 1991, we had a decade of thinking the age of threats was over. With technology, and liberal democracy, we were all protected from the horrors of the past. Then some guys flew a plane or two into a building (or two). We embarked on a huge war, only to find out that we were not fighting organized states or religions, but independent activists who wanted modern society to keep its corrupting influence away from their people. This was as much about knowing that porn ruins girls’ self esteem and Coca-Cola makes people lazy as it was about dislike of the USA. Now that war is going to migrate elsewhere. In short, all the stuff that caused our wars back at the start of the lastcentury is back — and thanks to our technology, expanding population and greater media awareness, it’s more potent than before. This comes at a time when our oil supplies are dwindling, we’re out of timber, overfishing and overhunting are further limitations and we have better weapons. It’s a perfect storm brewing. The two “sides” in our political debate are of no use. In the USA, we have neoconservative Republicans and neosocialist Democrats; Europe has more political parties, but they are either rightist or leftist, with most being more leftist than rightist. The left wants to advance an agenda of “progress”: more equality, more wealth redistribution, pacifism and solidarity with the workers; the right are muddled, but want national identity and some kind of social Darwinist meritocracy. No clear winner has emerged because all sides are tied to pointless issues. These issues are symbolic, not real. The left has tied itself to multiculturalism, which is failing; the American right panders to social conservatives with token issues like abortion and gay marriage, but fails to address the underlying problem; the greens somehow let themselves get swept up into the leftist mania for wealth redistribution. If you think mainstream politics is bad, the underground is even worse. The far-left are either insane anarchists who think that society will magically become perfect if we just get rid of standards, and the far-right are — well, we’ve covered this before. Blaming Jews for all of your problems, getting angry at other ethnic groups for the failures of diversity, and most of all insisting on an uncompromising and violent dogma, for good reasons, drives voters and everyone but the loudmouths away. In contrast to this, we at .org have a sensible platform: These are the kind of ideas from which we can construct a future. They do not rely on the failures of the past, or the reaction to those failures, or those who just want society to stop advancing in any way. We want people who can grasp the future and yet apply the eternal values of human success to it, learning from our past and using it to shape our future without giving in to the entropy of hopeless obedience. This platform is inherently anti-leftist as it denies the silly notion that we’re all equal. We choose our friends carefully; that alone shows us how equality is a farce. Not just any person will do when you want friends, mates or business partners. Instead of trying to force us all to be OK, we should start trying to force ourselves to evolve so we can get past our problems as individuals and thus, as a species. We are the future, those who can grasp this platform and others like it, because we are thinking beyond the clash of civilizations, beyond the collapse of consumer society, beyond the decay of the West and beyond the trivial issues that leftism has imposed on modern politics. We are thinking like frontier settlers, kingmakers and conquerors again, which is to say that we’re thinking creatively or how we will construct something new, not fight over parts of the old. This outlook alone is so unique that modern politics cannot even visualize it. It is outside political discourse, which is based on carving up the pie, not baking a new one. Even more, it is based on measuring the consequences of our actions against creative values, or the type of society in which we hope to live. It’s about a choice of what whole type of civilization we want, not how we’ll tweak the existing one. As politics in the West winds down to another embittered stalemate, it’s those who seek a truer tomorrow who are breaking away from the decadent infrastructure and finding power elsewhere. We are the future because we are the only ones who can think about how to make that future. Join us. Tags: dogma, leftism, new politics, new right"
"Gingrich calls Obama as the 'most successful food stamp president in history.' By KENDRA MARR 05/13/2011 09:41 PM EDT MACON, Ga. – For the first time since launching his presidential campaign, Newt Gingrich hit the road Friday, telling several hundred GOP activists here that the “right policies lead to the right results.” The former 10-term congressman from an Atlanta-area district delivered a policy-heavy, 35-minute speech at the state Republican Party’s convention that echoed themes he’s been testing over the past few days — the importance of smaller government and 10th Amendment limits on federal power — and which echoed the vintage Gingrich, author of the 1994 “Contract With America” that ended House Democrats’ 40-year reign. The Republican Party’s oft-decribed “ideas man” played to his strengths in a speech replete with historical references, blasting President Barack Obama’s economic and foreign policies, and predicting that the GOP will win in 2012 because voters will judge the candidates on “policy basis, not personality.” And, classic Gingrich, he wasn’t shy about offering a few apocalyptic warnings: “This will be the most consequential election since 1860,” and that the current White House is taking the country toward a “European socialist system.” While the Obama administration “believes politicians define the future,” a Gingrich administration would know “the power starts at home, is invested in its citizens,” he said. Gingrich said his jobs plan includes halting any future tax increases, cutting the capital gains tax, and eliminating the estate tax. He called for reducing regulation and the corporate income tax, as well as creating an American energy policy that focuses on developing resources at home. “The most important social welfare program in America is a job,” he said to cheers. He stressed a message of getting Americans back to work. Touting his experience, he told the crowd that as speaker, he helped bring unemployment down below 4 percent. Comparing the country’s dire economic straits to the ones then-candidate Ronald Reagan faced in the 1980s, Gingrich sounded the alarm that “left-wing intellectuals” are weakening the country. Gingrich called Obama as the “most successful food stamp president in history,” and followed up with, “I want to be the most successful paycheck president in history,” Gingrich said. As for a national security policy? “We should have one,” he said to cheers. Gingrich saved some of his harshest words for the Pakistani government, which he alleged allowed Osama bin Laden to hide in plain sight. Noting the billions in aid the U.S. has lavished on Pakistan for decades, Gingrich said, “I was trying to figure out what the word ally meant. I know what the word sucker meant. How stupid do you think we are?” Gingrich acknowledge that’s his role as architect of the Republican Revolution, but he stressed that Georgians get to know the new Newt as well. “I’m not sure we can elect Speaker Gingrich. But I know we can elect Newt,” he said. It was a homecoming of sorts for Gingrich. While the Republican crowd applauded his plans for fiscal austerity and devotion to the Declaration of Independence, many were more eagerly anticipating Pizza mogul Herman Cain’s speech on Saturday.

"Here’s an intriguing chart from Vanessa Williamson, Theda Skocpol and John Coggin, via the Monkey Cage. It shows coverage of the tax day rallies put on by the tea party movement in 2009 on both CNN and Fox. The nickel version is that CNN gave the rallies a lot of coverage on the day of the events plus a little bit of followup the next day. In other words, they treated the rallies as a news event. But Fox’s approach was a wee bit different: In telling contrast, Fox News shows significant and growing coverage in the lead-up to the April rallies. … FoxNews has explicitly mobilized its viewers by connecting the Tea Party to their own brand identity. … Rather than serving a journalistic, or even a propagandistic function, Fox News in effect acts as a “national social movement organization,” as described by sociologist Debra Minkoff in studies of liberal identity movements. For a scattered set of people who might feel isolated or marginalized (like gays and lesbians, in Minkoff’s original example), a resourceful national organization can help to provide “an infrastructure for collective action” by promoting “the diffusion of collective identities” and fostering “at least a minimal degree of solidarity and integration.” Fox News and its audience are all one big happy family, and Fox views its job as rallying its base, not as simply providing them with news. I don’t think anyone will be especially surprised to hear that, but this is an interesting lens for understanding the difference between how a news organization covers the news and how an activist organization like Fox covers the news.

"You know, in about 15 years or so, Barack Obama might actually come up with an energy policy that increases energy and grows the economy. After five months of escalating political heat, Obama finally decided that we could drill our way out of our problems — or at least his problems: Facing continued public unhappiness over gas prices, President Barack Obama is directing his administration to ramp up U.S. oil production by extending existing leases in the Gulf of Mexico and off Alaska’s coast and holding more frequent lease sales in a federal petroleum reserve in Alaska. Obama said Saturday that the measures “make good sense” and will help reduce U.S. consumption of imported oil in the long term. But he acknowledged anew that they won’t help to immediately bring down gasoline prices topping $4 a gallon in many parts of the country. Is this leadership? No, it’s more like covering one’s party mascot: His announcement followed passage in the Republican-controlled House of three bills — including two this week — that would expand and speed up offshore oil and gas drilling. Republicans say the bills are aimed at easing gasoline costs, but they also acknowledge that won’t be immediate. The White House had announced its opposition to all three bills, which are unlikely to pass the Democratic-controlled Senate, saying the measures would undercut safety reviews and open environmentally sensitive areas to new drilling. Wow — sounds bad, huh? Why would anyone listen to Republican policies that do all that? But Obama is adopting some of the bills’ provisions. In fact, most of this action deals with extensions for existing leases, rather than new drilling. Instead of approving extension requests individually, Obama will issue blanket one-year extensions in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico. The lease sales for the Gulf that Obama announced were supposed to take place last year. They’re not new leases. Obama did pledge to hold annual lease sales in Alaska’s North Slope area, where they had been ad hoc in the past, which is the only hint of new expansion in his remarks. This isn’t leadership. It’s a threadbare attempt at triangulation that doesn’t add much new capacity at all, nor does it speed up the process of exploration and extraction. The White House will drag its heels on expansion of American production as long as possible; this announcement just buys Obama some time and a respite from the political fallout of high gas prices. Still, the fact that Obama had to protect himself in this manner shows how politically damaging his refusal to expand American production has become, and how damaging it will continue to be. "
"Advertisement Supported by By Jim Rutenberg Former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas said Saturday night that he would not seek the Republican nomination for president next year in an announcement that had been hotly anticipated — in part because of contradicting hints he gave right up to the minute he finally made his intentions known. “All the factors say go, but my heart says no,” Mr. Huckabee said on his nighttime program on Fox News Channel. “And that’s the decision that I have made.” As of Saturday afternoon, even some of Mr. Huckabee’s closest aides did not know what he would say. He kept them waiting as long as possible, making the announcement at the very end of his hourlong 8 p.m. program after interviewing guests including the “Extra” host Mario Lopez and the rock musician Ted Nugent — with whom he jammed on Mr. Nugent’s old hit song “Cat Scratch Fever.” (Mr. Huckabee plays the bass guitar). Even during his statement, Mr. Huckabee hinted that perhaps he would run. “The past few weeks, the external signs and signals and answers to many of the obstacles point strongly toward running,” he said after citing his strength in recent polls and what he said were hints of strong financial support for any run he might make. But, he said, upon reflection he realized that “under the best of circumstances, being president is a job that takes one to the limit of his or her human capacity. For me to do it apart from an inner confidence that I was undertaking it with God’s full blessing is simply unthinkable.” Mr. Huckabee had been showing strong poll numbers, among some of the strongest of his party’s possible contenders. His decision helps bring the fluid field of prospective Republican presidential candidates a step closer to solidifying, eliminating one possible — and most likely potent — contender from the mix, but leaving several other highly anticipated announcements outstanding, starting with those of Gov. Mitch Daniels of Indiana and former Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska. Former Gov. Jon M. Huntsman Jr. of Utah, who recently left his post as President Obama’s ambassador to China, is said to be seriously considering a run and is making moves that seem to indicate he is leaning toward doing so. John R. Bolton, a former ambassador to the United Nations, said in a brief interview Saturday night that Mr. Huckabee’s announcement made him more likely to enter the race. “Anyone else considering it has to get serious about it,” he said. (An aide to Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota said Friday that she would be more likely to run, as well, if Mr. Huckabee decided against doing so.) Had Mr. Huckabee entered the race, he would have been filling a perceptible void in the Republican field by becoming the presumed candidate of evangelicals, whose social issues have been largely swept aside as both parties focus most acutely on the economy and government spending. Mr. Huckabee, an ordained Baptist minister and veteran of religious broadcasting, has carefully maintained ties to his colleagues in the religious sphere. “He knows our issues backward and forward, and he knows our people backward and forward because he is one of them,” said the Rev. Richard D. Land, the president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention. Mr. Huckabee’s decision to forgo a run for president presumably leaves that space wide open for Ms. Palin, a self-described “Bible-believing Christian,” should she jump into the race. Still, Dr. Land said there were candidates already running who could and would address the critical evangelical constituency, among them the former House speaker Newt Gingrich — who has been actively reaching out to Christian groups — and former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, who has been outspoken against same-sex marriage and about other conservative social causes. Still, evangelicals have yet to rally to the side of any of the candidates thus far. In that regard, they resemble the party in general. “It’s anyone’s game at this point,” said Matthew Dowd, a former political adviser to President George W. Bush. Advertisement"
"Thanks to James Best’s masterpiece, Tempest at Dawn, I felt like the 56th delegate at the Constitutional Convention. Using vivid narrative and expressive dialogue, Tempest at Dawn presents all the major issues the Founding Fathers struggled with. More impressive, you get to know the character of the men who created our great nation. Tempest at Dawn is based primarily on Madison’s notes to the Convention. Mr. Best adds to the story events that happened outside of the State House. It is a true credit to the author that it is difficult to tell where Madison’s notes end and the author’s speculations begin. Keeping in mind that Tempest at Dawn is historical fiction, it is a must read for anybody who wants to understand the principles and efforts that went into creating the Constitution and struggles to create our nation.

"MIAMI (CBS4)- A Miami-Dade mayoral candidate along with students are expected to protest a campaign forum Wednesday to express their outrage and disapproval of FIU hosting a Spanish-only event. The debate, held at FIU’s Wertheim Theatre, broadcast by Univision radio and set for rebroadcast by Univision channel 23 television, was open only to candidates Julio Robaina, Marcelo Llorente, Carlos Gimenez and Jose “Pepe” Cancio. “I was appalled,” said Luther Campbell, a former rap star and African American candidate for mayor. “The university is having a Cuban-only forum, which is wrong to the students, because the students are from all different races and all different cultures and all the students don’t speak only Spanish.” In its release announcing the forum, Univision said the “participants were selected based on the amount of funds raised” by their campaigns. The four top fund-raisers are the only Hispanics in the race. Cancio – in fourth place in fund raising – is a distant fourth. A spokesperson for FIU said the school was only providing a location for the debate, and was otherwise not involved. Campbell called that laughable, given that FIU’s brass put out a notice touting the event. In an email to students, faculty and staff, Sandra Gonzalez-Levy, an FIU vice-president, wrote, “We encourage you to attend and be part of the political process taking place in our community. Be involved!” Roosevelt Bradley, another African American candidate told CBS4 News he was “outraged” that FIU’s president would allow such a “polarizing and divisive event” to be held on the campus of a public, state-run university. Bradley said “this turns the clock back 50 years” on race and ethnic relations in the community. Some students said they found the Hispanic-only forum troubling. We have a large Hispanic community, but this is Miami and we like to celebrate our diversity here,” said student Esra Erdogan. “I don’t think it’s right to exclude any candidate.” Beyond denying any “real involvement” in the debate, a spokesperson for FIU declined comment. The school did not respond to requests by CBS4 News for comment on criticisms raised by Campbell, Bradley and a third African-American candidate, Wilbur Bell. Univision also declined to address the criticism, beyond saying that the participants were selected by the size of their campaign chests. The company also said an English language transcript of the debate would be provided after the event was over. After the forum, CBS4 News spoke with some of the Spanish-speaking candidates. “Whenever we’re invited, we show up, oftentimes not knowing who else is invited. Whenever we have an opportunity to communicate to our community, we’re happy to attend,” said Marcelo Llorente, Miami-Dade mayoral candidate. “Well what I was told is that the criteria wasn’t whether you spoke Spanish or not, it was the four leading fund raisers,” said Carlos Gimenez, Miami-Dade mayoral candidate. Other candidates vying for the spot as Miami-Dade mayor include Eddie Lewis, Farid Khavari, Jeffrey Lampert and Gabrielle Redfern. On Tuesday, the candidates met at a debate. The debate, sponsored by the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce, featured five of the candidates: Gimenez, Cancio, Bradley, Llorente and Robaina. Five other candidates were not present: Eddie Lewis, Wilbur “Short Stop” Bell, Farid Khavari, Jeffrey Lampert and Gabrielle Redfern. Redfern appeared after the debate and complained that said she had not been invited. “I thought this election would be open to all, not a few,” she said. Chamber president and CEO Barry Johnson told Redfern that “everyone was invited.” The candidate said they were not. Meanwhile, Campbell, the former frontman for rap group 2 Live Crew, was invited but didn’t show up until the conclusion of the debate. He walked in as candidates prepared to give closing remarks. Campbell apologized for being late but promptly took aim at the Chamber. “I’m a little disturbed,” Campbell said. “The Chamber says it is about the all the community. But I don’t think it’s been serving all the community, just some parts.” For more stories related to the Mayoral election, click here."
"From the desk of Geert Wilders on Fri, 2011-05-13 15:27 Do you know why America is in a better state than Europe? Because you enjoy more freedom than Europeans. And do you know why Americans enjoy more freedom than Europeans? Because you are still allowed to tell the truth. In Europe and Canada people are dragged to court for telling the truth about islam. I, too, have been dragged to court. I am an elected member of the house of representatives in the Netherlands. I am currently standing in court like a common criminal for saying that islam is a dangerous totalitarian ideology rather than a religion. The court case is still pending, but I risk a jail sentence of 16 months. Last week, my friend Lars Hedegaard, a journalist from Denmark, was fined because in a private conservation, which was recorded without his knowing, he had criticised the way women are treated in islamic societies. Recently, another friend, Elisabeth Sabaditsch-Wolff, a human rights activist from Austria, was fined because she had criticised islam’s founder Muhammad. She had said that Muhammad was a pedophile because he had married a 6-year old girl and raped her when she was 9. Unfortunately, there are many similar cases. I am especially happy to be in your midst because here I can say what I want to say without having to fear that I will be dragged to court upon leaving this church. My dear American friends, you cannot imagine how we envy your First Amendment. The day when America follows the example of Europe and Canada and introduces so-called “hate speech crimes” which is only used to punish people who are critical of islam, that day America will have lost its freedom. My friends, let us hope that this never happens. Last week, we celebrated Liberation Day in the Netherlands. We celebrated the liberation from the Nazi occupation in 1945. Many American soldiers, including many young Tennesseans, played a decisive role in the liberation of the Netherlands from nazi tyranny. We are immensely grateful for that. Young Americans gave their lives so that the Dutch might be free. I assure you: The Dutch people will never forget this. Unfortunately, however, the Europe which your fathers and grandfathers fought and died for is not the Europe we are living in today. I travel the world to tell people what Europe has become. I wish I could take you all on a visit to my country and show you what Europe has become. It has changed beyond recognition as a result of mass immigration. And not just any mass immigration, but mass immigration driven by the dangerous force of islam. My friends, I am sorry. I am here today with an unpleasant message. I am here with a warning. I am here with a battle cry: “Wake up, Christians of Tennessee. Islam is at your gate.” Do not make the mistake which Europe made. Do not allow islam to gain a foothold here. Islam is dangerous. Islam wants to establish a state on earth, ruled by islamic sharia law. Islam aims for the submission, whether by persuasion, intimidation or violence, of all non-Muslims, including Christians. The results can be seen in Europe. Islam is an ideology of conquest. It uses two methods to achieve this goal: the first method is the sword. Do you know what figures on the flag of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, a country where Christian churches are banned and Christians are not even allowed to wear a tiny crucifix? There is a huge sword on that flag, just below the Islamic creed. The message is clear. Without the sword islam would not have been able to spread its creed. The second method is immigration. Islam’s founder Muhammad himself taught his followers how to conquer through immigration when they moved from Mecca to Medina. This phenomenon of conquest through immigration is called al-Hijra. My learned friend Sam Solomon has written a perfect book about it. I had a copy of Sam’s book sent to all the members of the Dutch Parliament. But most of them are worse than Saint-Thomas in the Bible. Thomas did not believe what he had not seen. Most politicians refuse to believe the things they see before their very eyes. In Europe we have been experiencing al-Hijra for over 30 years now. Many of our cities have changed beyond recognition. “In each one of our cities” wrote the well-known Italian author Oriana Fallaci shortly before her death in 2006, “there is a second city, a state within the state, a government within the government. A Muslim city, a city ruled by the Koran.” – end of quote. How did the Europeans get into this situation? It is partly our own fault because we have foolishly adopted the concept of cultural relativism, which manifests itself in the ideology of multiculturalism. Cultural relativism advocates that all cultures are equal. However, cultures wither away and die if people no longer believe that its values are better than those of another culture. Islam is spreading like wildfire wherever people lack the guts to say that their values are better than the Islamic values. Islam is spreading like wildfire because the Koran explicitly tells Muslims that they are “the best of peoples ever raised up for mankind” and that non-Muslims are “the worst of creatures.” Islam is spreading like wildfire everywhere in the West where political, academic, cultural and media elites lack the guts to proudly proclaim, as I believe we all should proclaim: Our Judeo-Christian Western culture is far better and far superior to the islamic culture. We must be proud to say so! Multiculturalism is a disaster. Almost everyone acknowledges this today, but few dare say why. Let me tell you why: Multiculturalism made us tolerate the intolerant, and now intolerance is annihilating tolerance. We should, in the name of tolerance, claim the right not to tolerate the intolerant. Let us no longer be afraid and politically correct, let us be brave and bold. Let us tell the truth about islam. Before I continue I want to make clear that I do not have a problem with people. I always make a distinction between the people and the ideology, between Muslims and islam. Indeed, I have no problems with Muslims, but I do have a problem with the totalitarian Islamic ideology of hate and violence. The fact that there are many so-called moderate Muslims, does not imply that there exists a moderate islam. A moderate islam doen not exist and will never exist. And because there is no such thing as a moderate islam, the islamization of our free Western societies is an enormous danger. Only two weeks ago, the British press revealed how the so-called “London Taliban” is threatening to kill women who do not wear veils in the London borough of Tower Hamlets. In some neighbourhoods Islamic regulations are already being enforced, also on non-Muslims. Women’s rights are being trampled. We are confronted with headscarves and burqa’s, polygamy, female genital mutilation, honor-killings where men murder their wives, daughters or sisters because they do not behave in accordance with Islamic rules. Polls show that the influence of those Muslims who live according to islam’s aggressive requirements is growing, especially among young people. Among 15-year-old German Muslims, 40 percent consider islam more important than democracy. Among Muslim university students in Britain, 40 percent support sharia. One in three of those students considers it legitimate to kill in the name of islam. Christians are asked to follow the example of Jesus. Muslims are ordered to follow the example of Muhammad. That is why islam is dangerous. While Christianity preaches love, islam preached hatred and practizes violence. Hatred and violence for everyone who is not a Muslim. Muhammad personally participated in the ethnic cleansing of Medina, where half the population once was Jewish. Muhammad helped to chop off their heads. On his deathbed, he ordered his followers to cleanse Arabia of all Jews and Christians. To this very day, Christian symbols are prohibited in Saudi-Arabia. If you wear a cross in Saudi Arabia, they sent you to jail. And now, Europe is beginning to look like Arabia. Just today, a poll revealed that in Brussels, the capital of the European Union, half the islamic youths are anti-semitic. It is dangerous for Jews to walk the streets in Brussels. If you wear a cross or a kippah in certain urban areas in Europe today, you risk being beaten up. In the capital of my own country, Amsterdam, a tram driver was forced to remove his crucifix from sight, while his Muslim colleagues are allowed to wear the veil. In June 2008, the Christian church authorities in the Danish town of Arhus decided to pay so-called “protection money” to islamic so-called “security guards” who assure that church goers are not harassed by islamic youths. On March 31st, 2010, Muslims entered the Roman Catholic cathedral of Cordoba, Spain, and attacked the guards with knives. They claimed the cathedral was theirs. Last month, the bishops of Sweden sent out a letter to priests advising them to avoid converting asylum seekers from islamic countries to Christianity, because the converts would risk losing their lives. In the Netherlands, the city authorities in Amsterdam register polygamous marriages. The authorities in Rotterdam serve only halal meals in municipal cafeterias. Theaters provide separate seats for women who are not allowed to sit next to men. Municipal swimming pools have separate swimming hours for men and women, Muslim lawyers do not have to stand when the judges enter court rooms. Meanwhile Jews are no longer safe on our streets. In Amsterdam, the city of Anne Frank, Jews are again being harassed in the streets. Even political leaders acknowledged that life has become unsafe for Jews in Holland. Do you know what they said? They advised Jews to emigrate. Jews are already running for Israel. But I say: Jews must not leave, violent Muslims must leave! What is needed, my friends, is a spirit of resistance. I repeat: What we need is a spirit of resistance. Why? Because resistance to evil is our moral duty. This resistance begins with expressing our solidarity to Christians, Jews, indeed, to all people worldwide, who are the victims of islam. There are millions of them. We can see what islam has in store for us if we watch the fate of the Christians in the islamic world, such as the Copts in Egypt, the Maronites in Lebanon, the Assyrians in Iraq, and Christians elsewhere. Almost every day, churches are arsoned and Christians are assassinated in islamic countries. In a report on the persecution of Christians in the world, Archbishop Twal of Jerusalem, wrote recently– I quote: “In the Middle East to be Christian means accepting that you must make a great sacrifice. All too often and in many places, Christians suffer various threats. On some occasions, their homes and churches are burnt, and people are killed. How many atrocities must we endure before somebody somewhere comes to our aid?” – end of quote. Indeed, how many atrocities before we come to their aid? Rivers of tears are flowing from the Middle East, where there is only one safe haven for Christians. You know where that is. The only place in the Middle East where Christians are safe is Israel. That is why Israel deserves our support. Israel is a safe haven for everyone, whatever their belief and opinions. Israel is a beacon of light in a region of total darkness. Israel is fighting our fight. The jihad against Israel is a jihad against all of us. If Israel falls, we, too, will feel the consequences. If Jerusalem falls, Athens, Rome, Amsterdam and Nashville will fall. Therefore, we all are Israel. We should always support Israel! Today, we are confronted with political unrest in the Arab countries. The Arab peoples long for freedom. However, the ideology and culture of islam is so deeply entrenched in these countries that real freedom is simply impossible as long as islam remains dominant. A recent poll in post-revolution Egypt found that 85 percent of Egyptians are convinced that islam’s influence on politics is good, 82 percent believe that adulterers should be stoned, 84 percent want the death penalty for apostates. The press refers to the events in the Arab world today as the Arab spring. I call it the Arab winter. Islam and freedom, islam and democracy are not compatible. The death of Osama bin Laden last week was a victory for the free world, but we will be confronted with Islamic terrorism as long as islam exists, because islam’s founder Muhammad himself was a terrorist, worse than Bin Laden. And here is another truth: The rise of islam means the rise of sharia law in our judicial systems. In Europe we already have sharia wills, sharia schools, sharia banks. Britain even has sharia courts. In my own country, the Netherlands, sharia is being applied by the courts in cases relating to divorce, child custody, inheritance, and property ownership. Women are always the victims of this because sharia discriminates women. This is a disgrace. This is not the way we should treat women. My friends, I told you that we have just remembered Liberation Day to commemorate the young Americans and all the heroes who offered their lives to free the Netherlands from nazi tyranny. It would be an insult to them if we Europeans would give up that precious freedom for another totalitarian ideology called Islam. That is the goal for which my party and I work day after day. And we are having success. In the Netherlands, we are successfully starting to roll back islam. The current Dutch government is a minority government which can only survive with the backing of my party, the Party for Freedom. We have 24 seats of the 150 seats in parliament and we support the government, in return for measures to prohibit certain aspects of sharia law. We have achieved that the Netherlands will soon ban the burka and the niqaab. We will also restrict immigration from non-Western countries by up to 50% in the next four years. We are not going to allow islam to steal our country from us. It was the land of our fathers, it is our land now, our values are based on Christianity, Judaism and Humanism and we will pass this on to our children with all the freedoms that the previous generations have fought for. Let those who want to rob us from our freedoms, stay in their own countries. We do not need them. If you want to wear a burqa, stay in Saudi-Arabia. If you want four wives, stay in Iran. If you want to live in a country where the islamic ideology is dominant, stay in Pakistan, if you don’t want to assimilate in our society, stay in Somalia. But don’t come over here. We are also going to strip criminals who have a double nationality – for instance Dutch and Moroccan, and who repeatedly commit serious crimes, of their Dutch nationality. We will send them packing, back to their homeland. My friends, what the Party for Freedom has achieved, shows that it can be done. We can fight the islamization of our societies. Dear friends, here is my warning. Make no mistake: Islam is also coming for America. In fact, it is already here. America is facing a stealth jihad, the islamic attempt to introduce sharia law bit by bit. Last March, a judge in Tampa, Florida, ruled that a lawsuit against a mosque and involving the control of 2.4 million dollars, should proceed under Islamic law. My friends, be aware that this is only the beginning. This is also how it started in Europe. If things continue like this, you will soon have the same problems as we are currently facing. Leaders who talk about immigration without mentioning islam are blind. They ignore the most important problem Europe and America are facing. I have a message for them: it’s islam stupid! My friends, fortunately, not all politicians are irresponsible. Here, in Tennessee, brave politicians want to pass legislation which gives the state the power to declare organisations as terrorist groups and allowing material supporters of terrorism to be prosecuted. I applaud them for that. They are true heroes. Yesterday and today, I met some of those brave legislators. They told me that Tennessee in particular is a target of islam. Help them win their battle. They need your support. While Tennessee is in the frontline, similar legislative initiatives are also being taken in the states of Oklahoma, Wyoming, South Carolina, Texas, Florida, Missouri, Arizona, Indiana. It is encouraging to see that so many politicians are willing to resist islam. This gives us hope and courage. I am not a pessimist. We can still turn the tide – even in Europe – if we act today. There are five things which we must do. First, we must defend freedom of speech. Freedom is the source of human creativity and development. People and nations wither away without the freedom to question what is presented to them as the truth. Without freedom of speech we risk becoming slaves. Frederick Douglass, the 19th century black American politician, the son of a slave, said – I quote – “To suppress free speech is a double wrong. It violates the rights of the hearer as well as those of the speaker.” I have already told you about my court case. This legal charade will not, however, prevent me from saying the truth. Never. I will speak out, even if they drag me before 500 courts and threaten to jail me for a thousand years. The fact that we are being treated as criminals for telling the truth must not deter us. We are doomed if we remain silent or let ourselves be silenced. Let us not forget, this is our first and most important obligation: defend the right to speak the truth. Second, we must end cultural relativism and political correctness. We must repeat it over and over again, especially to our children: Our Western culture based on Christianity and Judaism is superior to the islamic culture. Our laws are superior to sharia. Our judeo-christian values are better than islam’s totalitarian rules. And because they are superior and better, we must defend them. We must fight for our own identity, or else we will lose it. We need to be warriors for the good, because the good is worth fighting for. Neutrality in the face of evil is evil. Third, we must stop the islamization of our countries. More islam means less freedom. There is enough islam in the West already. We must stop immigration from non-Western countries, which are mostly islamic countries. We must expel criminal immigrants. We must forbid the construction of new hate palaces called mosques. We must also close down all islamic schools because educating children in a spirit of hate is one of the worst things imaginable. We must introduce anti-sharia legislation everywhere in the free world. Enough is enough. Fourth, we must take pride in our nations again. We must cherish and preserve the culture and identity of our country. Preserving our own culture and identity is the best antidote against islamization. And fifth, last but certainly not least, we must elect wise and courageous leaders who are brave enough to address the problems which are facing us, including the threat of islam. Politicians who have the courage to speak the truth about islam. Politicians who dare to denounce the devastating results of the multicultural society. Politicians who – without political correctness – say: enough is enough. You and I, Americans and Europeans, we belong to a common Western culture. We share the ideas and ideals of our common Judeo-Christian heritage. In order to pass this heritage on to our children and grandchildren, we must stand together, side by side, in our struggle against Islamic barbarism. That, my friends, is why I am here. I am here to forge an alliance. Our international freedom alliance. We must stand together for the Judeo-Christian West. We will not allow islam to overrun Israel and Europe, the cradle of the judeo-Christian civilization. My friends, we will stand together. We will stand firm. We will not submit. Never. Not in Israel, not in Europe, not in America. Nowhere. We will survive. We will stop islam. We will defend our freedoms. We will remain free. This is the text of a speech by Geert Wilders in the Cornerstone Church in Nashville, 12 May 2011 Submitted by graecus on Fri, 2011-06-17 19:57. Mr.Wilders is of course quite correct to differentiate bewteen the undesirables, what I call the sharia freaks, and the ordinary, normal Muslim folk. Expats in Indonesia live with and work with such Muslims every day, and they are perfectly agreeable colleagues and neighbours. However, that may be changing. The schools are producing, thanks to ignorant and bigoted religious education, a new breed of Indonesians. Amazingly, Western funds go to the pondok pesantren, Islamic boarding schools, which are infamous for sectarian malice. No effective checks are made to sanitise their curricula. The results? A majority of Indonesians aged 15 -25 now see themselves as Muslim First, Indonesian Second. Have a look at our expat blog.  Submitted by Yohanan on Mon, 2011-05-16 01:44. Just know you are not alone in your thoughts or beliefs Geert. Have faith in the quiet awakening of non-politically correct highly informed individuals who are well aware of Islam's agenda, the current political resistance to our histories, liberties, and choices, and even more aware of what the Koran tells those ignorant fools who choose the path of death. The trouble is, we are all living in a time where the arrogant few inside the oligarchy think they are smart enough to fool the greater masses by ignoring the wishes of those who chose them for their office. This situation appears to have happened while the greater world was too self-absorbed to care about what has been happening while they were dazzled with stupid gadgets and meaningless pursuits. Only a few pay heed to the truth that foretold the end from the beginning, and is the only true authority in all of history. But, as history also proves, only a select few of quality individuals makes the difference in the end. The world's current situation could easily be classified as a disease, and we know what path a disease must take when the majority are ignorant. Submitted by Frank Lee on Mon, 2011-05-16 00:41. I was greatly moved by the transcipt of Mr. Wilders's speech, but the speech was handicapped from the outset by a whopper of a lie: Mr. Wilder claims that the Dutch are ""immensely grateful"" to the American soldiers who died liberating the Netherlands from Nazi occupation, and that the Dutch will never forget their debt to America. I am American myself, and I have never witnessed a nano-second of sincere gratitude from the Dutch or any other Europeans. Submitted by debendevan on Fri, 2011-05-13 22:22. Dear Mr. Wilders, The message you are sharing is an important one. Although I am currently in Tennessee on business our national press makes no mention of your arrival or presence. I would encourage you to spend more time here; speak to other corners of this country; and spread the word to not only the more than 5 million Dutch-Americans but also to the millions more of the rest of the US. Good luck with your journey and I look forward to you speaking in Chicago. Best wishes, de bende van... Submitted by mpresley on Fri, 2011-05-13 18:20. Mr. Wilders should be commended for bringing the situation more directly to our attention. At the same time, in spite of his courage, and in spite of his generally positive influence, his thinking is rather disjointed in certain essential areas. This may be because he is mostly speaking to a larger group, and speaking within an open forum where loose speech is often a requirement, especially given the nature of a more general audience. There is much that could be said, however I offer only a few examples. [Americans] are still allowed to tell the truth. This must be qualified, and depends upon what truth will be told. There are many facts that, when openly stated, are sufficient to get one fired from employment, or otherwise socially ostracized. But, technically, Wilders is more correct than not. Government censorship is not at the level of Europe, or Canada. Cultural relativism advocates that all cultures are equal. Without discussing the nonsensical epistemological ground of the idea of cultural equality, it is enough to modify this statement in order to reflect its more usual practical sentiment: that is, all cultures are worthy of respect and tolerance except Western culture, which is viewed as intrinsically defective due to the sins of racism, sexism, homosexualism, and the list goes on. Islam is spreading like wildfire because the Koran explicitly tells Muslims that they are “the best of peoples ever raised up for mankind” and that non-Muslims are “the worst of creatures.” I do not think this is a very good explanation, and one must not confuse cause with effect. I suspect that we could find other, more valid reasons for the embrace of the religion. It would be better to state: Islam is spreading, and as a result it teaches contempt for non-Muslims, etc. Our Judeo-Christian Western culture is far better and far superior to the islamic culture. It would be better, or at least more accurate, to state that Christianity helped produce (or at the very least was coeval with) high civilization, Nevertheless, I think use of the word “produced” is accurate, if we mean by it to imply that Christianity built upon a foundation of pre-existing Greek philosophy and Roman law. The contributions of Jews were never very important within the overall context of the development of Western civilization—at least from an historical perspective, in spite of later substantial contributions in the realm of science and technology, along with 19th and 20th century social philosophy (although the latter is often not commonly viewed as a positive). Today, however, both Christians and Jews are quite active in dispossessing their received culture, usually, for Christians, in the name of a universalist spiritual equality and a drive to transform Christ into some kind of social reformer. Contrariwise, the Jewish religion has been more exclusionary, and therefore one may rightly wonder how it is that so many Jewish intellectuals and religious leaders welcome multi-culturalism (typically in all places except Israel). Multiculturalism made us tolerate the intolerant, and now intolerance is annihilating tolerance. No. It was individuals who, through groupthink and political intimidation, along with religious and social agreement, fostered a totalitarian way of irrational thinking. I always make a distinction between the people and the ideology, between Muslims and islam. This is really an unproductive disassociation. But it is one that is heard often. The Arab peoples long for freedom. What evidence is there of this? It seems more a soundbite than anything else. And it is contradicted by what follows. No, I believe that for the most part Arabs want a powerful Islamic regime. I wish Mr. Wilders well, but am not happy for his prospects.

"The head of the International Monetary Fund, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, has been charged by New York police over an alleged sex attack on a hotel maid. Mr Strauss-Kahn, 62, was taken off an Air France plane at JFK airport just minutes before it left for Paris. Police say the maid has now formally identified him in a line-up. He faces three charges which he denies. The married former French finance minister is also considered a possible Socialist candidate for the presidency. The 's Hugh Schofield, in Paris, says Mr Strauss-Kahn has been riding high in the polls and was seen as having a genuine chance of beating President Nicolas Sarkozy. Martine Aubry, leader of France's Socialist Party, described news of his arrest as a ""thunderbolt"" which left her ""astounded"". Mr Strauss-Kahn is expected to appear before a New York state court before 0100 local time on Monday (0500 GMT), despite reports of a delay as police apply for search warrants for further DNA evidence. His lawyer, William Taylor, told Agence France-Presse news agency: ""We saw him, he's doing OK. And we'll be in court with him later in the afternoon."" Mr Strauss-Kahn had been scheduled to meet German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Sunday, but that meeting has now been cancelled, reports say. On Monday he had planned to attend a meeting of European Union finance ministers in Brussels on Monday to discuss the bailouts of Portugal and Greece. Correspondents say his detention is likely to complicate ongoing efforts to stabilise the finances of struggling eurozone member states. The Euro fell half a cent to $1.4063 when Asian markets opened on Monday - a six-week low against the dollar - reflecting concerns about the impact the arrest could have on the bailout talks. In a brief statement posted online on Sunday, an IMF spokeswoman acknowledged Mr Strauss-Kahn's arrest and said the organisation would not comment on the case. ""The IMF remains fully functioning and operational,"" she added. John Lipsky will act as IMF managing director in Mr Strauss-Kahn's absence. Dominique Strauss-Kahn's arrest unfolded in dramatic fashion as he was poised to fly to Europe. A spokesman for New York's Port Authority said they detained Mr Strauss-Kahn at JFK airport at the request of the New York Police Department (NYPD). NYPD spokesman Paul Browne said Mr Strauss-Kahn had been charged with a criminal sexual act, attempted rape and unlawful imprisonment relating to an incident involving a 32-year-old woman. Mr Browne said the allegations had been made by a 32-year-old woman who worked at the hotel, which has been identified as the Sofitel near Times Square. His accommodation there was described by the New York Times as a luxury suite costing $3,000 per night (Â£1,900). ""We received a call that a chambermaid in a hotel in midtown Manhattan had been sexually assaulted by the occupant of a luxury suite at that hotel, and that that individual had fled,"" Mr Browne told the . ""The maid described being forcibly attacked, locked in the room and sexually assaulted,"" he said. Speaking to Reuters, Mr Browne gave more details on the allegations against Mr Strauss-Kahn. ""She told detectives he came out of the bathroom naked, ran down a hallway to the [suite] foyer where she was, pulled her into a bedroom and began to sexually assault her, according to her account."" ""She pulled away from him and he dragged her down a hallway into the bathroom where he engaged in a criminal sexual act, according to her account to detectives. He tried to lock her into the hotel room."" Mr Strauss-Kahn then made his way to the airport but left his mobile phone and other items behind, Mr Brown said. ""It looked like he got out of there in a hurry."" By the time police established that the occupant of the room was Mr Strauss-Kahn, the IMF chief was on board an Air France plane at John F Kennedy airport, about to depart for Paris. ""Our detectives requested of the airport authorities that they stop the plane from leaving, went to the airport and took him into custody,"" Mr Browne said. ""If our officers had been 10 minutes later he would have been in the air and on their way to France."" The woman has been treated at hospital for minor injuries, said Mr Browne. Mr Strauss-Kahn ran for the French Socialist Party's presidential candidacy in 2006 but lost to Segolene Royal. He was appointed managing director of the IMF the following year. Mr Strauss-Kahn has won praise for his stewardship of the IMF, which he has guided through difficult times including the recent world financial crisis. But in 2008 he was investigated by the IMF board over his relationship with a female member of his staff. The board ruled his actions ""reflected a serious error of judgment"" but that the relationship had been consensual. He apologised to IMF staff and his wife, French TV personality Anne Sinclair. Mr Strauss-Kahn has not yet announced whether he intends to run in the 2012 French presidential elections, but had widely been expected to do so.

"Of the 204 new Obamacare waivers President Barack Obama’s administration approved in April, 38 are for fancy eateries, hip nightclubs and decadent hotels in House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi’s Northern California district. That’s in addition to the 27 new waivers for health care or drug companies and the 31 new union waivers Obama’s Department of Health and Human Services approved. Pelosi’s district secured almost 20 percent of the latest issuance of waivers nationwide, and the companies that won them didn’t have much in common with companies throughout the rest of the country that have received Obamacare waivers. Other common waiver recipients were labor union chapters, large corporations, financial firms and local governments. But Pelosi’s district’s waivers are the first major examples of luxurious, gourmet restaurants and hotels getting a year-long pass from Obamacare. For instance, Boboquivari’s restaurant in Pelosi’s district in San Francisco got a waiver from Obamacare. Boboquivari’s advertises $59 porterhouse steaks, $39 filet mignons and $35 crab dinners. Then, there’s Café des Amis, which describes its eating experience as “a timeless Parisian style brasserie” which is “located on one of San Francisco’s premier shopping and strolling boulevards, Union Street,” according to the restaurant’s Web site. “Bacchus Management Group, in partnership with Perry Butler, is bringing you that same warm, inviting feeling, with a distinctive San Francisco spin,” the Web site reads. Somehow, though, the San Francisco upper class eatery earned itself a waiver from Obamacare because it apparently cost them too much to meet the law’s first year requirements. The reason the Obama administration says it has given out waivers is to exempt certain companies or policyholders from “annual limit requirements.” The applications for the waivers are “reviewed on a case by case basis by department officials who look at a series of factors including whether or not a premium increase is large or if a significant number of enrollees would lose access to their current plan because the coverage would not be offered in the absence of a waiver.” The waivers don’t allow a company to permanently refrain from implementing Obamacare’s stipulations, but companies can reapply for waivers annually through 2014. Café Mason, a diner near San Francisco’s Union Square, got a waiver too. When The Daily Caller asked the manager about the waiver and how the president’s new sweeping federal health care law was affecting his restaurant, he hung up the phone. The Franciscan Crab restaurant on Fisherman’s Wharf in San Francisco got a waiver. Its menu features entrees ranging from about $15 to $60. The Franciscan’s general manager didn’t return TheDC’s requests for comment. Four-star hotel Campton Place got one too, as did Hotel Nikko San Francisco, which describes itself as “four-diamond luxury in the heart of the city.” Tru Spa, which Allure Magazine rated the “best day spa in San Francisco,” received an Obamacare waiver as well. Before hanging up on TheDC, Tru Spa’s owner said new government health care regulations, both the federal-level Obamacare and new local laws in Northern California, have “devastated” the business. “It’s been bad for us,” he said, without divulging his name, referring to the new health care restrictions. But, the spa owner wouldn’t talk about it or the reason his company sought a waiver. He hung up after saying, “I’ve got clients on the other line, good-bye.” San Francisco Honda, which has two of its three locations in Pelosi’s district, and San Francisco’s Royal Motors Group both got waivers too. Neither called TheDC back. Blue & Gold Fleet, which describes itself as “the Bay Area’s premier provider of Bay Cruise, Ferry Service and Motorcoach Tours,” got an Obamacare waiver approved in April. The tour service company didn’t return TheDC’s requests for comment. Nightclub Infusion Lounge got an Obamacare waiver approved in April too. Infusion Lounge calls itself a “sophisticated nightlife destination” with “Asian inspired sub-rosa lounge, fashioned by Hong Kong’s hottest designer, Kinney Chan,” which makes for a “true ultra lounge catering to both dancing hipsters and young professionals looking to relax in style.” Infusion Lounge’s owners didn’t return TheDC’s requests for comment either. Simco Restaurants and several other affiliated chains based in the area got waivers for their businesses as well. For example, Gordon Yoshida, the manager of memorabilia store Only in San Francisco, told TheDC that Sandra Fletcher of Simco walked him through the process of getting an Obamacare waiver. Fletcher did not return TheDC’s requests for comment. Pelosi’s office did not respond to TheDC’s requests for comment either.

"“These are the kind of people running the IMF, and we want to turn the world’s finances and the control of the money supply (over) to them?” – Representative Ron Paul describes soon-to-be-former IMF Chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn(HT: Takimag.com) It is said that even the blind squirrel will occasionally get a nut. Under the right collection of screwed up and unusual conditions, The Mississippi River has been known to temporarily flow backwards in some places. Also, Congressman Ron Paul has his days when he is magnificently right. He is on the issue of DSK, but he doesn’t understand the extent to which he was right or even why? Rape-man DSK should be exposed to condign public ignominy. Not over Ron Paul’s quixotic views on money supply or currency management, but rather because he typifies modern world leadership. The type of guy who thinks that he totally should get to bone the cleaning lady if he drops $3K for a hotel room is precisely the sort of person who is running much of the modern world. There is only one antidote to this sort of Son of a NSFW, and that cure is a vigilant public. The elevation of people like DSK to positions of high responsibility not only justifies, but demands the continued existence of organizations like America’s Tea Parties. America is a society that once thrived as a result of checks and balances. Sir Isaac Newton would have loved the US Constitution. Every action seemed to have an equal and opposite reaction. For a long time, this frustrated the partisans and stymied the utopians. However, this also served the American People profoundly well. Yet, even the best engineering designs fail. Walter Russell Mead describes how an elite American Establishment has sought to circumvent this Yin and Yang of American Society and exert dominance without restraint. Mead’s description of the problem follows below. But the United States today — in both parties, in the corporate and business worlds, in academia and among the intelligentsia, in religion and in many other fields — does not have the strong and thoughtful leadership that we need. That is not what the elite thinks, by and large. To listen to many bien pensant American intellectuals and above-the-salt journalists, America faces a shocking problem today: the cluelessness, greed, arrogance and bigotry of the American public. (Ht: the American Interest.com) The sentiments described in the second paragraph above lead the elite to justify self-interested behavior. Once they get the elite position, they don’t think highly of the poor peasants who have to clean and vacuum the $3K hotel rooms. Thus, this elite feels justified in using their positions to fulfill selfish desires in oblivious neglect to the commonweal that they were elected to better and preserve. Peggy Noonan described this detestable tendency as “The Separate Peace.” She defines what this means exactly below. I have a nagging sense, and think I have accurately observed, that many of these people have made a separate peace. That they’re living their lives and taking their pleasures and pursuing their agendas; that they’re going forward each day with the knowledge, which they hold more securely and with greater reason than nonelites, that the wheels are off the trolley and the trolley’s off the tracks, and with a conviction, a certainty, that there is nothing they can do about it. I suspect that history, including great historical novelists of the future, will look back and see that many of our elites simply decided to enjoy their lives while they waited for the next chapter of trouble. And that they consciously, or unconsciously, took grim comfort in this thought: I got mine. Which is what the separate peace comes down to, “I got mine, you get yours.” (HT: PeggyNoonan.com) Only one antidote exists to such an elite “leadership.” They must be challenged. Ironically, it is Famous Black Nationalist, Malcolm X, who describes the role groups like The Tea Party must play in preventing this parlously corrupt, inbred and enstupidated elite from running amok. In his famous “Message to The Grass-Roots” Speech he described the level of dedication required to make Civil Rights for African Americans a national issue in the early 1960’s. We’re going to march on Washington, march on the Senate, march on the White House, march on the Congress, and tie it up, bring it to a halt; don’t let the government proceed. They even said they was going out to the airport and lay down on the runway and don’t let no airplanes land. (HT:sojust.net) Given the current failings of America’s air traffic control system, I wouldn’t recommend lying down on anybody’s runway. However, Malcolm X made a valid and intelligent intellectual point here. We get what we tolerate. Let the government jam Cap-and-Trade or the Individual Mandate down your throat, and you might as well add Tabasco Sauce, because you are going to eat it. The Tea Party checks our detestable leadership, since morality, like Elvis, has long since left the building. Ron Paul got one right when he questioned letting people like DSK handle our nation’s monetary future. However, he missed a vital opportunity to expand the rEVOLution without any loss of generality. Why should a jerk like DSK get to run much of anything, and who’s to stop that sort of iniquitous Cloaca Maximus from becoming just as powerful in the Good ‘Ol US of A? The Tea Party, that’s who! It still remains time to party like 1773. "
"You are now logged in. Forgot your password? Create new account Drug War Jacob Sullum | 3.2.2011 7:00 AM Last week Mitch Daniels, Indiana's governor, told The Daily Princetonian that ""justice was served"" when he was arrested for marijuana possession during his junior year at Princeton. But like many pot smokers who became politicians, Daniels, a potential contender for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, seems to have two standards of justice: one for him and one for anyone else who does what he did. Although Daniels was caught with enough marijuana to trigger a prison sentence, he got off with a $350 fine. Yet he has advocated ""jail time"" for ""casual users""—a stark illustration of the schizophrenic attitudes that help perpetuate drug policies widely recognized as unjust. According to the Princetonian, ""officers found enough marijuana in [Daniels'] room to fill two size 12 shoe boxes."" Under current New Jersey law, possessing more than 50 grams (about 1.8 ounces) of marijuana is a felony punishable by up to 18 months in prison. Given the amount of pot Daniels had, he easily could have been charged with intent to distribute, which under current law triggers a penalty of three to five years. At the time of Daniels' arrest in May 1970, New Jersey's marijuana penalties were even more severe. Six months after his arrest, the New Jersey Supreme Court decided a case involving an 18-year-old who received a sentence of two to three years in prison after police found a pot pipe and part of a joint in his house. Concluding that ""the sentence was entirely too harsh,"" the court ruled that ""a suspended sentence with an appropriate term of probation is sufficient penalty for a person who is convicted for the first time of possessing marihuana for his own use."" But given the legal situation prior to this ruling, Daniels was very lucky to escape with no more than a fine. This lenient treatment was possible because he did not plead guilty to marijuana possession—only to the lesser offense of ""maintaining a common nuisance."" In 1989, when he was president of the Hudson Institute, Daniels recounted his brush with the law in a Washington Post op-ed piece. Amazingly, he did so in support of harsher treatment for ""casual users,"" who he said were getting off too lightly. ""Absent a resumption of enforcement against the casual user,"" Daniels wrote, ""we will neither slash the demand that fuels the drug economy nor will we demonstrate to ourselves the seriousness of purpose inherent to any real 'war.'"" He said ""the threshold test of seriousness on the drug issue"" is a willingness to endorse ""user sanctions,"" including ""jail time."" A few years after Daniels called for a crackdown on drug users, the number of marijuana arrests in the U.S. began a steady climb, peaking at 873,000 in 2007, up from 327,000 in 1990. In 2009 there were 858,000 marijuana arrests, of which 87 percent were for possession. The increase in pot busts has been especially dramatic in New York City under Mayor Michael Bloomberg. This is what Bloomberg said in 2001, shortly before he announced his candidacy for mayor, when a reporter asked him whether he had smoked marijuana: ""You bet I did, and I enjoyed it."" Bloomberg's honesty was refreshing compared to the evasiveness of Bill Clinton, who said he'd tried pot without inhaling, and George W. Bush, who refused to address the subject. But whatever points Bloomberg earned for candor he lost for the blatant hypocrisy of his continuing anti-pot campaign. Likewise Barack Obama, another self-identified former pot smoker who stopped supporting marijuana decriminalization when he ran for president and now literally laughs at the idea. To his credit, Daniels today advocates criminal justice reform, including a reconsideration of sentences for nonviolent drug offenders. But if he really believes a fine is the appropriate penalty for someone caught with two shoeboxes of marijuana, he should at least support decriminalizing possession and treating it as a citable offense. Currently in Indiana, the amount of pot Daniels had triggers a sentence of six months to three years. Jacob Sullum is a senior editor at  and a nationally syndicated columnist. © "
"Santorum (left) says McCain 'doesn't understand how enhanced interrogation works.' | AP Photos By JUANA SUMMERS 05/17/2011 02:24 PM EDT Updated 05/18/2011 10:56 AM EDT Rick Santorum said Tuesday that Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who was tortured as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, ""doesn't understand how enhanced interrogation works."" Speaking on Hugh Hewitt’s radio show, Santorum, the presidential hopeful and former Pennsylvania senator, says McCain is misguided in his stance against the enhanced interrogation techniques sanctioned during the Bush administration but discontinued by Obama's White House, which has labeled them torture. “Everything I’ve read shows that we would not have gotten this information as to who this man was if it had not been gotten information from people who were subject to enhanced interrogation,” Santorum said, referring to the courier that led Americans to Osama bin Laden. “And so this idea that we didn’t ask that question while Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was being waterboarded, he doesn’t understand how enhanced interrogation works. I mean, you break somebody, and after they’re broken, they become cooperative.” With the torture debate reignited by bin Laden's death, McCain has argued that enhanced interrogation did not lead the United States to the terror leader, and that his death should not be used to justify past use of techniques like waterboarding. Last week, McCain took to the Washington Post’s op-ed page, saying that techniques like waterboarding have no place in American interrogation policies. In a statement to  after publication of this article, Santorum emphasized said his comments shouldn't be taken as an insult to McCain's service. “I disagree with Senator McCain’s view that the enhanced interrogation techniques used on a select few high-value terrorist detainees were unsuccessful nor do I believe they amounted to torture,"" he said. ""For anyone to infer my disagreement with Senator McCain’s policy position lessens my respect for his service to our country and all he had to endure is outrageous and unfortunate.” Missing out on the latest scoops?

"Emails between Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan and members of the Obama Administration reveal she was more involved with President Obama’s health-care law than was disclosed previously. The documents likely will lead to a revival of questions about whether the Kagan should recuse herself from future cases. Specifically, the documents show that Kagan was involved with crafting the legal defense of the Affordable Care Act in her role as solicitor general, before her appointment to the bench. The Media Research Center and Judicial Watch obtained the documents through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit that was filed in February 2011. In an email dated Jan. 8, 2010, then-Deputy Solicitor General Neal Katyal sent an email to Senior Counsel Brian Hauck and Deputy Attorney General Thomas Perrelli that indicates Kagan played a key role in coming up with a legal defense. “Brian, Elena would definitely like OSG [Office of Solicitor General] to be involved in this set of issues … we will bring Elena as needed.” In an email on March 21, 2010, Katyal urged Kagan to attend a health-care litigation meeting on defending the law. “I think you should go, no?” wrote Katyal. “I will, regardless, but feel like this is litigation of singular importance.” The documents also show that once Kagan was nominated to the Supreme Court, she and Katyal immediately switched course to distance her from discussions about the legislation. On May 17, 2010, for example, Tracy Schmaler, a Department of Justice spokesperson wrote to Katyal, “Has Elena been involved in any of that to the extent SG office was consulted … ?” “No, she has never been involved in any of it. I’ve run it for the office, and have never discussed the issues with her one bit,” was Katyal’s response. He then forwarded the correspondence to Kagan, saying “This is what I told Tracy about Health Care.” Kagan’s response: “This needs to be coordinated. Tracy you should not say anything about this before talking to me.” Other email chains between Kagan, White House lawyers and Vice President Joe Biden’s then-Chief of Staff Ronald Klain show a coordinated effort on how to respond to questions about the health-care law that may have arisen in the confirmation hearings. According to Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton, the Department of Justice is conducting an ongoing investigation that could uncover more documents concerning Kagan’s involvement in the health-care defense. “I was surprised by these documents considering her testimony,” Fitton told The Daily Caller. “And I suspect some senators on the Judiciary Committee ought to be surprised.” “It certainly doesn’t look good,” he added. “The Obama administration appointed Kagan. It was well known this appointment was key in terms of providing a defense of the health-care law.” The Daily Caller | 1775 Eye Street NW | Suite 1150-290 | Washington, DC 20006"
"Suppose the true source of income was a gigantic pile of money meant to be shared equally amongst Americans. The reason some people have more money than others is because they got to the pile first and greedily took an unfair share. That being the case, justice requires that the rich give something back, and if they won't do so voluntarily, Congress should confiscate their ill-gotten gains and return them to their rightful owners. A competing liberal implied assumption about the sources of income is that income is distributed, as in distribution of income. There might be a dealer of dollars. The reason why some people have more dollars than others is because the dollar dealer is a racist, a sexist, a multinationalist or a conservative. The only right thing to do, for those to whom the dollar dealer unfairly dealt too many dollars, is to give back their ill-gotten gains. If they refuse to do so, then it's the job of Congress to use their agents at the IRS to confiscate their ill-gotten gains and return them to their rightful owners. In a word, there must be a re-dealing of the dollars or what some people call income redistribution. The sane among us recognize that in a free society, income is neither taken nor distributed; for the most part, it is earned. Income is earned by pleasing one's fellow man. The greater one's ability to please his fellow man, the greater is his claim on what his fellow man produces. Those claims are represented by the number of dollars received from his fellow man. Say I mow your lawn. For doing so, you pay me $20. I go to my grocer and demand, ""Give me 2 pounds of steak and a six-pack of beer that my fellow man produced."" In effect, the grocer asks, ""Williams, you're asking your fellow man to serve you. Did you serve him?"" I reply, ""Yes."" The grocer says, ""Prove it."" That's when I pull out the $20 I earned from serving my fellow man. We can think of that $20 as ""certificates of performance."" They stand as proof that I served my fellow man. It would be no different if I were an orthopedic doctor, with a large clientele, earning $500,000 per year by serving my fellow man. By the way, having mowed my fellow man's lawn or set his fractured fibula, what else do I owe him or anyone else? What's the case for being forced to give anything back? If one wishes to be charitable, that's an entirely different matter. Contrast the morality of having to serve one's fellow man in order to have a claim on what he produces with congressional handouts. In effect, Congress says, ""You don't have to serve your fellow man in order to have a claim on what he produces. We'll take what he produces and give it to you. Just vote for me."" Who should give back? Sam Walton founded Wal-Mart, Bill Gates founded Microsoft, Steve Jobs founded Apple Computer. Which one of these billionaires acquired their wealth by coercing us to purchase their product? Which has taken the property of anyone? Each of these examples, and thousands more, is a person who served his fellow men by producing products and services that made life easier. What else do they owe? They've already given. If anyone is obliged to give something back, they are the thieves and recipients of legalized theft, namely people who've used Congress, including America's corporate welfare queens, to live at the expense of others. When a nation vilifies the productive and makes mascots of the unproductive, it doesn't bode well for its future. .com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis.

"A very large proportion of recent university graduates have soured on President Barack Obama, and many will vote GOP or stay at home in the 2012 election, according to two new surveys of younger voters. “These rock-solid Obama constituents are free-agents,” said Kellyanne Conway, president of The Polling Company, based in Washington, D.C. She recently completed a large survey of college grads, and “they’re shopping around, considering their options, [and] a fair number will stay at home and sit it out,” she said. The scope of this disengagement from Obama is suggested by an informal survey of 500 post-grads by Joe Maddalone, founder of Maddalone Global Strategies. Of his sample, 93 percent are aged between 22 and 28, 67 percent are male and 83 percent voted for Obama in 2008. But only 27 percent are committed to voting for Obama again, and 80 percent said they would consider voting for a Republican, said New York-based Maddalone. That’s a drop of almost 60 points in support for Obama among this influential class of younger post-grad voters, who Maddalone recruited at conferences held at New York University and Thomson-Reuters’ New York headquarters. The bad news for Obama was underlined May 19 with a report by a job-firm Adecco that roughly 60 percent of recent college-grads have not been able to find a full-time job in their preferred area. One-in-five graduates have taken jobs far from their training, one-in-six are dependent on their parents, and one-in-four say they’re in debt, according to the firm’s data. (Read: AARP Latest to Receive Obamacare Break…) Overall, roughly one-third of young voters have some college education, and one-half have college degrees, said Conway. Many are underemployed or unemployed, they’re worried about their debts and economic trends, and they’re worried about the value of their educations, she said. In 2012, she said, “I suspect a fair number will return to Obama, but maybe not enough, and not in the [swing] states where he needs them,” she said. Those states include Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, New Hampshire, Indiana, Virginia and Iowa, she said. All were won by Obama in 2008, and all were lost in state-wide elections to GOP candidates in 2010, she said. The GOP is making some progress towards earning their votes, Maddalone said. For example, 38 percent of his respondents said the GOP is “doing a good job addressing and engaging with young professionals,” and 58 percent said they would consider voting for the GOP “if you felt that Republicans were doing a good job addressing and engaging with young professionals.” Only one-in-six of his respondents voted for the GOP presidential candidate in 2008, and 80 percent of those said they would vote GOP again, said Maddalone. (Read: Palin on 2012: ‘I Do Have the Fire in my Belly’…) “People have had time to reflect on how they voted in 2008, and now they’re thinking about whether they have a job or like their job,” said Maddalone. As their trust in the federal government shrinks, they’re becoming more self-reliant, as their attitude shifts from “‘yes, we can,’ to ‘yes, I can,’” he said. This shift, he said, “is not really being discussed.” Still, there’s a wide gap in priorities between the millions of crucial swing-voters in swing-states — Ohio, Florida, Virginia, for example — and Maddalone’s group of mostly male, urban, and upwardly-mobile professionals. Many of those swing voters have already pulled the lever for GOP candidates in 2010, but 59 percent of Maddalone’s respondents said the GOP is still not “doing a good job addressing and engaging with young professionals.” This gap isn’t merely created by the parties’ economic platforms. One in six of the respondents said would not vote GOP even if the GOP was “doing a good job addressing and engaging with young professionals.” Some of those gaps were evident in a recent survey by California-based RK Research. One thousand college students ranked education, economic and health care as their top three issues, but credited top marks to the GOP for its stance on military issues and a “business-friendly environment.” The students ranked the GOP low on environmental, immigration and gay-rights issues, but they also ranked those last two issues as a low priority.

"by Brett Stevens on May 20, 2011 Prole drift is the universal tendency of human beings to please their social group by being inclusive. Who needs including? Those who did not distinguish themselves. Thus prole drift is always a drift downward toward the lowest: lowest intelligence, moral character, health, wealth, political/social power and physical beauty. This means that society changes from wanting to rise above the rest to settling down into what the lowest among them desire. Since intelligence and moral character are on that list of lower traits, you can tell this means something dumber, more venal, more permissive and less disciplined. In other words, a reversal of evolution and failure to ascend. For example, let’s look at the blue jean — a fashion statement from 1960s through 1990s, now more like a people’s uniform: â€˜Denimâ€™ is probably a corruption of the French serge de NÃ®mes, a twill-weave fabric made in NÃ®mes during the 17th century. Another European fabric â€“ a â€˜fustianâ€™ made from a cotton, linen and/or wool blend â€“ was known as â€˜jeanâ€™ after the sailors of Genoa, Italy, who wore it. By the 18th century, as slave labour, trade and cotton plantations developed, jean cloth was being made entirely of cotton and was valued for its durability. Indigo blue, extracted from plants in the Americas and India, became a familiar colour for workwear. Immigrant weavers from Yorkshire, England, produced heavy cotton fustians â€“ cotton-twill jeans â€“ from a cloth mill in Massachusetts as early as 1638. In 1789 George Washington toured a mill in Massachusetts that was weaving both denim and jean. By 1849 a New York manufacturer was advertising topcoats, vests and short jackets in blue jean. Mechanics and painters were wearing overalls made of blue denim; others wore more tailored trousers made of jean. – The New Internationalist What happened to that clothing of the laborer in the United States? The worker took it to a gold rush: 1873: Blue jeans assume their distinctive form when a patent is issued for the rivet process used to strengthen the pockets on what were then called â€œwaist overalls.â€ Jacob Youphes, a Latvian immigrant who changed his name to Jacob Davis (.pdf) after coming to the United States in 1854, was working as a tailor in Reno, Nevada, when he hit on the idea of using copper rivets to reinforce denim working pants (.pdf). Since he obtained his denim from Levi Strauss & Co. in San Francisco, Davis approached Strauss with an offer to file for a joint patent. Strauss â€” knowing a good thing when he saw it â€” accepted, and the modern â€œblue jeanâ€ was born. – Wired Nowadays, jeans are not a status symbol but a humility symbol. In the 1980s, designer jeans proliferated, and were the most sought Western item in closed societies like Soviet Russia. When Communism fell, the price of an AK-47 or Soviet military uniform was a pair of American jeans. At the time, they were selling for $200-$500 for designer pairs. Through the 1990s, jeans remained a symbol of hipness. If you wanted a character to seem down to earth and fun in a movie, for example, you put her in jeans. During the 1990s, jeans changed. The politicians began wearing them to every barbecue and “meet the proles” political event. Seeing the people who made jeans hip in the 1960s turn them into a symbol of establishment compliance in the 1990s killed the buzz. Now, jeans are just part of the uniform. If you wear them, you’re normal. If not, you better belong to some kind of subculture — goth, hip-hop, etc. — or you’re just weird. Prole drift has changed our clothing from a desire to look elegant to a desire to fade into the background, lest the crowd notice you’re not exactly like them. “Burn the witch!” A teenager I know is a student at one of the fanciest prep schools in the country. He recently attended his senior prom. No expense was spared for the event, which was held in a major football stadium. (A father of a student owns the team that uses the stadium.) Limos were rented. Girls agonized over their gowns. Corsages were purchased. Pre-prom and pre-pre-pre-prom parties were held. What, you might wonder, was served to eat at this first formal occasion for these excited students? Pizza. The students stood around in their formal attire eating pizza. The pizza-fication of America proceeds apace. It is only a matter of time before pizza is served at all state dinners and banquets. Pizza is to modern cuisine what socialism is to political life. It represents the leveling of aspiration. It is the only significant consequence of radical democracy that Alexis de Tocqueville failed to predict. Pizza is the denim of dining. It even tastes like blue jeans. Pizza is the anti-soul food. – The Thinking Housewife Why bother thinking at all? No more wasting time on menus. The proles want pizza; give them pizza! It pleases everyone, or at least the statistical average, which means that no one can complain. Lowest common denominator achieved, soul sold to pander to the assembled multitudes, and we’re popular again. Pizza is barely even an Italian food, much less an American method of making it easier to produce fast food. No complicated bread here; just a simple dough, blasted in a high-heat oven. Get rid of those complicated calories and double up on the carbs and fat. It’s no wonder our society hates itself. It has replaced every sense of grace, aspiration and hope with a desire to fit in and be just one of the proles. This is why prole drift carries such a heavy weight of entropy and, to the erudite observer, presages the Fall. Tags: crowdism"
"UPDATE: Reading the release a little more carefully, this is the first budget cut in Texas in 50 years. I have no idea when the last other state was to actually reduce spending. I would welcome if anyone has the answer to this question. Via the Texas Public Policy Foundation, the Texas Legislature has reached a deal for the upcoming fiscal which actually cuts government spending. This is not a reduction in the rate of growth, it is not a cut based on a proposed budget, it is not a series of accounting gimmicks, the State of Texas will actually spend less money next fiscal year than it did last year. In so doing, it will be the first state in 50 years to actually implement a real reduction in spending. From the TPPF release: This state budget deal is a victory for all Texans – and especially for the Texans who worked hard over the past several months to remind our legislators that they wanted a fiscally conservative state budget. The announced budget deal is a win for Texas on three specific points: • It does not use a single penny of the rainy day fund for the next biennium. • It does not raise taxes. • It does represent the first all-funds reduction to a biennial state budget in the past half-century. “What happened in the Texas Legislature this session is more than just a victory for Texans. It’s a victory for America. Texas already leads the way in job creation, economic vitality, and economic liberty. Now Texas is leading the way in the most important cause facing our country: the need to live within our means. “Today, in Austin, Texas, the men and women of our legislature showed it can be done. That’s a tremendous accomplishment for Texas – and it’s a shining beacon of hope for America.” Indeed. Let us hope that John Boehner is paying attention – this is the kind of leadership the American people expect from Congress. Not budget gimmicks, not reductions in the rate of the Federal Government’s growth, but some evidence that the government is actually spending less from year to year. And while liberals and go-along-get-along Republicans claim that actual cuts to government spending will create economic disaster, the experience in Texas proves the exact opposite, as Texas remains the strongest state in the country in terms of economic growth. Cut the budget. Make government smaller. Grow American businesses. Texas is proving it can be done. "
"Trending: Anne Sinclair (C), wife of Dominique Strauss-Kahn, and daughter, Camille Strauss-Kahn, leave court following Dominique Strauss-Kahn's grand jury indictment at New York City's State Supreme Court on May 19, 2011 in New York City. Dominique Strauss-Khan was granted $1million cash bail and will be placed under 24-hour home detention with electronic monitoring. Local, foreign and international media outlets wait outside Rikers Island for the exit of former head of the IMF Dominique Strauss Kahn, Friday, May 20, 2011 in New York. Former International Monetary Fund leader Dominique Strauss-Kahn, center, talks with his attorney William Taylor, left, as he leaves court court after his bail hearing in New York state Supreme Court, Thursday, May 19, 2011. A judge set bail at $1 million Thursday, and approved an elaborate arrangement under which the 62-year-old diplomat and banker would be confined to a private apartment in Manhattan and monitored by armed guards. Back when he was still the officially designated Next President of France and not an accused rapist, Dominique Strauss-Kahn was glimpsed at the annual IMF soccer tournament wearing a T-shirt emblazoned “YES, WE KAHN!” (Monsieur le directeur was not participating in the game: The field he likes to play requires more horizontal exertions, as even the deferential and protective French media have begun belatedly to acknowledge.) In consciously mimicking the slogan of another and very successful presidential candidate, the IMF boss and Socialist Party candidate improved upon it – or, at any rate, made it more accurate. “Yes, We Can”? Er, no, actually, you can’t. But yes, he Kahn! A man is innocent until proven guilty, and it will be for a New York court to determine what happened in M Strauss-Kahn’s suite at the Sofitel. It may well be that’s he the hapless victim of a black Muslim widowed penniless refugee maid – although, if that’s the defense my lawyer were proposing to put before a Manhattan jury, I’d be inclined to suggest he’s the one who needs to plead insanity. Whatever the head of the IMF did or didn’t do, the reaction of the French elites is most instructive. “We and the Americans do not belong to the same civilization,” sniffed Jean Daniel, editor of Le Nouvel Observateur, insisting that the police should have known that Strauss-Kahn was “not like other men” and wondering why “this chambermaid was regarded as worthy and beyond any suspicion.” Bernard-Henri Lévy, the open-shirted, hairy-chested Gallic intellectual who talked Sarkozy into talking Obama into launching the Libyan war, is furious at the lèse-majesté of this impertinent serving girl and the jackanapes of America’s “absurd” justice system, not to mention this ghastly “American judge who, by delivering him to the crowd of photo hounds, pretended to take him for a subject of justice like any other.” Well, OK. Why shouldn’t DSK (as he’s known in France) be treated as “a subject of justice like any other”? Because, says BHL (as he’s known in France), of everything that Strauss-Kahn has done at the IMF to help the world “avoid the worst.” In particular, he has made the IMF “more favorable to proletarian nations and, among the latter, to the most fragile and vulnerable.” What is one fragile and vulnerable West African maid when weighed in the scales of history against entire fragile and vulnerable proletarian nations? Yes, he Kahn! POLITICAL CARTOONS: Arnold Schwarzenegger Before you scoff at Euro-lefties willing to argue for 21st century droit de seigneur, recall the grisly eulogies for the late Edward Kennedy. “At the end of the day,” said Sen. Evan Bayh, “he cared most about the things that matter to ordinary people.” The standard line of his obituarists was that this was Ted’s penance for Chappaquiddick and Mary Jo Kopechne – or, as the Aussie columnist Tim Blair put it, “She died so that the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act might live.” Great men who are prone to Big Government invariably have Big Appetites, and you comely serving wenches who catch the benign sovereign’s eye or anything else he’s shooting your way should keep in mind the Big Picture. Yes, Ted Ken! Nor are such dispensations confined to Great Men’s trousers. Timothy Geithner failed to pay the taxes he owed the United States Treasury but that’s no reason not to make him head of the United States Treasury. His official explanation for this lapse was that, unlike losers like you, he was unable to follow the simple yes/no prompts of Turbo Tax: In that sense, unlike the Frenchman and the maid, Geithner’s defense is that she wasn’t asking for it – or, if she was, he couldn’t understand the question. Nevertheless, just as only Dominique could save the European economy, so only Timmy could save the U.S. economy. Yes, they Kahn! How’s that working out? In the U.S., Geithner is currently running around bleating that we need to raise the $14 trillion debt ceiling another couple of trillion. On the Continent, the IMF, an institution most Westerners vaguely assume is there as a last resort for Third World basket cases, is intimately involved in the ever more frantic efforts to save the Euro from collapse. Good thing we had these two indispensable men on the case, or who knows how bad things would be. The arrest of a mediocre international civil servant in the first-class cabin of his jet isn’t just a sex story: It’s a glimpse of the widening gulf between the government class and their subjects in a post-prosperity West. Neither Geithner nor Strauss-Kahn have ever created a dime of wealth in their lives. They have devoted their careers to “public service,” and thus are in the happy position of rarely if ever having to write a personal check. At the Sofitel in New York, DSK was in a $3,000-per-night suite. Was the IMF picking up the tab? If so, you the plucky U.S. taxpayer paid around 550 bucks of that, whereas Strauss-Kahn’s fellow Frenchmen put up less than $150. So if, as Le Nouvel Observateur suggests, France and America really do belong in entirely different civilizations, the French one ought to start looking for a new patron for the heroic DSK’s lifestyle. Full disclosure: I’ve often stayed at the Sofitel myself, though without billing Western taxpayers for the pleasure. Nor do I generally require the three-grand suite. Given how comfortable the Sofitel’s more modest accommodations are, I wonder whether even M Strauss-Kahn does. Especially when he’s presiding over an IMF with a budget deficit of some $400 million. But perhaps it would be unreasonable to ask so famously unzippered a man to tighten his belt. After all, according to Ben Stein, my former colleague at The American Spectator, DSK is “one of the most recognizable people on the planet.” Many’s the time I’ve seen him exiting a swank restaurant with Justin Bieber and Lindsay Lohan and said, “Hey, there’s Dominique Strauss-Kahn with Wossname and Thingummy!” Fortunately, when the burdens of recognizability get too great, M Strauss-Kahn is able to retreat to his house in Washington, or his apartment in Paris, or his second apartment in Paris, or his riad in Marrakesh. Oh, c’mon, you provincial bozos: A “riad” is a palatial Moorish residence built around an interior courtyard. Everyone knows that. A lifetime of devoted “public service” in “socialist” France isn’t yet as remunerative as in Mubarak’s Egypt or Saddam’s Iraq, but we’re getting there. As the developed world drowns under the weight of Big Government, the gilded princelings of statism will hunker down in their interior courtyards and guard their privileges ever more zealously. Once in a while, as in that Manhattan hotel suite, a chance encounter between the seigneurs and their subjects will go awry, but more often, as in the Geithner confirmation, it will be understood that the Great Men of the Permanent Governing Class cannot be bound by the rules they impose on the rest of you schmucks. Yes, they Kahn. You, not so much. After Charlie Rangel, chair of the House committee that writes America’s tax laws, was “censured” by Congress for multiple infractions of, er, America’s tax laws, a Washington Times reporter invited him to imagine what punishment the “average American citizen” would have received had he done what the Congressman did. “Please,” Rangel told her. “I don’t deal in average American citizens.” If only. ©MARK STEYN steyn Get the latest news delivered daily!

"The headlines say it all: ""Chinese video game targets American troops"" ""Watch China kill American soldiers in new video game"" It sounds outrageous. But is it really? For starters: Let's accept that there are video games that allow you to shoot other people. Whether they are soldiers, mobsters, or even innocent bystanders, some of the most popular games in the world right now involve shooting people. The debate over whether that's right or wrong is one for another place and time. ""Glorious Mission"" is a PC game developed in China that bears an uncanny resemblance to many of those games. It is a first-person shooter much like the ""Call of Duty"" series, except it stars Chinese troops - and the enemies are apparently American soldiers. The game was co-developed by the People's Liberation Army's Nanjing branch, and is (for now) intended for use by soldiers as a training aid. The idea of a game being developed and used by a nation's military might seem unusual, but it's not a new one. In fact, the United States did the same thing nine years ago: ""America's Army"" acted as both a training tool and a public relations campaign to drive recruitment when it was released in 2002. Unlike Glorious Mission, America's Army featured generic enemies that had no set nationality. But that doesn't mean other developers haven't used the Chinese as villains. The last two ""Operation Flashpoint"" games, both developed and published by British firm Codemasters, put you in the shoes of American troops fighting the PLA. ""Battlefield 2"", developed by Sweden's DICE and published by U.S. giant Electronic Arts, has the PLA as a potential side to play as or against, pitting them against American Marines or a Middle Eastern coalition. Curiously, there is one game that thought about using the Chinese as antagonists... and chose not to. ""Homefront"" tells the story of an Asian nation invading the United States: North Korea. Why not China? An executive at the game's publisher THQ told Kotaku: ""They're just not that scary."" He argues that the relationship between the U.S. and China is too friendly now to make them good villains. Admittedly, there aren't many games that have Chinese villains. (They certainly aren't as popular as Russian bad guys are right now.) But they exist, and they fail to draw much comment when they do appear. So why is the reverse scenario anything to sit up and take notice of? I would rather my troop get actual experience then have them sit on a couch and play a game. Who do you think would win, troops that have been fighting for the last 20 years or some farm boys from a rice field playing video games? You choose. ""So why is the reverse scenario anything to sit up and take notice of?"" Why does  always do this? You write more than 5 paragraphs about it and then at the end ask, ""why is this news?"" Well gee, I don't know. Why don't you tell me? You are the one blogging about it, in fact I hadn't seen anything about it until you wrote about it here...perhaps its people like you perpetuating it as a story, when it is not? Well I guess they have to be able to beat us some how :). The only thing even semi-concerning about this is ""IF"" it was asked to be developed by the Chinese Gov.. and that Gov.. specifically asked for the enemies to be American Service Members. If that is true then yes it would be a little strange but I am just not worried about them. People always talk about the 1million man Army china has.. well that makes lots of targets. Not to mention the amount of necessities (food, water, equipment etc...) that it would take to invade America. They would have to conquer Canada or Mexico just to get a running start. Personally I would have to agree with THQ ""they're just not that scary."" they really aren't scary IMO. meh, its allright. I shot my fair of Asians in my time. I played Fallout 3, shows US troops killing Chinese. Don't make a big deal out of it, we started the ball rolling. We can picture the Russians, South Americans, Chinese, and just about any country as ""terrorists"" or ""enemy"" groups, yet freak out when someone has the US as villains in a game. Good grief... Having played BattleField2 (BF2) many time which in varying maps pitches the US military versus a fictitious Middle Eastern force or the Chinese army I don't see any complaint about this as being anything other than ridiculous hypocrisy. When we stop building games that have us shooting other nations' soldiers then we'll have a leg to stand on. Until then, shush. I am very eager interested to see the tiercdion that this blog will take, and will be keeping a close and analytical eye on it as it develops. I'm not sure that I entirely agree that games can essentially be divided between the ludic and narrative varieties. I believe that our medium's story telling is at it's best when the gameplay reenforces whatever theme the work is trying to portray, much like any good thesis. Considering I have yet to see you dissect a game yet, perhaps it's a tad premature to disagree on a subject just yet. I am excited to see where this goes, and would like to be the first to throw Mother 3 on the request list. Best of luck. Personally I don't see the big deal with what China is doing with there video games. America has created video games video games with enemies like North Korea and Russia and you don't hear many people complain. It would be hypocritical for the USA to argue against American soldiors used as the enemy when we continuously do the exact same thing. Of course its wrong, its only ok when you play an American and are shooting ""bad guys"". My balls hurt. So we can make violent games about killing them and Now they can't make games about U.S.A? Does this mean Red Dawn is going to get published finally as it was intended? This is just plain out wrong, china certainly has no respect for the U.S, already they are proclaiming superiority over us, we wouldn't ever have made a game with the U.S fighting china. all of our games fight terrorists, who only seek to kill innocent civilians, what a slap in the face of liberty. ‎""The United States is like giant boiler. Once the fire is lighted under it, there is no limit to the power it can generate."" -Winston Churchill and how is this any different from many of the top titles, especially the call of duty series targeting Russians? They should not be doing this, the games that target china aren't US military made games. This might be a bit of a political problem for china, especially if we are trying to strengthen military ties with each other. Frankly I do have an issue with this, if we are going to be allies we shouldn't have a MILITARY made war game targeting an allied nation. But hey if they want a war, we'll give 'em war. damn straight my friend its kind off cool. i dont see the problem its just games shitt... we do it in the us all the time. Stop being so thin skinned. We've been kill off the entire world for years within all our games. Whiners. Who gives a crap!!! Who cares, I don't think this is going to hurt relations. No worse then playing paintball against each other. Um, I'm going to assume you are joking zyan. A lot of American games and movies have foreign nations (Russia, Bosnia, Korea etc.) as the ""bad guys"". Shouldn't make a difference if it's the other way around. This is interesting and newsworthy for several reasons. The first is who is behind the game – the PLA. It would seem that they view the United States and her Soldiers (Sailors, Marines, etc.) as a potential enemy. The continued expansion of their military strength (driven by their economic engine), specifically their navy should be news... and this growing juggernaut has the United States in its sights. The game teaches their soldiers to see US troops as hostile. This is an important step in training your soldiers to kill an enemy. In this case, a specific enemy, a US Soldier. The second important lesson to take from this is that if there is a conflict with China, the United States will not have as distinct a technological advantage as they did during the Korean War. During the Korean War the US had air and sea superiority on a peninsula. The Chinese had decent equipment and massive numbers to counter this. The difference today is that the Chinese still have superior numbers but they have come a long way in shrinking the technological gap. A trump card for the US has been the persistent fighting that they have been involved in for the past 10 years. While it has not involved large scale armies, it has taught many lessons of leadership to junior and senior US commanders. This cannot be discounted. The current US force is exceptionally well trained and motivated and would be a terrifying enemy. It would be amazingly foolish if these two great civilizations decide that fighting is better than working together to solve the problems of the world. And there are many problems to be addressed. I see the game mentioned above as more of a PR nightmare for the Chinese than a successful training tool. It has the potential to disrupt US/Chinese relations and will be a limited tool for training. Check the butt of the gun for the Manufacturing label... Seriously.... why should we be offended? If anything, we should take it as a complement. They apparently see our military as a big enough threat on a global scale to train useing us as a prime example of what they'll be up agenst. No biggie. Are the Germans bent over backwords because we've been making WWII games about them for more than 20 years? At least this is more like a complement than an insult. As a game is understandable. We have our games to shoot every type of nationality. I don't really agree that it's used train military though. A case like that the enemy shouldn't be given a nationality. Seems like they are trained to recognize and kill American soldiers then. rofl at america and there double standards. ""all of our games fight terrorists.."" what a bunch of crap. there are a number of games where american forces fight china. and that Winston Churchill quote, speaks more about the human spirit then america. hell i remember last year america getting upset cause china has themselves a stealth fighter. you guys are going to get the shock of your lives when you actually fight an army the doesnt have to resort to throwing stones at you, that have the same tech you and have greater numbers. I think what you're all ignoring, is that this country values free speech, this includes game developers like activision (call of duty) – completely independent of their governments views, depicting its own villains. In our own branches ""Americas Army"" game, no nation is depicted as the villain. Meanwhile, we have the entire nation of China pushing a game, depicting the U.S. as the main target. Ours sounds like a training simulator on paper. Theirs sounds like a battle emulator, with a very clear enemy. Tl:Dr – Maybe this isn't a big deal, but I think a 'government' game with an ally as its main villain, has a deeper meaning. Chinese nukes wins! I play COD, BF2, and FO2 and many more. There is no difference than U.S gamers running around BOPS shooting up Somalians, Russians, Chinese, or Al Qiada. TAYLOR WREN is right. We as gamers would be hypocrites if we made a big deal about another nations preference of ""an enemy"". , gamers know you're just trying to stur the pot for protest. I'm sure many gamers in the U.S has friended a Chinese gamer to their friends list thanks to Internet capablity. I kill Chinese in Fallout 3. Hey Adam,I want to suggest an roappach to defining games that I may have hinted at during the course but that I never really expanded on. One of the central concerns of semiotic (semiotic proper, not dumbed-down) is the relational aspect of semiosis (meaning-making). Modernity's separation of ontology and epistemology, because it doesn't value relations, is highlighted by the problem of defining games. Relations are objects in themselves but can also be subjective to the thing.As for your focus on the 'actuality' of games, there was an interesting article on Duns Scotus' haecceity and Peirce's conception of the indexical (J. DiLeo, Transactions of CSPeirce journal) that I'd recommend.Regarding Simondor's reply, I think some nuancing might be in order. Learning in games is not really learning to play but (and I think Galloway makes this point) learning the logic of the algorithm. For educational games, unless you expect them to learn through repetition your task is to translate your learning goal/concept into something that your 'players' can relate to abductively with the gained understanding (played?) of the algorithm. On a more practical level, I think DominiQC's roappach would be a good starting point with perhaps some drawbacks. On the one hand, there's always the instrumental player that'll speed through it (but this happens with most games anyway). On the other hand, it would be a terrific 'gamic wiki' of sorts but the problem would occur once the player is not playing the game. He/she will have relied on pop-ups to direct the logics of his architectural thinking and may not remember an important detail nor know how to verify for it. (of course, this argument might be moot if architects are forever to be using CAD software that will have these pop-ups integrated).Apologies for the ramblings.S Not worried about it. Mobilizing a massive army to travel either a) Over seas en mass or b) via polar regions would be like watching a bomb go off very slowly. You'd have plenty of time to react. They have a lot of people. We have lots of ways to kill people. If they tried a massive invasion it would be some serious population control. Besides, we're in bed with them anyway... First Flashpoint was not developed by Codemasters – Bohemia Interactive did it. well thats a stupid game, you could make it past the first level cause the americans would keep killing you (; MURICA! just a game,只是个游戏而已！ Sound like a great game only problem i see is the us army would kill each other before you could kill them. To many people we are the enemy anyway. We have COD, Modern warfare, ghost recon and so on. Let them have their fun. We know we do. I'm a gamer and former military. I'm not raising a stink over it. Um....Americans have been doing the same thing for years. Call of Duty anyone? I played the new chinese game and they kept it true! There is no way to ""win"" the game, you just keep getting your ass handed to you, level after level. We have plenty of games were the Chinese are the bad guys, and you don't see their media complaining. But when they make a game where we are the bad guys our media makes a huge stink about it. Come on grow up . So let me get this straight, MGM had to moth ball the RED DAWN remake for at least a year after finishing it while going bankrupt and then goes back and re edit the flags to make it look like North Korea's invading us (yeah right, and the world is really gonna end today at 6pm) because nobody wants to hurt China's feelings, and they go an do THIS?! Screw it, MGM take the original cut ship out and show it around mid June. Why waste time and money (money MGM desperately needs) trying to be PC about China's feelings when they don't do the same? If they want to go to war with us, fine. We have the better trained personal, who are also battle harden thanks to Iraq and Afghanistan and tech that is around 10 years more advanced then theirs. And if they do invade, they're also gonna have to contend with the gun nuts who've been preparing for something like this as well, and G0D bless them too. WOLVERINES!!!!!!! OH NO!!!! It's really Ender's Game!!!!! Don't play don't play!!!! man thats some bullshit we make video games that shoot them and the russians and the germans so why does it matter if they do this of us look at call of duty games and medel of honor games no hate seriously There's nothing wrong with them killing American soldiers in their games or fiction, hell WE kill American solider in our games in fiction. The problem is the government made it. When the government gets involded it's hard to just say ""Hey, it's all fun and games"" beause we actually expect our governments to behave seriously like adults so the only reason they would do this..... The scenario of Chinese troops fighting American troops is unlikely. Why ? Because a bully which America is will not pick on somebody that will cause them equal or more damage. Besides America is in so much debt to to China that they would sink if they attacked China. Carl: ""Who do you think would win, troops that have been fighting for the last 20 years or some farm boys from a rice field playing video games? You choose."" I point to you Alvin York, a country boy that puts every current military person to shame. Perhaps you should go back to school and learn the country boys actually spent their LIVES killing things, like bears, coyotes, wolves, cougars, deer, boar, and more, to keep their farms safe and to keep their families fed. You boys spend 1,000+ rounds for every enemy KIA. Most rednecks I know can actually hit their intended target, drunk as a skunk. Most of today's Marines that I've seen can't even hold the gun properly. You choose poorly. China will grow larger. We build for China. I am fine with this as long as they dont care when we make a game of similar circumstances that involves us throwing knives into the back of a chinese soldiers head No one has any reason to complain about this. Other games have been made where we kill other countries also. Some shithead in the comments said this was a slap in te face of liberty because the Chinese say they're n a better position than the u.s. Well guess what, you're saying your country is better than theirs, so look at this! Full circle! You americans are so dumb. Chinese owns the US, although admittedly you both do rely on each other. The way things are now, nothing can be done because the US owes china so much debt but the chinese economy relies heavily on the US purchasing their junk. Yeah it is just a game. This is a silly news reported by  Senior Producer, Ravi Hiranand. What a nonsense! This sound racist to me.Why is Ravi making a big fuss on it? Who cares, its just a game and its not like we have not done it in the past. I used to played USAF janes combat simulation a long time ago and basically it was about russians or germans attacking the USA. Any powerfull contry will use this tactic to brainwash there citizens and make them more patriotic. I bet you there will be some politicians that will try to stop that game from entering the USA or being downloaded because its not patriotic and i agree. Compare American Soldier Vs Chinese Soldier without arms. Compare American Soldier Vs Chinese Soldier with American Soldier with defective Chinese spring especially made for American Soldier while Chinese dude holding the real stuff... In the fantasy world of video games, nationalism gets checked at the door when you press start. Even so, I honestly can't imagine Chinese developers making a lot of games in which their own army is the primary antagonist. FWIW – I *believe* the other ""bad guy"" countries buy Chinese made assault weapons and firearms. It'll insult current Chinese weapons clients to feature ""terror groups"" as targets as they buy the goods. Just a thought though... If we do it on our video games , why can't they do it? no harm there. The difference is people(and how have you all not noticed this) that this Chinese game is sponsored by their government. Our ""official"" game had generic opponents. Their government literally wanted to put Americans as the enemy, nothing generic(unlike America's Army). Now mind you placing Americans as an enemy is more than fair, but the fact that it has not only the governments seal of approval, but was created by them. Disturbing much? nice... 😀 If you're questioning why you think this is news worthy... well you obviously read the article.  WIN. The Chinese gov't isn't naive, they have a military with a very large % of educated young people, and they know very well the greatest threat to they could face is the U.S. They're training accordingly. Our youth often take pride in mowing down any opposition playing as our countries finest, why would we expect anything different. It's more important that we make it a conversation and realize the horror that any such war would bring. It's best that we all just get along. hmm, and what is the problem? I have been looking around, and the game seems okay. It's just a game... relaaaaax! I like China vs US in wargames. It makes for an interesting hypothetical situation. It was great fun in Battlefield 2, so I don't have a problem with Chinese game dev's using us as the villain. Fun stuff! This should be a difficult game to win if it is truly realistic... oh no it is a video game, gasp help us lord. I wana play it @arathans: Actually in the context that Mr. Churchill spoke was obviously directed specifically at the ""United States"" because conflict after conflict, and generation after generation, no matter who the enemy has been America's military has proven over and over that they are a force not to be trifled with. Even outside of the military the majority of American civilians own many weapons and know how to use them. Have fun going door to door with that little piece of information. lets take a look at some battles from the US Marines history just to make the point. ""1805, 7 U.S. Marines and 400 Libyan men under the command of Marine Lieutenant Presley O'Bannon took the city of Tripoli"" ""The War of 1812, 114 Marines and Sailors halted the advance of 4,000 British troops."" with the British commanding officer quoted as saying ""They have given us our only real fight."" 1900 ""The Boxer rebellion had Marines defending one wall against 50,000 chinese and those Marines held that wall for 54 days waiting for relief."" Private Dan Daily would defend this position single handedly while waiting for this relief. Belleau Wood WWII ""Germans would come to classify Marines as ""Shock Troops"" and the term Devil Dog was coined from this battle as well. Wake Island WWII ""The first assault on wake by the Japanese ended with 3 Japanese ships sunk, and 600 Japanese soldiers dead while only 4 Marines and one plane were lost."" This list goes on and on and its only the Marines, combine the Army, Navy, and Air Force, not to mention most civilians, and any invading force will have a serious fight on their hands. This is repeated by US Marines over 300 times since 1775. The amount of casualties inflicted upon invading forces at anytime in Americas history has always been the most significant and would not be any different today. American army is modern version of natzis....conquer other countries,make chaos,take feedstock (oil) and than leave... Korea,Vietnam,Iraq,Afghanistan,Libya...they can judge and kill anybody without consequences...i can't see difference between them I just took floor sweepings and and brewed them in a coffee maker. As I drink this, I ask you- Why do I think this is coffee? Big difference is between real facts and false conviction,i supose:) So, is it going to be translated to English for us Americans? It sounds interesting, I kind of want to try it out. 呵呵，有敌人不好么，你把对方当敌人，对方也把你当敌人。大家在竞技一起成长，没有敌人是非、 常可怕的。。。。 Even in todays American churches men women and children are being programed to hate people of other Ethnic backgrounds. Example; Jeremiah Wright... Our nation is slowly turning its heart against Isreal and Jewish people ( I am not Jewish ). They are changing policy to adopt the hate and prejudice of the Arab world. America is in a Empathetic drought...What do they teach in school...NEVER DO THEY TECH CHILDREN TO PLAY A ROLE IN LOOKING OUT FOR THE SAFETY AND WELFARE OF OTHERS ( TO LOVE PEOPLE AROUND THEM ) Instead, its ""all about ME"" mentalty. Yet you have the media somehow being hypocritical of other cultures... Is it any wonder our prison system is full to capacity. Chinese are coming once they ruin our economy. Americans will only wake up once they put 3 million troops here. Obama is clue-less, Hillary is silent, Pelosi & Reid are looting the Treasury. Americans only want to watch Arnold on TV and Facebook. Americans don't think is bad making war games agaist other coutryes , why are they think this is bad agaist them? What comes around ,goes around. I suppose it's more interesting that shooting unarmed people from Tibet and Taiwan. China wants to rule the world make no mistake about that. Buy USA products if there still are any except for wepons. I love how  always manages to start controversy where there is none. The USA and China getting into a war would be mutually destructive. If China somehow destroyed the USA, the world economy would collapse. If USA somehow destroyed China, the world economy would collapse. This is riduclous. People get mad when there is a game where American Soldiers are harmed, but when there is a game about American Soldiers killing other countries' soldiers it's just fine. Grow the FU** up. As a gamer who has been at it for years, i can tell you we have made games pitted against many countries. Having also served in the Air Force, people need to realize that American are seen as a target to some and a hard one at that. We have the greatest military force on the planet and its only natural in a video game to target the best. If a country is going to train thier military why not have them train again the best. Doesnt mean they are planning a invasion. Its just a game. Call of Duty: not only do you shoot at Americans, but at Russians, Vietnamese and even Mexican Rebels. So why is this such a big deal? Well, as game enemies we have been using latinos, asiatics, and else. So, what is the problem if they use us as losers, too??? what he said! Live by the sword, die by the sword. Imagine if another army invaded us and its soldiers raped, murdered and tortured our citizens. Now imagine if that nation demanded that its troops were always portrayed as the good guys in all books, games and movies. How would you feel? Like an Iraqi Like an Afghani Like a Libyan Like a Vietnamese Like a Laotion Like a Somili Like a Cuban Like an Iranian or Like an American seriously does this have to be news so what china made a videogame that has china shooting at america where have we seen something like this before seriously let them how often have american made video games with Americans fighting other countries They already have a target on our the head our economy, as they continue to undervalue their currancy to create a 270 billion trade deficit with the US in 2010 alone. Its no surprise that they are now placing a target on the heads of our soldiers, if only in a video game. really? we have CoD:americans killing russians, we have Homefront:americans killing north Koreans. Why cant we have chinese kill americans? you mad? You have to be kidding to not take situations like that described in the article seriously. I have watched children playing these sorts of games on their home computers and am very concerned! Poisoning young Chinese minds against foreign American looking troops in a violent military-style videogame is unilateral and anti-social. In fact, you'd think, as a young Chinese, that Americans weren't allies and business partners. The game's name is reckless, also, and irresponsible. Warnings that parents can read should be posted all over the game and the 'net about the intent and meaning of the game's creation. I still have troubling thoughts about what happened in Japan when their subway was attacked by a cult leader who used poison gas and killed people, and in a way, this game could be used as a psychological weapon, affecting both Chinese and American national interests. Please watch out for games like this! Ok, american games show Americans killing all kinds of races, and do the other countries complain? NO! And american movies keep displaying Asian people as bad guys. Finally some thing hits it back at the Americans. Now just keep it coming and let's see how Americans feel. look at you guys, picking on america. why dont you take pride in your country and want your country to be #1? Fallout 3 had Chinese enemies, yes. But they also had the US government as enemies. It really didn't depict one as being worse than the other. This is nothing new. It's conditioning. We have been doing it for years. It would be hypocritical for us Americans to get wound up over this. However, it should make you think. The unsettling part is not that the game pits chinese against us. The issue that makes me take notice is that this game was developed for and by the Chinese military, exclusively at the moment. China has plenty of much closer enemies than us (Thailand, North Korea, Japan, etc) so why is this game teaching Chinese soldiers that Americans are a primary target? There our friend in trade, yet our enemy. What a funny relationship we have with China. Our gamers are better than China's gamers......We've got this one in the bag;D Playstation network or no playstation network. We will not tire, we will not falter and we will not failXD I do not have a problem with the shooting games. Hell let anyone shoot at anything they want in front of their TV. What ever game they want to play is up to them. I have a problem with the following. The game was co-developed by the People's Liberation Army's Nanjing branch, and is (for now) intended for use by soldiers as a training aid. Chinese Military and the wack jobs that run that country are training for a face off against the USA. And  blows it off as well its just a game. That is the problem. Their main target like Japan (over half a decade ago) is America. whats Thailand gonna do when all hell breaks loose? One million Chinese will over ran Thailand like locusts on a plantation. I see. I hope you let us know what you've discovered, eubacse I'm finding your attempt fascinating. I'd like to see if it evolves into a rock band , or a cooperative, or maybe something new and different.I think one of interesting aspects of this experiment is how you're not explicitly putting everyone in the same company, but you're still going to create teams. In my experience, company cultures have always been less about employer-employee relations, and more about how peers treated each other. In your case, you're not going to have a shared employer, but you are still going to have peers, and you're going to need to negotiate all the usual stuff with them, such as the way you share resources, responsibilities, and benefits.Now, I'm not saying all this so I can be a smartass. I hope you do well, but I have an even bigger hope that what you're doing can be replicated. 🙂 You can only replicate something if you know what makes it tick, hence the question. do not worry i shoot every one in my game All your base are belong to us. You guys are missing the point. The game is for soldiers to train with so it's sponsored by the Chinese government. it's not a retail game for kids to play. It's a government tool to train their soldiers on how to kill American solderis. How is no one raising an eye brow?!?!??!?!?! You people are seriously retarded if you think it's the same as the games America puts out. Fallout 3 is a game that takes place hundreds of years in the future so it's all hypothetical. Same with games that has us fighting the Russians. Plus, like I said earlier, they are retail games to play and have fun with. Not to train soldiers on a possible invasion. If movies like Rambo can show heroic mission of American with Taleban help against USSR, why the reverse is a problem???!!! Be more free-mined American. it is ignorant of Americans to care if they are virtually represented in a video game, just a few weeks ago homefront came out where the north Koreans where negatively portrayed as the ""bad guys"" invading the united states. There is nothing w rong with using Americans as ""bad guys"" especially when Americans are often out ""liberating"" other countries. You must remember it is just a game, a fantasy, or even illusion. in a computer soccer game, u can play choose any country as opponent and according to real world ranking opponents skill are changed. As this chinese game is for Military training purpose, it is normal to have different country as enemy (also skills of enemy will vary). in this case, America is potential enemy of china,can you deny it? so, why is the fussssssssssssssss!!!!! @Carl 1st commentor, are you serious? have you heard of america's army? it's a game that was created by the U.S. army despairbring on October 20, 2011 The Twilight Game would be awseome! You could play as sall the different vampires (Edward as the main character) and while you venture through the game, you find out about the secrets of the vampires, and battle some werewolves, Carnivores, Etc.The battling could be RPG Based, like final fantasy.or proper real-time combat like the Matrix.and you could have various missions on it for example: Kill 50 Werewolves in 3 Minutes.The game too could be combined with the movie clips. I'll post this on my facebook wall is there another word for thank you? cause i really need to thank the author for this Are humans destined to fight and kill each other? If that is the case, we are just like games and toys played either by ""Gods"" or some kind of invisible force. Well, I say it's a little scary because it was made by the PRC for their own soldiers. If it was intended for entertainment purposes then I really wouldn't care. Sure, the US military has games for soldiers but, as the article points out with AA, they depict generic nations. This game (which I emphasize is for PRC soldiers for TRAINING) is obviously intended to simulate a war against the US. Hey folks, Is going to be the U.S. much better off keeping Syria's Assad? How is it different when US-Troopers shoot at Russians? xD (in almost every shoote game out there!)  welcomes a lively and courteous discussion as long as you follow the Rules of Conduct set forth in our Terms of Service.

"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has accused Western countries of plotting to ""cause drought"" in Iran by using high tech equipment to drain the clouds of raindrops. Moments after the Iranian president made the startling claim at the inauguration of a dam in a central province, it started to rain. ""Western countries have designed plans to cause drought in certain areas of the world, including Iran,"" Mr Ahmadinejad said in the city of Arak in Markazi province. ""According to reports on climate, whose accuracy has been verified, European countries are using special equipment to force clouds to dump"" their water on their continent, he said. By doing so, ""they prevent rain clouds from reaching regional countries, including Iran,"" Mr Ahmadinejad charged. Iran has experienced several droughts in recent years. Mr Ahmadinejad also recalled an article by ""a Western politician,"" whom he did not identify, in which ""droughts in some regions spanning from Turkey and Iran to east of Asia are predicted for the next 30 years."" ""The regions (referred to in) the article ... include countries whose culture and civilisation frighten the West,"" Mr Ahmadinejad said in support of his argument. Iranian leaders claim on a daily basis that Western countries, led by arch-foe United States, devise ""plots"" to undermine the Islamic republic and to impede its economic and scientific development. They also accuse world powers of colluding against Iran's national unity, independence, political establishment, culture as well as international relations. Mr Ahmadinejad is involved in an unprecedented power struggle with the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. He recently refused to obey orders handed down by Ayatollah Khamenei less than two years after the pair formed a powerful political alliance to defeat anti-regime protests that swept the country."
"Submit Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. ( ) President Obama’s re-election campaign is trying to dig up dirt in the Garden State. Despite New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie’s repeated pronouncements that he will not seek the GOP presidential nomination, Obama operatives are compiling a dossier of what they call “opposition research” — material that could be used to damage Christie if he changes his mind, The Post has learned. The Obama campaign is trying to keep its efforts from public view, concerned they would only elevate Christie’s already impressive standing within the Republican Party, sources said. The operatives have chosen not to dispatch their own people to New Jersey, but instead are talking to people there and in New York who know Christie from his time in the governor’s office, as a gubernatorial candidate and as US attorney. Obama’s campaign manager, Jim Messina, did not respond to messages. Christie has repeatedly — and colorfully –said he is not running for president in 2012. “Short of suicide, I don’t really know what I’d have to do to convince you people that I’m not running. I’m not running,” he’s insisted. But party leaders have been pushing Christie to enter the race, saying his brand of New Jersey tough talk could put the White House within reach for the GOP. Republican leaders from Henry Kissinger to House Speaker John Boehner have encouraged him to run. And well-heeled GOP donors in New York have been spreading word that Christie has privately shown a willingness to consider it. They say Christie might enter the race if he can get part of his pension-reform agenda passed in Trenton and score a GOP takeover of one of the Democratic-controlled houses of the state Legislature in November. Christie spokesman Mike DuHaime said, “This is just wishful thinking . . . He is not running, and he is not cracking the door open even a little bit.” But, DuHaime said, the efforts of the Obama camp are flattering. He said it’s “an acknowledgment that Christie is a bold leader successfully taking on big challenges as governor. A leader who cuts spending and takes on the special interests tends to earn notice at the highest levels.” Top Dems applauded Team Obama’s preparation. “It would be irresponsible for them to not start looking at it,” said a consultant who played a key role in Obama’s 2008 campaign. “It would be malpractice for them not to.” Meanwhile, there were other developments for the GO{: * Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels withdrew from the race for the presidential nomination. * Herman Cain, the former CEO of Godfather’s Pizza, announced a bid for the White House. * Former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, who is declaring his candidacy today, jumped the gun by releasing a video last night scooping his own announcement. Share Selection"
"by Brett Stevens on May 22, 2011 During the 1990s, the term “helicopter parent” emerged to refer to those who hover nearby, and with good intentions that seem covertly somewhat self-interested, and try to apply the “good” — safe, sociable, healthy, moral — to their children. But that itself seems to have self-interest in it. The helicopter parent wants their child to succeed, and part of that is being universally acclaimed as a winner, which means having the “right” opinions and behaviors. Namely, sharing your toys, being altruistic, being kind to the less fortunate. Among the wealth of America and Europe, such behaviors are recognized like a kind of code — a shibboleth even — shared by those who are successful or going to succeed by which they recognize one of their own. Such coded status-seeking behavior defines our social hierarchy. We have made the personal — the social — public, and now use it as a way to select those who will be our comrades, friends, lovers, business associates and service providers. Yet few mention that if we’re all equal, such selectivity should not be necessary. And the result? In a recent comprehensive study by scientists at Duke University, researchers have observed a sharp decline in social connectedness over the past 20 years. Remarkably, 25% of Americans have no meaningful social support at all – not a single person they can confide in. And over half of all Americans report having no close confidants or friends outside their immediate family. The situation today is much worse today than it was when similar data were gathered in 1985. (At that time, only 10% of Americans were completely alone). How could this happen? It’s hundreds of little things. You can probably think of several off the top of your head: the longer work hours, the Internet, the ubiquitous iPod . . . and don’t forget all the time spent sitting in traffic. According to Robert Putnam, sociologist and author of the influential book, Bowling Alone, for every 10 minutes added to commute time, there’s a roughly 10% decrease in social ties. – Psychology Today When you force inclusion of everyone, you force us to (in public) accept everyone and thus potentially be victims of their defects; if in public we must claim everyone is equal, we cannot shun some as defective even if they are predatory, insane, cruel or parasitic. Since we are forced by society at large to be inclusive of even those who will sabotage or destroy us, we withdraw — our public life becomes entirely false, and our private life becomes personal again in that we deal only with ourselves. Our cities are full of people living in apartments, eating take-out, socializing anonymously on the internet and doing other lonely things like paying for sex and joining meaningless activities to have “social time,” as if it’s a vitamin you need in certain dosages and otherwise irrelevant. Such behavior is an example of a logical fallacy of repeating what is done to you, to others; if someone takes your life away, make sure you take that life and live it only for yourself. You have done what they would do, but to your own advantage; in the meantime, life as a whole floats on by, unobserved by both parties. In turn we project our solipsism onto our children, producing another broken generation: Children are getting weaker as they spend more time indoors on the computer rather than outside according to a recently published study in Acta Paediatrica. 10-year-olds may be adept at moving their fingers over keyboards and using their thumbs to text, but they are not able to do push-ups and hang from bars in gym class as they used to, says one of the study’s authors, Gavin Sandercock, a children’s fitness expert of Essex University. However, the children in the study had the same body mass index (BMI) as those a decade earlier; this suggests that, in view of their strength declining, their bodies are likely to contain more fat than muscle. These are depressing findings, but they do seem to be corroborated by the realities of modern life, of children not able to play outside because of fears of safety, injury and — should a child be hurt falling out of some homeowner’s tree or on their driveway — lawsuits. – Care2 Life is risk and life is pain, but helicopter parents feel they will “look bad” if some form of injury or pain occurs. Similarly, our society is full of people who fear they will “look bad” if they do not tolerate every predator, parasite, criminal and pervert under the sky. Because we indulge these false pretenses, we have made modern society a trustless, lifeless, oblivious plain in which we wander, too afraid to make connections of emotional import."

"by Brett Stevens on May 24, 2011 In order to prove we are in control, us brave moderns deny the obvious if it does not conform to the type of boxy rule we use to impose order on the “chaos” of nature. While we like to think our rules are “logical,” what they really are is a fragmentary subset of reality, removed from context and any sense of cycle or cause/effect logic in a process over time. We take a conclusion or sum and use it as a symbol for the ongoing whole, as if trying to take a photograph and paste it over the complex, messy and uncontrollable reality. One of our favorite illusions is the happy thought that We Are All One, a sentiment (not logical analysis) which suggests that if we join hands, become one big group without enemies, and help each other freely, we will end conflict and violence. The implication of any homily so passionate, all-encompassing and gushingly positive is that you could not oppose it without desiring the opposite, which is assumed to be a world in which we are forever at war and hating one another. It’s like asking someone, “Did you stop hitting your wife yet? Yes or no answers only.” You know they’re caught in a logical trap which has no relation to reality itself. While we-are-all-one sounds good to our modern minds, it’s more like a statement of military allegiance. We are the army of the good, or even, we are all part of the machine. We serve the same master, which is peace at any cost! But there is a high cost: Liberals love to think of minorities as intrinsically virtuous beings capable of doing no wrong, but I love when their stupid double-standard is dissolved before their eyes when supposedly â€œhatefulâ€ topics start trending amongst black Twitter users. Most of the trending topics they describe as â€œhatefulâ€ are usually just comical, self-caricatures of black culture. Another double standard I would like to point out, is that if a group of predominantly white people started to trend the hashtag #howtokeepyobitchinline, that the feminist blogosphere would explode in a flurry of verbiage spouting off on the intrinsically violent and hateful patriarchy. Whites are held to a higher standard of political correctness than blacks. Why? – Sofiasty In the we-are-all-one world, the only threat is someone who isn’t part of the one. Someone who has risen above, pulled ahead, or even gotten something the rest of us do not have. That person is the new Satan who divides things up. What if you have a black majority that’s thriving, and a white minority that is not, as in South Africa? What if you have a white majority that is thriving, a black minority that is not, as in the United States and Europe? Suddenly, you’ve pitted the minority against the majority because the majority is presumed to be in violation of the ur-rule “we are all one.” Double standards, relativism, excuse-making and result fiddling await at that point. It’s an expensive illusion, to insist we are all one. Race is but one part. Assume an all-white nation, with poverty existing. Then you read this article: According to a study published this week by the Journal of the American Medical Association, distressing numbers of hospital emergency rooms have been steadily closing down over the last 20 years, just as hospital ER use is on the rise. The rate of closures is particularly high in urban areas, where the number of ERs has dropped a whopping 27% since 1990, leaving a dangerous service gap for those in need of care in many cities. Authors of the research warn the closure trend is a serious national health concern, since ERs are “the only place in the US health care system that serves all patients, emergency departments (EDs) are the ‘safety net of the safety net.'” This is especially alarming because the study also revealed that the demise of emergency rooms in America was disporportionately affecting the urban poor. – Care2 If you have we-are-all-one propaganda in your head, your first thought is that someone has a vendetta against the poor. First cutting out their medical care, then subjecting them to these horrible emergency rooms, and finally cutting those. What if we told you that most jobs offer medical benefits, from fast food on up, and that most states offer “indigent care” which is a type of state-sponsored health insurance for the destitute? Then we’re at a quandary: we know emergency rooms are closing because people are using them as primary health care, strangling the system under a backlog to the point where it closes emergency rooms because they cannot be relied on to provide emergency care. We now have two different realities: one in which the poor are victims, and one in which the poor are aggressors. If you can easily get medical care, why are you using emergency rooms as primary care? (Here in Texas, it’s generally because you’re an illegal alien. Others come for emergency; illegals know they can go to emergency rooms for any kind of care, get Spanish-language help and have no data trail left regarding their immigration status. But for now, pretend that isn’t the case.) Throughout history, opportunity has existed in abundance and competence, well, that has been harder to find. Most human beings are starving in areas where there is no shortage of arable land. What’s the difference between thriving and starvation? Organization: someone to save the seed corn, plant it at the right time, divert a river to irrigate it, get others to work the fields, fight off the parasitic species, and then harvest it at the right time and store it in a form that others can eat year-round. Societies where people do not starve tend to be those with a high degree of organization; societies where people starve are universally disorganized, criminal, predatory and superstitious. When we apply that to human individuals, we see that outside of a minority of people who end up temporarily poor and a minority of people who end up temporarily rich, most people who have money are that way because they got organized; most people who have no money are that way from a lack of organization. With that in mind, which is the more likely scenario: the poor as a perpetual victim, or the poor as aggressor that through its disorganization is wrecking our emergency rooms? This isn’t a “blame the poor” essay. If you know that one group in your society is disorganized, you don’t give them zero accountability primary health care through emergency care. You throw them out into the street so they don’t swarm the emergency care and your other citizens then cannot use it. It is this refusal to recognize the obvious that crushes us as a society. People are different; instead of denying this, we need to manage it. But that is an unpopular truth because it means that we have to tell some people that they’re screwing up by going to emergency services for primary care, that they’re not all-knowing wise beings who should make political decisions for the rest of us, or that their children didn’t make the cut into honors programs. To avoid that unpopularity, we instead make compromise decisions that viciously sabotage our social institutions. Much as we’ve wrecked hospitals, we’re working on wrecking education: Not long ago, honors courses were considered a hallmark of student achievement, a designation that impressed colleges and made parents beam. Now, those courses are vanishing from public schools nationwide as administrators move toward a more inclusive curriculum designed to encourage underrepresented minority students to join their high-achieving peers in college-level Advanced Placement classes. […] Honors courses are generally taught from the same lesson plan as regular classes but at a faster pace and in greater depth. An AP course contains altogether more-challenging material â€” charting a path that coheres to national standards, which are heavily endorsed by the Fairfax school system. This fall, Fairfax will discontinue honors-level courses in subjects where an AP class is offered, drawing the ire of parents who want to restore what they call an academic middle ground. They have formed a group called Restore Honors Courses. Prince William County took an even bolder stance about 10 years ago, doing away with the honors track. There has been resistance to that in other school systems â€” including Montgomeryâ€™s and Loudounâ€™s, where the honors option has been scaled back. – WAPO People were trying this back in the 1970s and 1980s in all-white schools, of course, so this issue is bigger than ethnicity. What to do if little Johnny or Julia is physically not as intelligent — we’re talking biologically intelligence potential, as measured through IQ — as other students? This means the little tyke is going to hang out in the unexceptional person classes and not get those good honors classes on the college transcript. In this situation, we could either accept reality and put the little blighter in the regular classes, or we could fake it and dumb down the honors classes so a vision of equality is achieved. This is what the teacher’s unions will suggest, anyway. Avoid controversy; make happy parents! It doesn’t really matter if we’re graduating subliterates, because we have avoided conflict. Peace reigns. We are all one. Mass delusions do not require reason or logic to gain converts. They only need to project the view that “everyone knows that …” “every schoolboy knows …” or “everybody believes that …” This false sense of security in perceived numbers of believers has taken in a huge number of pseudo-intellectuals within the academy, in journalism, in politics, and in popular media and entertainment. All the better to project the delusion of universal belief. – Al Fin For a species that spends a lot of time wondering why “we can’t all just get along,” we humans are remarkably unreflective about what ideas we consistently attempt that create consistent failure. But that’s secondary. What matters is that first and foremost, we have reached paradise. A paradise of mediocrity in a moribund nation-state, but we have made everyone happy. Thus even in death, we are all one."
"May 24, 2011 Hunter Wallace Alabama, BRA Economics, BRA Race Relations 11 Montgomery, Alabama, USA CSA Yesterday, I heard about the opening of the new Freedom Riders museum in Montgomery on the 50th anniversary of the Freedom Rides to Alabama. James Zwerg and Rep. John Lewis were on hand to wear the halo of righteous victimhood that always comes with being a Civil Rights Martyr (CRM). PBS has been airing a new two hour documentary that glorifies the Freedom Riders. You can watch it below. For some reason, I felt compelled to visit this newly constructed shrine of African-American victimhood in Black Run America. Unfortunately, I was dismayed upon my arrival to learn that the Freedom Riders Museum was not open to the public on a Monday afternoon at 12 PM, which has been labeled “a work day” by White people in the private sector. Having briefly lived in Montgomery in 1999, I was curious to see what the Civil Rights Movement had been about there. Every college student in America learns that the two iconic battles of the “Civil Rights Movement” in Montgomery were the Montgomery Bus Boycott of 1955 and the Freedom Riders Arrival in 1961. When I was living in Montgomery, I never knew anyone who either rode a Greyhound bus or relied upon public transportation. Thus, it was hard for me to believe that White people once did these things in Montgomery, and I was determined to visit this museum to see the photographic evidence of this with my own eyes. I intended to ask the employees of the Freedom Riders Museum in Montgomery a facetious question: who rides the Greyhound bus now? The Greyhound/Trailways bus station is now located in West Montgomery on South Boulevard in front of Taco Bell near the I-65 intersection. That is also the Bermuda Triangle where all the African-American crackheads, pimps, and prostitutes like to hang out. White people who live in Montgomery know better than to succumb to the temptation of cheap gasoline and stop at night at the Kangaroo gas station adjacent to the Greyhound Bus Station. If you stop there to fill up your tank with cheap regular unleaded, you will be reliably accosted by various types of scary African-American homeless people who might liberate your wallet. This small section of West Montgomery is hallowed ground to the Civil Rights Movement. Less than a mile in either direction of the new Greyhound/Trailways bus station, you will find Rosa Parks Avenue and the Selma-to-Montgomery National Historic Trail which runs up Mobile Highway. This is the seediest area of Montgomery which you have to travel through on US-82 on the way to Tuscaloosa. Rosa Parks Avenue and Mobile Highway are reliably blue lighted at night. A Google search for “Montgomery + Police + Sting” turns up all sorts of interesting people who sojourn into that area to celebrate the heritage of the Civil Rights Marytrs (CRM) like Yankee James Zwerg who bravely faced down a mob of angry Southern white supremacists to make the Greyhound Bus Station a BRA “no-go zone” for White people. In 1955, an African-American seamstress and NAACP activist named Rosa Parks bravely refused to give up her seat at the back of the bus. She went on to become the second most famous American in history. More American children can identify Martin Luther King, Rosa Parks, and Harriet Tubman than George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Abraham Lincoln. Clearly, Rosa Parks did something of unparalled historical importance to deserve this level of notoriety in the United States. George Washington led the Continental Army, Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, and Abraham Lincoln preserved the Union, but Rosa Parks integrated public transportation in Montgomery. In 2011, 83.6 percent of the people who ride the Montgomery Area Transit System (MATS) are African Americans, even though African-Americans are 54.5 percent of the population of Montgomery. Whites are 42.3 percent of Montgomery residents, but are only 12.7 percent of MATS riders. We also find that 62.9 percent of bus riders in Montgomery are female, 78.2 percent do not own a car, 23.9 percent are 25 to 34, and 53.1 percent make less than $10,000 a year. We know from The New York Times EBT card statistics that 32 percent of African-Americans in Montgomery County subsist on foodstamps. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the same African-Americans who get free groceries with their EBT cards, who live in subsidized housing paid for the government, whose healthcare is paid for by the government, where the welfare check arrives on “Da First of the Month,” are also the same people who almost exclusively ride public transportation in Montgomery. Rosa Parks deserves to be the second most famous American in history because of her great accomplishment which was ridding the buses in Montgomery of White taxpayers for welfare queens like Latonya and Shaniqua who live in the projects and dine on foodstamps could literally enjoy a free lunch and a free ride. Occidental Dissent looks forward to the day when stimulus package money can be used to retrofit the buses in Montgomery with sparkling new silver rims and sound systems so that the Northern tourists who visit to Montgomery can enjoy the authentic 365Black civil rights experience while cruising down Dexter Avenue to MLK’s church. Long live James Zwerg! Long live Rosa Parks! Long live Barack Hussein Obama! Long live Black Run America! Note: The strikethrough above is the solution to this particular problem. Watch the full episode. See more American Experience. Let My Criminals Go! California: The Color of Crime LOL, that white guy looks like Lee Harvey Oswald. Obviously both commies. where the welfare check arrives on “Da First of the Month,” are also the same people who almost exclusively ride public transportation in Montgomery. In California this day is known as “Mother’s Day.” The schools empty out as everyone hits the swap meets and WalMarts before all the good stuff is gone — or the gov’ment money is gone, whichever comes first! I used to attend a discussion group here in Dallas in which I was the only overtly racially conscious member. One evening during a break, as several of us were having a glass of wine and refreshments in the lobby of the old house where we met, a couple of younger women – teachers in their 30s – told about their field trip to Civil Rights shrines. They had done this as part of their coursework in a master’s degree program at Southern Methodist University (SMU). Such academic pilgrimages are very popular now, I understand. Anyway, they visited Montgomery, Selma and Atlanta and after telling us about that they talked about their favorite Civil Rights “heroes.” I then told the group about my own Civil Rights pilgrimage of 1964, when my family and I had visited Lester Maddox at his Pickrick Cafeteria in Atlanta. Lester – a small but feisty man – had become notorious for chasing would-be “integraters” out of his restaurant with an axe handle. After the authorities made him close his cafeteria because he refused to comply with the Civil Rights Act, he reopened as a store, selling “Pickrick Drumsticks,” axe handles commemorating his defiance. My brother and I each bought one. I still have mine. Unfortunately, the other folks at the discussion group (a typical assortment of guilty white liberals) did not seem to appreciate my story. The reason I’m bringing it up here is to remind you that there was and is another side to what happened during “the Struggle,” and we need to do a better job of defending the Southern whites of that era from the calumny which is now routinely directed against them. We can have our own heroes – Lester Maddox is certainly one of mine – and we shouldn’t be shy in talking about them to others, including dewy eyed school teachers who know only the approved version of what happened back then. Why do people use the term “civil rights movement”? The term “civil rights movement” doesn’t describe what it acturally was- it was an ethnically and racially motivated movement of black people, led and financed largely by Jews. The so-called “civil rights leaders” didn’t care about the civil rights of Celtic Americans in the South. In my Southern state capital we have a massive network of buses and trolleys. A recently built transfer station, complete with a $35k statue of a local “civil rights” leader, highlights this billion dollar system. One day I and another white person decided to ride the bus to work downtown from our mostly white, burbs neighborhood. The bus was 10 minutes late, then 20, then 30 minutes. As we walked back to our houses and got in our cars to leave, a last minute call to the city bus authority revealed that, “We had a breakdown and only gots so many buses fo yo route”. I couldn’t help it and asked how many people does she think were late for their jobs that day, “We don’t got many people riding de buses in your neighborhood.” By golly after some research she was right. And the people that rode the buses, from my unscientific survey, seemed to be about 95% black. And no white people that could afford a car should try this experiment with out understanding the risks. Unless you’re prepared to go Epic Beard Man on their nappy heads you should stay clear of public transportation. I’ve only recently come to see the Civil Rights Movement for what it was–the marginalization of white southern men. They could really give a hoot about raising up the black man, what they wanted was to tear down the white man and, of course, give blacks unfettered access to white girls and women. Here’s my argument to civil rights nuts: if southern whites were so damned evil, why would blacks want to live around them at all? Why didn’t the rich Yankee do-gooders buy out the blacks and move them all to the North? Or why didn’t they build their own towns and schools in a segregated south? Do you not think the Chinese would have done that? No, the point was to destroy the white man, plain and simple. This is the scariest “blog” I have stumbled upon to date — you people could not be more ignorant if you tried. Some of the comments posted to this thread have made me stop to check and double-check the date they were posted… but then I suppose you’re all proud to be continuing the legacy of racism. Thank goodness you’re all tucked far away in the boonies and those of us who are educated, decent human beings are in charge. I always wonder why we didn’t just let you secede… Liz, y’all didn’t let us secede because you needed someone who would serve in the military to protect your precious rights, among other things. Thank god for your comment Liz, I was starting to feel so disgusted it was making me sick. I have NO desire to visit the southern states simply because of the remnants of racism that lurk there, I agree that the white southern man is probably one of the most detrimental beings left on this planet and needs to be destroyed if these are the beliefs some of you have. I am not as ignorant as you lot though, and will not paint all southern white men with the same brush, but I feel sorry for the ones who are enlightened if they have to deal with your hate mongering asses on a regular basis. OH and for you information, us white women can choose whoever the hell we want, “destroying the white man” has nothing to do with whom we choose to love. Now do everyone else in the world a favor and shut up before someone smarter then you shuts you up. Comments are closed.

"AUSTIN — Despite Gov. Rick Perry's renewed call for its passage, legislation banning ""sanctuary cities"" appeared dead in the Senate, where 12 Democrats pledged to block consideration of the bill until past Wednesday's midnight deadline for House bills. The legislation, passed by the House, would have banned local governments from creating ""sanctuaries' for illegal immigrants by prohibiting law enforcement officers from inquiring into the immigration status of individuals they detain. Perry, who accused Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bill White of turning Houston into a sanctuary city during his tenure as mayor, made passage of the legislation one of his priorities. On Wednesday, Perry said he would leave the issue to the Legislature but added, ""it's a very important piece of legislation"" that ""people in the state of Texas want to see addressed."" House Bill 12 has been fought by Democrats, who say it will lead to racial profiling by police of Hispanics. They also point out that many police chiefs testified against the bill, saying it would take time away from local law enforcement duties to fill in as federal immigration officers. On Wednesday evening, state Sen. Dan Patrick, R-Houston, said he hoped the bill would be revived. ""I don't think we're ready to give up,"" he said. ""All of the governor's other emergency measures have passed but this one."" While the Senate rules allow for a simple majority to debate House bills on Wednesday, House Bill 12 would require a vote of two-thirds of the Senate if it is brought up out of order on the list of bills on the Senate's agenda. Sen. Kirk Watson, D-Austin, a stalwart opponent of the sanctuary city bill, has a bill ahead of House Bill 12 on the calendar. Until Watson agrees to debate his bill, House Bill 12 would require a vote of two-thirds of the Senate to take it out of order. Watson declined to comment on his intentions, but it appeared unlikely he would pass his bill and allow the sanctuary city debate to go forward. Lawmakers declined to predict whether an effort would be made to attach the proposal to another bill. Earlier Wednesday, Perry hit on one of his favorite themes — inaction by Washington, D.C. - which he cited as a need for the sanctuary cities bill. ""It goes back to the whole issue of border security. The members of the Legislature would probably stand here and tell you they'd just as soon not have to be dealing with this issue … but because the failure of Washington, D.C,, from the standpoint of securing our border, there are individuals who are coming into Texas who are illegally penetrating into this country,""he said. ""We need to give our law enforcement some flexibility, that's what this bill does. It gives them the flexibility to be able to just ask some appropriate and routine questions of those individuals during a lawful stop."" Asked whether there may be a special session on that issue, he said, ""I think it's way too premature to be even discussing special sessions"" Reporter Peggy Fikac contributed to this report. patti.hart@.com"

"Updated | WASHINGTON — A Supreme Court decision upholding an Arizona law penalizing businesses that hire illegal immigrants could spur other states to try similar measures aimed at stopping people from crossing the border illegally. By Denny Gainer, USA TODAY file The Supreme Court upheld an Arizona law that targets businesses who hire illegal immigrants. By Denny Gainer, USA TODAY file The Supreme Court upheld an Arizona law that targets businesses who hire illegal immigrants. In their 5-3 decision Thursday, the justices made clear that states can play a role in what is generally a federal system of immigration regulation. The court upheld a 2007 Arizona law that revokes the business license of companies that hire unauthorized workers, saying it met an exception to the usual federal prohibition on states setting civil or criminal penalties in this area. The court, however, offered no clear signal of how it might rule on a more controversial and closely watched Arizona anti-immigration law, signed in 2010 by Republican Gov. Jan Brewer and now facing a separate, higher-profile legal challenge. That law, often referred to as Arizona SB 1070, requires police to investigate the status of anyone an arresting officer suspects might be here illegally. The Obama administration and other critics say it could lead to racial profiling. Federal courts have blocked enforcement of that provision while litigation is pending; Brewer says the state will appeal the injunction to the high court this summer. While national attention has focused on that sweeping law targeting individuals, Thursday's case related to employers is significant for its endorsement of a state effort to crack down on illegal workers. The court ""gives the green light to state use of licensing laws as a tool of immigration enforcement,"" says Temple University law professor Peter Spiro, predicting that advocates for restrictions will likely push other states to adopt measures similar to Arizona. ""But that doesn't mean they will get their way,"" added Spiro, who specializes in immigration law. ""Business interests are very powerful in state capitals."" Jay Sekulow, chief counsel at the American Center for Law and Justice, among the groups that backed Arizona at the court, said, ""I think you're going to see this become a catalyst for state action, in licensing and other areas."" He termed the ruling ""a road map"" for states that want ""to protect their borders and citizens."" The Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) also said it hoped state legislatures would move on new restrictions. Omar Jadwat, an immigration rights lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, which took the lead with the Chamber of Commerce in suing Arizona, expressed regret about the ruling but stressed its narrowness and said it would not affect resolution of the dispute over SB 1070. Civil rights and business groups had argued that the Arizona law clashes with comprehensive U.S. immigration policy and, in a practical vein, burdens lawful employers and could lead to discrimination based on race and national origin. Lawyer Carter Phillips, who represented the challengers, told the justices during arguments in December that Congress feared that if employers faced heavy penalties, they would ""err on the side of not hiring"" people who looked foreign but were authorized to work here. The key question was whether the Arizona penalty was overridden by federal immigration rules that bar ""any state or local law imposing civil or criminal sanctions (other than through licensing and similar laws) upon those who employ"" illegal immigrants. In his opinion for the court, Chief Justice John Roberts said the sanction is permitted under the ""licensing"" exemption. He stressed that the Arizona law covers only ""knowing or intentional violations"" of the U.S. prohibition on hiring illegal workers and that the penalty is triggered only after the second violation. ""An employer acting in good faith need have no fear of the sanctions,"" Roberts wrote. The court in Chamber of Commerce v. Whiting also upheld an Arizona provision requiring all employers in the state to use a federal electronic verification system to confirm that workers are authorized to take jobs. The federal government makes that E-verify system optional, and challengers said the records are incomplete and prone to error. Roberts was joined by Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, Samuel Alito and, for most of his opinion, Clarence Thomas. Dissenting were Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor. The court's ninth justice, Elena Kagan, who previously was U.S. solicitor general, did not participate. The U.S. government had sided with the challengers, saying the state's law was not truly a ""licensing"" provision because it did not involve the granting of licenses, only the revocation. Roberts noted in his opinion that at least eight other states, including Colorado, Mississippi and Pennsylvania, have followed Arizona with laws attempting to impose sanctions for the hiring of illegal workers. Dissenting justices said the federal system was intended to prevent such a patchwork of state laws and said the majority too broadly construed the licensing exception. Justice Breyer, in a dissenting opinion joined by Ginsburg, wrote that state penalties ""might prove more effective in stopping the hiring of unauthorized aliens. But they are unlikely to do so consistent with Congress' other critically important goals, in particular, Congress' efforts to protect from discrimination legal workers who look or sound foreign.""

" and test them all, and keep the ones that are more accurate than others. Not absolutely accurate, because almost nothing is if anything, but more accurate because itâ€™s an ongoing process. With each iteration, kick the good upstairs and forget about the bad. That’s the face of true collaboration because it has a goal in mind for everyone: a healthy society. To that end, it’s willing to be good to some and kick out others. Every society, to some degree, is willing to do this, even if it’s a very “progressive” society that locks murderers and pedophiles up in glorified daycare centers. […] Collaborative societies tend to therefore operate on the principle of self-interest first, as a means of defining the individual and seeing what he or she is capable of, and then secondarily, helping others. This is to avoid the reversed justification where someone who fails at other things makes themselves a Christ-like figure who dedicates their life to fighting poverty, misery or some other unsurmountable goal — it’s cognitive dissonance: they could not succeed, so found a surrogate goal, and are using it to justify their success as an individual. – “The Psychology of Leftism” A sensible starting point for future politics is to remove universal enfranchisement and replace it with vote by land-owning heads of households, or others who are in positions of responsibility. We should not allow those who do not understand responsibility and generally resent it to vote alongside those who put their lives on the line to get things done. Remove subsidies of the dysfunctional. Our society likes to spawn an Idiocracy within it because that produces compliant, oblivious, easily-suggestible voters. My inner conservatism awakened. It was a basic realization: first, the causes of our misfortune are not external, generally. They’re internal: drink too much, and you fail at life. If you can’t do your job without being reminded of basic details, you’ll work at Mickey D’s forever. If you are responsible, organized and apply yourself, you rise. In fact, the only substantive bias I saw was people biased against themselves, which is very common. Still all my friends were liberal. We drove past a ghetto — white, black or other — and they saw people who were victims of an education system that was bad, or a corporate conspiracy, or whatever it is in poverty that “makes” people drink. I’d point out that these people went to the same schools the rest of us did, in which if you learned a few basic things or scored well on a standardized test, they tried their hardest to help you. I’d point out that if these folks had any aptitude in getting grades or scoring on standardized tests, they could go to a wide range of universities that were specifically looking for impoverished or minority students. Then I’d point out the obvious inconsistencies: vast consumption of expensive alcohol and cigarettes, expensive cars next to hovels, obvious disarray and lack of maintenance, and so on. My friends wouldn’t hear it. – “Area 51” By replacing a welfare state with job insurance, and replacing entitlements with benefits cost-discounted through bulk purchase, we can stop subsidizing the incompetent, dysfunctional and disorganized. Subsidize the highly functional to overbreed. A nation is its people; its people, far from being equal citizens that spring out of the same mold and then get painted differently, vary in ability. We should encourage the best to overbreed, or have extra children, by subsidizing those extra children in medicine and education. Decline starts with loss of consensus. When you have social consensus about what is valued, you can reward people for upholding that and thus create a constant stream of “better” people. What replaces that is a measurement of a person’s viability to business or popularity (media), which is not a measurement of their overall competence but their skill/determination at only one skill out of thousands. Without a values system, society rewards the outlandish, the corrupt, the conniving and the dramatic. It rewards those who play the social game, not those who can create better function. This is why in third world nations, people are generally more verbally and socially competent than they are competent with technologies and learning. They can talk a good game, or really make something sound like an appealing product; are they the descendants of long-ago corrupted hipsters? Hipsters themselves are the most evident product of decline. When your middle class kids stop trying to do anything productive and become egomaniacs trying to prove how unique they are, you know the system is broken, has failed them and has failed itself. – “What will split America” This means that instead of concentrating our future population on the lower end of the voting pool, we aim toward the higher. Union between practical and aspiration Politics is a tool; tools exist to (in the right hands) help people; by people we mean not just individuals, but whole civilizations, which represent people united around ideas (New Righters call this meta-politics, or how culture and ideas shift politics to support them). Our ideas are straightforward: nationalism is the best order for a society; diversity doesn’t work. Even more, there are biological differences not only between races, but social castes and classes, and ethnies as well as individuals. Human biological diversity is more complex than superior/inferior. Clyburn, who met his wife at a 1960 court hearing after spending a night in jail for having engaged in a civil rights protest in Orangeburg, S.C., then brought up Obama’s race as the first black president. “You know, I’m 70 years old,” he said. “And I can tell you; people don’t like to deal with it, but the fact of the matter is, the president’s problems are in large measure because of the color of his skin.” Clyburn noted that he himself got hate mail, racist phone calls and offensive faxes on a regular basis. Asked how that relates to the president, Clyburn retorted: “We have the same skin color; that’s how it relates to him.” – McClatchy We need to create a society that unites people toward a goal, and then gradually improves the quality of individuals so we do not need centralized control and police on every street corner. The only rational starting point for this is culture, which is embedded in race/ethny and vice-versa. Heritage, culture, language, customs and values exist in parallel with the same center, which is a national population, and this is what nationalists defend. Racism, hatred, anger, anti-Semitism, paranoia and other angry low self-esteem teenager behaviors are simply not needed, or in technical terms, obsolete. The point of a healthy society is to unite the practical and the beautiful. You imagine a future you want and work toward it; it’s not just a matter of, in true reactionary fashion, adapting to what exists now. You must also plan what you desire, and the best vector for that is culture. The future awaits if we cast aside the failed and reach out for the more ambitious but actually beautiful. All of this begins with the end of white nationalism. What is presented here is a plausible future that lies within our grasp. However, white nationalism stands in our way. If we remove it, we can build something better and by not being pointlessly alienated and unrealistic, be responsible enough to deserve power and the trust of our fellow citizens. To most on the political spectrum farther right than moderate Republicans, this seems like heresy. “But we get 100,000 people a day here through our angry genocidal forum! You can’t turn down numbers like that!” — sure we can, especially when you consider that ten million a day investigate mainstream conservative information. It’s modern society: any chirping cheeseball can put forth a notion, detach it from reality and get a few hundred thousand people discussing it. They do this quite successfully for trivial things like rock bands, TV shows, favorite products and even dumb trends like putting bacon in ice cream. In other words, that we have a few hundred thousand warm bodies pounding on their keyboards in unison about some idea proves nothing. If anything, it’s a useful moneymaker for our adversaries, whoâ€™d just love an organized uprising of Hollywood-style totalitarianism. The donations would keep rolling in at a snappy pace, then. But on the other hand, all good things start small. Every giant tree was once a seedling that for a long time looked just like any other weed. The Puritans who founded America were probably considered the 16th century equivalent of potheads home in England: “Right, religious liberty. Good luck with that. Don’t eat too much when you get the munchies.” However, for any cultural shift to succeed — and in a time when politics responds to trends both illusory and realistic, the only change that happens is a cultural shift in attitudes and expectations, and politics follows that — it must be distilled down into a clear, simple and easily-transferred message. A meme, if you will. – “Resisting Assimilation” As is normal in a civilization that is collapsing from within, all of our words have become mis-defined for the political convenience of our rulers. Even more, most of our institutions, including the underground ones, are corrupt. Instead of trying to work with such broken objects, we should start anew and make something with a hope of survival. Tags: anti-diversity, nationalism, racial realism, racialism, racism, white nationalism, white supremacy by Brett Stevens on May 26, 2011 If we want a saner world, those of us who understand why white nationalism is important need to destroy white nationalism. No, seriously: throw it on a bonfire, pour gasoline on it, and watch it burn from a distance. Destroy white nationalism before it’s too late. White nationalism is what we call a surrogate, or a fake thing that stands in for what you need. It wastes your time and, because it claims to solve your problem, prevents you from finding the real solution. Although this is unpopular — like everything I write for all four of you to enjoy — my viewpoint remains that we need a revitalized mainstream conservatism. Only that will solve our actual problem. Let’s look at the logic: If you care about the issues white nationalism discusses, the last thing you should do is endorse white nationalists. There are better ways; even more, there are ways which do not outright fail as white nationalism does. You probably don’t want your hopes to fail, do you? White nationalism is a failure. If political movements are each a type of person, white nationalism is an underconfident teenager. White nationalism sulks in its bedroom, takes its toys and goes home, refuses to play nicely with the other kids, passive-aggressively throws spitwads at the African-American kids and takes candy from the Jewish kids (at least until it needs a doctor or lawyer). Even worse things happened in underground conservatism: The vanguardist is a peculiar species of White Nationalist with a range that extends across cyberspace. This political animal has a number of discernible, trademark characteristics. Specifically, a “vanguardist” is someone who believes: (1) Conservatives are worthless. (2) Ordinary people are lemmings. (3) Worse is better. (4) The system is broken. (5) A collapse is coming. (6) They will benefit from this collapse. (7) A massive Jewish conspiracy is responsible for their plight. (8) Revolution is the only solution. Instead of engaging the cultural and political mainstream, a vanguardist is someone who favors withdrawing from the system, sealing themselves off in enclaves, and organizing around a dynamic leader. – Why Vanguardists Can’t Win, by Hunter Wallace Vanguardists have a point: mainstream conservatives flee the room when issues like diversity, race, sexual liberation and pre-emptive geopolitics enter the discussion. However, vanguardists need to realize that the reasons conservatives flee now versus the reasons for their flight in 1968 are different. In 1968, they didn’t want to be put on the losing side of a cultural war guaranteed by the flood of Baby Boomer children, who having been raised by two working parents during the WWII and recovery years, were naturally a neurotic mess, and so turned liberal en masse. Right now, the reason mainstream conservatives won’t touch racial issues (for example) is because vanguardists exist — and instead of beating back the left who call any critic of total anarchy a racist, the vanguardists are fulfilling the stereotypes of Hollywood movies of angry, violent racists who have no real political plan or solutions to the breadth of problems that we face. – “Forward” Unable to clearly state what it wants, it complains emotionally about what it does not want and then when people attempt to take it seriously, proclaims “You just don’t understand me!” and runs into its room slamming the door. It doesn’t address the whole question. We all know diversity is a failure. If diversity was a success, all the nice white liberals would have moved to multiracial neighborhoods. Instead, when given a chance and especially after they have children, they flock to the tightey whitey suburbs and talk a lot about how “interesting” their Japanese neighbors are. Finally, in the 1960s, the left found its ultimate weapon: race. Bring in non-majority people, or enfranchise existing ones, and they will always vote against the majority. Conservatives had a chance to oppose this but bungled it, missed the boat, or opted for an easier fight. Now their country has changed and has a huge population that not only will always vote against them, but increasingly demands more federal aid. – “White Secession” Ninety percent of the liberals I know live in places where the only black faces are working on the lawn. But beyond knowing that diversity is a failure, what does white nationalism want? I mean aside from sociopathic fantasies of Holocaust II, that is. crickets That’s correct: other than the name, which tells you that white nationalists want an ethnostate of only white people, there is no further content to white nationalism. Where do they stand on defense spending? Who knows — there’s no organized theory behind white nationalism. Other than not spending defense dollars on black-owned weapons, I guess. White nationalism has failed. Mainstream conservatism has failed by not integrating the sane parts of white nationalism into its platform. This unity will only occur when we make these philosophies grow up, and answer the difficult questions (instead of the easy, dogma-laden ones) in order to find a better future for ourselves. – “A tale of two cities” Indulges in psychotic and ineffective behaviors. I will always be an ardent nationalist. What I don’t like is fake nationalism, especially if it carries with it the burden of supporting illogical positions like emotional outbursts of racial hatred and paranoid anti-Semitism. It’s not the kids at the top of the hierarchy — well-adjusted white people — who are bullying others. It’s those who want to replace them. They are using the unpopularity of people lower on the totem pole to raise themselves higher, through cruelty. And at the top of this group are the people crying “racist” who need to be better than those toothless uneducated country folk. To raise your own social status, nothing works better than by using relative motion. No matter how ignorant someone thinks you are, if you can find someone more ignorant that person becomes the focus, and you rise. The instant you designate someone as a target, especially for “good” reasons e.g. that they are elitist or racist, everyone else in the room unites against them. – “Racist? We’re not; multiculturalism is” I wouldn’t recommend those psychological burdens to my worst enemies, let alone those who want to be working with me. “Hi, would you like a nice hot steaming cup of socially-alienating futility?” Encourages a cult-like mindset. White nationalism has a binary view of the world: you are either with us, or with them. As a result, you cannot have a normal life once you touch white nationalism. What we have here, then, is a group of people claiming that all whites should be equal and should join together to commit racial holy war against non-whites, thus delivering us to a society that is a mirror image of our current one except that it is all “white,” including the mixed tribes mentioned above. Further, those who are involved in the quest wish to dominate this new society, and to exclude or execute those who have collaborated with the current society, much like revolutionaries have in the past. It is a revolutionary movement, not a constructive one; it wishes to tear down a hierarchy and replace it with a worker’s paradise, even if all the workers are ostensibly “white.â” In short, it is racial Marxism, and it will prove as destructive to the Indo-European tribes as capitalist multiculturalism has. This is the reason it does not appeal to the Silent Majority: it would end their ability to separate themselves from the “base” rabble and achieve greater heights, therefore, White Nationalism is not the one roll of the dice we should take when reforming our society. Among thinking people of course there is no question that our society should be reformed, and more radically than any White Nationalist has so far suggested. Our values became fundamentally rotted to the point where the first mass revolt could occur, and since then, we have been degenerating as a population even without the influence of other races. We are breeding people to have jobs, buy hot food, and then eat it watching television. Divorce rates are sky-high, drug abuse is rampant, STDs are skyrocketing, pollution increases yearly, our climate is shattered, we die of cancers at incredible rates, depression is on the rise in all industrialized countries, we spend increasing amounts of time manipulating a system that was supposed to be working for us, our leaders are cynical predators who use the image of truth to disguise a personal profit agenda; we are declining into a third-world state without the intervention of any other races, and while multiculturalism is a symbol of this and a failure of an ideology in itself, it is not the cause. The cause is within. We cannot blame others; we have to look within. And when we’ve found the cause, argue Silent Majority types, instead of screaming for vegeance we should find a long-term solution to the problem. Since that involves replacing economic-driven modern society with something that lives for values itself, and is a reversal of the steady decline of the last thousand years, it’s no small order. Not only is White Nationalism not up to task, Silent Majority types argue, but by the nature of its Marxist roots it will interrupt the healing process that is needed. – “Lock up all the neo-Nazis” Instead, you must measure yourself in terms of how well you fulfill the white nationalist dogma. Supplants real nationalist movements. If I wanted to start a nationalist group tomorrow, what would happen — specifically, if that nationalist group surpassed all the current white nationalist ones? I wish someone would test this theory by creating a pro-White website with these dealbreakers in mind: exclude the HBD nerds who glorify Asian women, the negative curmudgeons, the “all is losters,” the creepy weirdos, the embittered misogynists, the effete homosexual intellectuals, and the Neo-Nazi atheists on a jihad against Christianity. The website would need a good editor that would balance political discussion with a hefty complement of articles about culture, religion, and family. There would also have to be more talk about ethnicity and pocketbook issues. I would bet money that would solve the problem. In fact, I predict that racially conscious women would start coming out of the woodwork because women are more social than men and would be attracted like moths to a flame to other women who share their views and who are potential friends. – OD Answer: white nationalists would fight it tooth and nail. It would replace them and their comfortable clubhouse, therefore even if it was more likely to achieve the goals white nationalists hold dear, they would destroy it. Misdiagnoses the problem. White nationalists tend to be racists, not nationalists. Nationalists believe in ethnic self-rule. One ethnic group, one nation; it defines its own standards through culture, language, customs, heritage and values. No form of diversity works. Too much variation — Haidt estimates it at 20% and up — and a society falls apart, whether that variation is basic philosophy, basic values, religion, social class, genetic caste, race or ethnicity. It doesn’t work because without social accord, you have a pluralism in which each group competes with all others for predominance, and so manipulation becomes the standard â€” as does a victim/oppressor mentality. Even mixing groups of the same race does not work. “White” people are highly varied between Southern, Eastern, Western and UK/US populations. In the large multicultural American cities, white outliers like Polish, Italian, Greek, Russian and Irish tend to cluster with their own, rather than integrate into the Anglo-German mainstream. It’s not really much different from how North Asians segregate themselves. – What comes after liberalism? Racism is some sort of perverse desire to declare others as beneath you so that you can feel better about yourself. It is not limited to white nationalists; the entire left hates racially-aware white people as a means of feeling better than them. Obstructs correct diagnosis and action. The disaster of white nationalism is like a lonely night when you answer the phone, and it’s a wrong number and the other party thinks they have phoned a pizza delivery place. In a surly mood, you take their order, hang up, and leave them without a pizza. So long as white nationalism exists, we’re not going to get responsible and effective nationalist movements, because no one with any future outside of the basement is going to touch white nationalism with a ten-foot pole. We can finally say what’s on many people’s minds, which is that leftist politics, television commercials, hipsters and polite lies have more in common than not. We need to hit people over the head with the idea that our individualistic “freedom” and “democracy” are not manipulated by commerce, but are its children. A society based on individual desires becomes a giant open-air bazaar with no standards, and eventually, it collapses. The reason the right-wing is hard to define, politically, is that right-wingness is not politics. It’s a whole vision, a vision of a society of a type opposite the liberal democratic, yet predating it. It cannot be broken down into lifestyle, politics, economics, and religion, yet it contains all of these. Unlike liberalism, which is an idea of fragmenting the existing, conservatism is a whole idea. For that reason, conservatism is incompatible with modern politics, which are based in liberalism and its triumph, liberal democracy. – “Outrage!” Why does the American FBI so freely scatter millions of dollars among its far-right informants? First, because they’re terrified of another Tim McVeigh; second, because by funding the pretend Reich of the useless, they ensure that no one with any brains will publicly support white nationalism. Sure, they can handle a few Jared Taylors, Kevin MacDonalds, Peter Brimelows, Steve Sailers, Bill Whites and Billy Ropers, but they’d prefer that no one new comes to the table. They want to make sure nationalism stays taboo, and the best way to do that is to subsidize insane “nationalists.” We need a vital movement. Instead of the failure that is white nationalism, we need a nationalist movement with a chance of success. In the suburbs and countryside, you need an actual community and people who are whole members of that community. If your handyman is also dangerously unstable, that’s a problem; on the flip side, if your handyman is good but a bit of an alcoholic, you’re less likely to be put off like a buyer seeing a dent in a new car. This sense of community is what separates country from city. The city is transactional, without memory or any awareness of the effects of its action; the country (and burbs, which are half-country but might as well be all country because the people who move there are fleeing the city) is about observing the effects of your actions, and planning carefully. – “A nation divided” Ideally, it would argue for nationalism in the abstract; that way, all peoples can have nationalism, and each group will work to help get the same rights for everyone, so they can have them as well. Addresses the whole question. While race may be a cornerstone of politics, it is not the only cornerstone. Even in an all-Swedish society, political issues arise beyond race. For this reason, any nationalist movement also needs a political platform and values system. Many want this to be leftist, socialist, anarchist or even Marxist; however, those belief systems are based on the individual as separate from the tribe, nation and culture. That is the exact opposite of what any nationalist movement will believe. The left and right cannot agree, and do not constitute a center. Constant debate, while we are trained to think it is “refreshing” and “keeping our options open,” is in fact a giant ruse to keep us from ever having a center. This keeps us on hold while the process grinds on, never finding an answer, and thus leaving us in convenient anarchy — which benefits rapacious individuals and businesses most of all, good people the least. There is no reconciling these two. If you want to sabotage a government, make sure its job is to make both groups happy. If you’re really hell-bent on getting nothing done, make sure you trade off parties every four years. Then government will become inert, which if you fear its control by the other party, may be your ideal. – “Identity” For this reason, any future nationalist movement will be conservative at its core, although it should choose to modify conservatism to avoid the calcified, hide-bound reactionarism that mars so many conservative movements. Diagnoses spiritual decay at core. For a civilization like the West to collapse, it needs to lose its organizing principle or consensus. This happens on the most basic level of a civilization, which is its collective will to live. Encourages participation by normal healthy people. While intellectuals like to think that they and the proletariat are the prime movers in politics, the real force is the center: the educated but not bookish middle class who work the jobs that require knowing something about how the system works. These are teachers, police officers, firefighters, lawyers, doctors, architects, entrepreneurs, managers, and specialists. Without the participation of these, any movement ends up marginalized. Like women, this demographic group responds to its interests: family-oriented values for raising healthy kids, safe neighborhoods, economic growth and political stability. Brings nationalism back into public discourse. It has been convenient for too long for the left to simply cry “That’s racist!” whenever something it dislikes shows up. Unfortunately, then our big media masters can draw aside the screen and oh look, there are white nationalists, honey. They want to — what is it again, WNs? — oh right, they want to exterminate all the Jews and African-Americans. Guess the talking heads were right: you’d have to be crazy to be a nationalist. Coulter puts it mildly. Diversity is a cancer. The problem isn’t blacks, or whites, or Jews, or gentiles. It’s diversity. It’s a stupid idea to group different things together and force them, through benevolent moral authoritarian states, to “just all get along.” They cannot all get along. To do so would require they compromise the cultures, values and heritages that make them unique. Modern liberals are caught in the illusion that “us all getting along” is the highest good. That way, the lion lies down with the lamb and so on. But the cost of that getting along is that we lose who we are. We lose culture. We lose religion. We lose heritage. And what’s left? A Nanny State government, shopping malls and lots of TV, of course! You can’t blame Jews for wanting to avoid that fate. If the gentiles are so cow-stupid that they elect to destroy their own culture through an ethic of convenience, well, it’s not Jews’ problem or fault. But if one is a Jew who likes one’s heritage and culture, it’s important not to follow that example. – “Helen Thomas and the case for Israel” And if a sane nationalist movement arose? Acts honorably and competently toward its ends. The politics that will supersede the rancid politics of this time will do so not by being demagogues, like the left, or fear-mongers like the right, but by being practical and keeping government minimal by keeping political drama minimal. True, all the people with nothing better to do love the political drama, so it’s easy to whip up an army; however, these people do not represent the middle of our society, and that middle knows it. A political organization that will inherit the future will do so by behaving like someone we can trust. Honorable behavior that achieves its ends, and not one side or the other, will distinguish this group. How to get there. Right now we’re very far from our goal, and yet so close. In fact, with the ongoing failures of liberal society people are beating a path to our door as nationalists, but have no intention of joining up with us as long as we partner with these mentally defective white nationalist types. Now that they’re seeing that “diversity” has gone from “tolerate others living in our country” to “every subdivision must be diverse, speech codes must be enforced, and those who do not obey are called racists,” the white majority is fighting back. Their message is simple: we want to change the laws so we can get the Nanny State off our back and continue to live as we have been, without having to subsidize others. Liberals will never understand this, but in conservative ideology, you don’t subsidize other people — in part because it’s condescending, but in part because it ruins the work ethic of your nation. That’s what all the rambling about “socialism” is about: we want to preserve our values, including work ethic. – “Race: The Ultimate Taboo” After all, white nationalists appear to be a group of angry misfits without a plan except destruction, and no sane person is going to sign up for that. Even more, their cult-like attitude means that they destroy anyone with a good idea — burn that witch doctor! — who might rise above the mob. Our future path consists of recognizing that white nationalists are the obstruction on our path to power, and we must remove them by replacing them with an effective and coherent movement that can then un-do the damages of leftism and in the process, solidify its own power base. Destroy white nationalism. For nationalism to succeed, white nationalism must be destroyed. Almost all nationalist leaders will oppose this. For them, it’s a risky prospect to leave behind the diehards and standbys, even if those are such alienated psychopaths that they drive away normal people. Yet this is what must be done. White nationalism to an outsider resembles a trailer park full of drunks, criminals, burn-outs and embittered failures. Even worse, it is ruled prison-style by thuggish loudmouths who insist on the most insane dogma as a type of loyalty test. White nationalists like to tell us they are the only alternative for nationalism. If they’re right, however, nationalism is doomed to occupy a tiny segment of society populated by its least organized and effective people. If that is true, nationalism will get nowhere. This is why white nationalists, FBI agents, and anti-nationalists all agree that the current white nationalism underground is exactly what should be there. Adopt mainstream conservatism. Although many current nationalists seem to fear this, adopting mainstream conservatism is the solution for nationalism. Not only does it avoid the excesses of white nationalism, but it already has a structure in place for addressing politics beyond race. Both groups are waiting for this great awakening when people discover the outrage, and proclaim that the right was correct all along, and even more, that many of modern society’s enemies and detractors were also right. They think that the only reason outrage has not triumphed is that people are apathetic. There’s a simpler explanation: the right isn’t ready to rule, isn’t organized and is dyfunctional. Before we can aspire to rule, we need to clean our house: Without the above, the right-wing stands no chance of winning power. Like the left-wing is a spectrum anarchy to Communism with liberal democracy in the middle, the right-wing is a spectrum from aristocracy to National Socialism with paleoconservatism in the middle. Political wings tend toward their middles and, if successful in that, gradually move toward extremes. Unless they screw it up, the right is a clear winner because they tackle the one big problem — the elephant in the room — that few are willing to recognize, much less discuss: our civilization is in decay and, other than our technology, we are producing nothing of worth and are boring ourselves with our increasingly shallow amusements. This is how empires end. – “Outrage!” And unlike many of the left-leaning European nationalist movements like the New Right, it has a practical attitude toward adoption of American hegemony and other factors that most people in the middle agree have been stabilizing. Introduce paleoconservative elements. Once a mainstream platform has been adopted, paleoconservative elements including nationalism (definition) can slowly be integrated. WND, an American mainstream conservative organization, wants me to be outraged by Eboo Patel’s statement. I am not outraged; I think he’s right. Per the norm for liberals, he told you half the story. He represents a totalitarian government that wants to rule by thought control through social guilt. On the other hand, traditional religious governments want to rule through a type of ideal, which is a form of identity. It matters whether it’s Islamic or Christian, but the type of society they desire is the same. Greens, national socialists, and deontological moralists all fall into this camp as well. Many of us want a civilization based around an ideal: We are denied this type of civilization by another civilization type, which is the society of no center. All of these are the same: chaotic, lowest common denominator, anarchistic life in the streets, a powerful government with a powerful dogma verging toward the left, and behind the scenes, a vast web of corruption and payoffs and oligarchs who actually make things happen, invisibly. All civilizations with a center naturally find compatibility between that ideal and the various areas it could manifest, like identity, values, philosophy, theology and heritage — a genetic record of not just geography, but cultural values in the past — because all interpretations converge on its core ideal, or center. This means that for a civilization with a center, nothing is guesswork. You know what behaviors will be rewarded, and what will not, even in ambiguous situations. Even more, it provides a firmer “glue” that keeps the group bonded to you as an individual: not “we must support him, because he’s equal” but “we want to support him because he’s a good guy defending the values all of us cherish.” – “Identity” After all, racial unity with culture has been the dominant order for most of history: Boris’s point that racial tribalism did not exist before the modern era is not correct. This tribalism did not express itself as “white nationalism” or even as “white” as it was often bound up with ethnic and religious identity. But the people of Europe and the ancient world were highly conscious of race and saw it as a determing aspect of life. Again, they usually saw it as intertwined with other aspects of identity, such as tribe, clan, ethnicity, religion and class. Virgil’s Aeneid is a story of racial consciousness, as Aeneas sets out from the ruins of Troy to found a new nation, which will be the basis for an entire civilization. This new civilization is not to be based on ideas in Virgil’s conception of it (a vision which was embraced by Romans and Europeans for many hundreds of years in their almost fanatical devotion to this tale), but racial and tribal identity. Aeneas does not stay in Carthage, despite the temptation to do so. His people and his ultimate destiny are not there. The ancients and later Europeans did not intermarry or form integrated communities with other races despite extensive mixing with the peoples of Asia and Africa. It is not correct to say they were bound in place because of lack of transportation. Goods were exchanged with Asia and Africa and there was ample opportunity for intermixing if it was desired. The white race also has for many hundreds of years had an overriding transcendent aspect to its collective identity in the form of Christianity. I am confused by Boris’s point that we cannot treat the white race as “an objectively fixed entity.” It is treated as an objectively fixed entity every hour of the day. It is a determining factor in where we live, what jobs we get, what colleges we get into, what scholarships we receive, whom we marry and where we send our children to school. Whites may not perceive the white race as “an objectively fixed entity,” but others do. – The Thinking Housewife If this is done without racial hatred, but from a simple practical perspective (“diversity doesn’t work; nationalism does”) it has a good chance of succeeding. If you’re going to make a nation to preserve the Jewish people and culture, you want to have only Jews in it. Otherwise, some silly young person marries outside the fold, and then those genes get enfolded into the group, and when this happens enough, the group becomes a generic mix of humanity — it’s no longer Jewish. Enough competing ideologies and people get sick of the decision and turn their backs on Judaism. When culture becomes mixed, there is no dominant strain, and so people get confused and who rushes in to re-educate them? Marketers. They hate culture because it handles needs with learned practices, not products. Culture is bad marketing. Marketing is bad culture. But it’s what replaces culture in mixed culture states. Just look at the USA. What works better than mixed-culture/mixed-race (“diverse” or “multicultural”) states? Organic states: one language, one set of values, one culture, one heritage. – “Diversity continues to fail” And base our reasoning in sound conservative tradition: As a philosophy, conservatism espouses the following: This is a starting list of true conservative values. You will notice that exactly zero of these are popular. That is because what is popular is always wish-fulfillment fantasies (“you can be a rock star”), making excuses (“you’re only poor because of the Reds, not because you do so much meth”), endorsing hedonism (“if it feels good, do it”) and encouraging apathy and complacency. – “The future of the right” Introduce futurist and deep ecologist elements. Conservatism formed before the industrial revolution made environmental crisis manifest. For this reason, it needs to catch up — by going back to the mostly conservative thinkers who invented conservation, and with it, the need for a national spirit of valuing nature and thus wanting to conserve it. If we look at the works of thinkers as diverse as Garrett Hardin and Arne Naess, we see that environmentalism cannot work as a tack-on. We have to have a culture, and it must be part of that culture, so that we can work it seamlessly into our society at large. Environmentalists hate this idea because it puts them out of a job. For the same reason, white nationalists hate the idea because it supplants their race-fanaticism with conservation as the highest abstract level of our values system — we conserve forests just like we conserve culture and heritage. Disenfranchise the disinterested. In our modern society, the disinterested masses represent a threat because they will treat politics like a sporting event. Generally oblivious to politics, they will get involved if there is a chance that it can become like sports an us-versus-them scenario. What makes this complicated is that appearances don’t define reality. Leftism appears to be more collaborative: give others what they want, eliminate authority, and we’ll all work together. However, in reality all expansions of possibility include both positive and negative, so in the interest of trying all options there are going to be good options — and very bad ones. In human terms good are the productive and inventive and diligent; bad are the criminal, the perverse, the disaffected directionless and angry. So true collaboration probably doesn’t involve accepting everyone, and since we know some solutions are better than others, it must involve a hierarchy of promoting good solutions and demoting bad ones. This is not only like natural selection, but it resembles the scientific method: come up with many hypotheses,"

But, he added, “I am afraid that the Democrats will draw the conclusion … that we shouldn’t do anything. I completely disagree with that. “The Democrats may have to give up some short-term political gain by whipping up fear, if it’s a reasonable Social Security proposal, if it’s a reasonable Medicare proposal. You cannot have healthcare devour the economy,” he said. But Clinton insisted that Medicare costs have to be dealt with to get a grip on budget deficits. The former president charged that Republicans are being haunted by their decision to distort the Obama healthcare reforms to Medicare Advantage in the 2010 election. “The Republicans ran to the left of the Democrats,” he noted. He reiterated a complaint that Democrats did not do enough on the campaign trail to explain the changes. Democrats favor reining in healthcare costs by strengthening the power of the Medicare Independent Payment Advisory Board to restrict payments.Clinton said that Medicare and Medicaid reform can be done only as part of a plan to reduce healthcare cost inflation.The former president, speaking at a fiscal summit convened by the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, said he believes there will be a bipartisan deficit deal. He argued that the pain of cuts should be delayed until the economic recovery has taken root.The “genius of Bowles-Simpson,” Clinton said, referring to the fiscal commission plan, is that it makes “big changes,” but delays them.Clinton said politicians should not be held captive to polls that show the public is against raising the debt ceiling, and he said that President Obama may need to give an address on the consequences of a default.He also said that one of the worst things about the growing national debt is the fact that the nation owes money to countries that have a trade surplus with the United States.He said the U.S. has reduced trade-agreement enforcement over a decade due to fear of its creditors. “Nobody slugs their banker,” he said.

On Wednesday, Soquel High School suspended at least two students. The students say it’s because of allegations, they’re part of a white supremacist group. “All the girls wore pink, all the sports guys wore tank tops,” says Soquel High Senior Mikey Donnelly. “We were all going to wear white so that was the plan. Just wear white t-shirts to identify ourselves and look back and say that was our group of friends right there.” Soquel High Senior Mikey Donnelly wore a white t-shirt for his senior class photo Tuesday. About 10 of his friends did the same. That decision may seem harmless. But Soquel High suspended Donnelly for three days because of it. Donnelly said the school told him people were offended and intimidated by his group, claiming they’re a white supremacist gang. “I do think this is BS,” says Donnelly. “I’m not a white supremacist in any way shape or form. If I did say white power, I would probably say it just as much as I say black power.” He’s not the only one upset. “I feel disrespected,” says Soquel High Senior David Mine. Mine also wore a white t-shirt and was also suspended. He’s missing out on finals and that could jeopardize his graduation. “I’m Asian,” says Mine. “I don’t see how I can be a white supremacist. I’m against it completely.” I don’t know about you; but if I were accused of something as stupid as this, if I were not a White Supremacist, I would most likely want to become one or at the very least, I would really begin to rethink my feelings about politics and multiculturalism. But, this is what happens when political correctness gets out of control. Not to mention, what is wrong with having a “White Pride” group? Blacks have “Black pride” groups; so why the double standard? It is because liberals and some Neo-Conservatives, like to demonize we WASP’s. (White Anglo-Saxon Protestants) All because of the stupidity of the Southern Democrats of days gone by. We WASP’s will have to carry that guilt card, and demonetization for the rest of time. Just ask Rick Sanchez, Taki Theodoracopulos, Pat Buchanan and Ron Paul. It is truly a sad state of affairs.

"Political Byline This blog is no longer active as of October 31, 2011 Posted onMay 27, 2011AuthorPatrick2 Comments This video comes via HotAir.com… I want to share this video, but first a few thoughts of my own… Over the course of my blogger career here, I have written repeatedly about the Internationalist Democrats, who have sold the American Worker up the river on more than one occasion. President Bill Clinton did it, with the signing of the NAFTA and TAFTA agreements and now President Barack Obama is doing it with exporting oil from Brazil. The problem is, Obama wants to fight against the American oil companies and their monopoly on the prices of gas. In the process of this, he is tossing under the bus, the most important part of his own base —- The American Worker. Honestly, If President Obama wants to do something to lower gas prices, then maybe he should put pressure on the OPEC cartel and start demanding that they lower prices of oil, further more; President Obama should start going after the oil speculators, who drive up the cost of oil. Again, it is another example of how Internationalist Democrats fight battles, exactly backwards of how they should be fought. This video proves that. To my Democratic Party friends — this is whom you elected in 2008.

See if they've had opportunity to veto overspending in their city or their state and some governing body. See if they've seized the opportunity to save other people's money and not squander it. See if they've had opportunity to go to the mat in protecting second amendment rights and every constitutional rights. See if they have in their own personal lives lived a physically and socially conservative life and really walked the walk not just talk the talk…We have to do our homework. Don't let the media define who these candidates are. Let us, as constituents, as voters, as potential candidates…do our homework."" Indeed. Governor Palin has just spoken arguably the most important truth. With liberty comes responsibility. All too often, too many of us are content to let someone else do the ""homework"" for us and then profess shock when the wheels very predictably fly off and our favorite politician, program, or entitlement ends up in a ditch. ""Go along to get along"" clearly is still the order of the day for many. Power is not easy to wrest from the corrupt, from the entitled, from the lazy, or from the compromised. That said. We must. At least we must make a good-faith effort to try. Abraham Lincoln once said, ""America will never be destroyed from the outside. If we falter and lose our freedoms, it will be because we destroyed ourselves."" At what point do we admit we are faltering? At what point do we snap out of it and better vet those who proclaim themselves our ""leaders?"" At what point do we scream at our politicians: ""We will compromise our principles no more.""

"inety-nine nay. I asked Kucinich if he is finding the Afghan hill too steep to climb. “Never!” he replied sharply. “Ultimately, we may have to wait for millions of Americans to take to the streets. In a way, that is what the Tea Party has been about, except that it’s rapidly being usurped by corporate interests. But the movement represented an authentic expression of a dissatisfaction that people have with the government. Sooner or later, people will get it.” Jones and Ron Paul of Texas are the only Republican members of the Out of Afghanistan Caucus, which includes Democrats Kucinich, John Conyers Jr., Bob Filner, Raúl Grijalva, Michael Honda, Barbara Lee, Jim McDermott, James McGovern, John Olver, Jan Schakowsky, José Serrano and Lynn Woolsey. The caucus, citing recent polls, issued a statement on March 16 saying, “The American people understand that our country’s fiscal state renders the continued funding of a war that costs over $2 billion a week unsustainable. A substantial withdrawal of troops later this year will go a long way towards rebalancing our domestic and overseas priorities and reduce government spending by billions of dollars.” Jones told me he and his allies plan to take these steps in the coming months: § Find a respected general or public figure to speak out against the war to give cover to wavering members of Congress. “We need a drum major,” he said. § Have Jones and McGovern campaign against continuing the war in early presidential primary states like Iowa and New Hampshire. They hope to push the Afghan War front and center in the American consciousness by addressing college students and encouraging presidential candidates to state their position on the war at their rallies. “What we want to do here is increase the antiwar pressure on the Congress,” McGovern told me. “The antiwar sentiment is growing. I think we’re gaining traction. I really do. I’m a liberal; Walter Jones is a conservative. There is an alliance between liberals and conservatives that is emerging to end this war. “Hey, look, I read my history about the Vietnam War and Congress’s role,” McGovern continued. “It was more and more people who got on board in every vote that ultimately forced the Nixon White House belatedly to end that war. We have 100,000 troops in Afghanistan, and nobody wants to talk about it. It’s sometimes hard for me to fathom why a nation as great as ours can’t muster the necessary will to bring a war to an end that should be brought to an end. The mission changes every year. Al Qaeda is no longer there. Now we’re going to try to keep the Taliban in check. We’ll be there forever if that’s the goal.” To see how Jones’s get-out-of-Afghanistan campaign is going over in his hometown, I talked with a wide spectrum of Farmville residents in restaurants, stores and St. Elizabeth Catholic Church. Nobody had a harsh word for Jones the man, even those who want the military to finish the job rather than withdraw too soon. “He hasn’t become a Washington politician,” said Nichole Reason, 23, a bartender at the Pour Haus Pub, the only bar in Farmville, in a typical comment. “He’s still a North Carolina man; he still looks out for the local people.” Only Brooklyn-raised Father Joseph Yaeger, pastor of St. Elizabeth, had a needling comment about his parishioner. With eyes a-twinkle, Yaeger declared, “Jones is a fine man. But he’s a Republican. I can’t forgive him for that.” I found one person who was glad to see Jones move out of Farmville—years ago, when he left to attend Hargrave Military Academy in Chatham, Virginia, for his last two years of high school. His then–wife to be, JoeAnne Whitehurst, was in school in nearby Bethel, a fierce basketball rival of Farmville’s. “I hated him when I was growing up in Bethel because he was so good in basketball,” she said. “He was a gunner.” So how does she feel now about being the wife of Congressman Jones? “I’m an abnormal political wife, first of all. When he was elected to Congress in 1994, I retired from teaching because I thought I was going to need to be in Washington all the time. I stayed up there in DC for two years,” she said, noting that she decided she enjoyed Farmville more. So she moved back here to cover the home front for her husband, as Bess Truman had done before her in Independence, Missouri. When a senator asked her why she did this, JoeAnne replied, “Because my name is not on the ballot.” For Walter Jones, whose name is on the ballot, guilt has been a powerful force for making amends to his God, and to the men and women he had a hand in sending into Iraq and to his constituents. It has impelled him to try to fire up a national debate over the wisdom of continuing to fight what he considers a hopeless, never-ending war in Afghanistan.

I can’t forgive him for that.” I found one person who was glad to see Jones move out of Farmville—years ago, when he left to attend Hargrave Military Academy in Chatham, Virginia, for his last two years of high school. His then–wife to be, JoeAnne Whitehurst, was in school in nearby Bethel, a fierce basketball rival of Farmville’s. “I hated him when I was growing up in Bethel because he was so good in basketball,” she said. “He was a gunner.” So how does she feel now about being the wife of Congressman Jones? “I’m an abnormal political wife, first of all. When he was elected to Congress in 1994, I retired from teaching because I thought I was going to need to be in Washington all the time. I stayed up there in DC for two years,” she said, noting that she decided she enjoyed Farmville more. So she moved back here to cover the home front for her husband, as Bess Truman had done before her in Independence, Missouri. When a senator asked her why she did this, JoeAnne replied, “Because my name is not on the ballot.” For Walter Jones, whose name is on the ballot, guilt has been a powerful force for making amends to his God, and to the men and women he had a hand in sending into Iraq and to his constituents. It has impelled him to try to fire up a national debate over the wisdom of continuing to fight what he considers a hopeless, never-ending war in Afghanistan. § Have Jones and McGovern campaign against continuing the war in early presidential primary states like Iowa and New Hampshire. They hope to push the Afghan War front and center in the American consciousness by addressing college students and encouraging presidential candidates to state their position on the war at their rallies. “What we want to do here is increase the antiwar pressure on the Congress,” McGovern told me. “The antiwar sentiment is growing. I think we’re gaining traction. I really do. I’m a liberal; Walter Jones is a conservative. There is an alliance between liberals and conservatives that is emerging to end this war. “Hey, look, I read my history about the Vietnam War and Congress’s role,” McGovern continued. “It was more and more people who got on board in every vote that ultimately forced the Nixon White House belatedly to end that war. We have 100,000 troops in Afghanistan, and nobody wants to talk about it. It’s sometimes hard for me to fathom why a nation as great as ours can’t muster the necessary will to bring a war to an end that should be brought to an end. The mission changes every year. Al Qaeda is no longer there. Now we’re going to try to keep the Taliban in check. We’ll be there forever if that’s the goal.” To see how Jones’s get-out-of-Afghanistan campaign is going over in his hometown, I talked with a wide spectrum of Farmville residents in restaurants, stores and St. Elizabeth Catholic Church. Nobody had a harsh word for Jones the man, even those who want the military to finish the job rather than withdraw too soon. “He hasn’t become a Washington politician,” said Nichole Reason, 23, a bartender at the Pour Haus Pub, the only bar in Farmville, in a typical comment. “He’s still a North Carolina man; he still looks out for the local people.” Only Brooklyn-raised Father Joseph Yaeger, pastor of St. Elizabeth, had a needling comment about his parishioner. With eyes a-twinkle, Yaeger declared, “Jones is a fine man. But he’s a Republican. I A pro–Iraq War conservative Republican now fiercely opposes the war in Afghanistan.

Farmville, North Carolina The reason the man of the house—Republican Congressman Walter Jones Jr.—was not home on a recent Sunday was that his conscience was bothering him. So he went to his 3rd Congressional District office in nearby Greenville, North Carolina, to add handwritten notes of condolence to the form letters he sends to every family who loses a son or daughter in our wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. During an interview in their comfortable but not palatial home here, Jones’s feisty wife of forty-five years, JoeAnne, described his laserlike focus on getting those letters written on weekends. “You can’t reach him,” she said. “He doesn’t answer his phone. I had to reach him one Sunday for something. So I drove into Greenville and tapped on his office window. The man never stops.” With one painful exception, the devout Jones, who grew up in this sparsely populated part of the tobacco belt and seems to know everyone in Farmville (population 4,615), votes the way God and his conscience tell him to. Jones considers himself a conservative on most issues, including abortion. “A child is a gift from God,” he argued. “No baby should be aborted unless a mother has been raped, impregnated by incest or would risk her life by giving birth. Even in those three cases it should be the mother’s choice.” Sometimes his conscience tells him to vote differently from the way House Speaker John Boehner and other Republican Party operatives ask him to. This drives party leaders nuts. Jones’s independence has probably kept him from rising to a committee chairmanship as his Democratic dad did before him. The elder Jones, who died in 1992, was chair of the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee from 1981 to 1992. Even though more retired military people live in Jones’s district than in most other districts in the country, he has discovered that many marines who served in Afghanistan agree with him that the United States is fighting a hopeless, never-ending war for a corrupt government. Jones, who gets down on his knees every night to pray for God’s guidance on the issues he will be voting on in the House of Representatives, is conscience-stricken about all the American lives being lost or ruined in Afghanistan and Iraq. His conscience, laminated to his guilt for voting to invade Iraq in 2002, has radicalized this conservative Republican from rural North Carolina into doing everything he can to get the roughly 100,000 US troops in Afghanistan the hell out of there. Jones is seeking co-sponsors on a bill that would force President Obama to send a plan to Congress to pull all our troops out of Afghanistan. Jones is especially eager to win over Republicans to his side in hopes of compelling Boehner to become more flexible on the pullout. As of the May Congressional recess, Jones had forty-one co-sponsors signed up, including seven Republicans. Jones has allied himself with liberal Democrat Dennis Kucinich on many issues raised by the “war on terror” and Obama’s decision in late March to go to war against the Libyan government without bothering to get Congressional authorization. “We must not let any war continue absent legal authorization by Congress,” Kucinich said. He contends that Obama not only violated the War Powers Act of 1973 but also the Constitution, which empowers Congress, not the president, to declare war and provide for the common defense, in Arti- cle 1, Section 8. Kucinich has vowed to force a vote in the House “to end US military operations in Libya.” Jones and Kucinich are discussing filing suit in federal court to force a judicial ruling on whether Obama overstepped his constitutional bounds regarding Libya. Jones is also a point man in an effort in the House to grab back from the president the powers the founding fathers gave Congress to declare war and provide for the common defense. Not since 1941, when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, has Congress exercised its right to declare war. Jones sponsored a bill that would subject a president who lied in giving the reasons for going to war to prosecution by the Justice Department. The measure never left the subcommittee. As for Obama’s bombing of Libya, Jones said, “We’re neutered as a Congress. It’s like we don’t exist.” * * * Some readers may remember Jones as the Congressman who in 2003 got the House cafeterias to change the name of french fries to “freedom fries” on their menus. His idea was to punish the French government for not backing George W. Bush’s invasion of Iraq. But Jones, 68, has changed his feathers from hawk to dove since the Iraq War, a change that followed from his conversion years ago from Democrat to Republican and from Baptist to Catholic. “I went to all the classified briefings” that the Bush administration arranged for members of Congress to make its case for invading Iraq, he said. “When the night came to vote on the resolution to give Bush the authority to go into Iraq, I walked to the floor not believing the justification was there. My conscience said Saddam did not bring down the Twin Towers. So I go to the floor, and I’m more concerned about those down in my district who had fought for this country and how they would feel, because we had the administration telling the American people that Saddam was behind the towers. My guilt is that I was not strong enough to vote my conscience as a man of faith. All this comes from my not trusting God as much as I profess to do and being concerned about being re-elected instead of being concerned about doing what’s right for our military.” Jones is writing a book explaining his change of heart and apologizing for voting to invade Iraq. His guilt about that vote, seeing crippled teenagers wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan, attending military funerals where he sees children with pain in their eyes because they are burying fathers and mothers they loved and cannot believe are dead—all these things and more drove Jones into reading everything he could find about the attempts of previous empires to occupy Afghanistan. The more he read, the stronger he felt the urgency of getting the troops out. Here is Jones’s brief for withdrawing from Afghanistan as early as December 31, drawn from our talks and his recent statements on the House floor and in news conferences: § ”Afghanistan will never be changed,” no matter how many troops we send there or how many billions we spend in the corruptly led country. “Great leaders and great nations have tried to change Afghanistan. We’re trying to change a country that no one else has changed. It’s different from Iraq in a multitude of ways. At least Iraq had a semblance of government. Afghanistan has none of that.” § The Afghan Infrastructure Fund of $400 million “would help create another ‘bridge to nowhere,’” Jones contended in championing an amendment to eliminate the money. It is “going to be borrowed money from the Chinese to begin with…. We’re propping up a corrupt, dishonest government headed by President Karzai,” he said. “And we’re going to say to the American people, we can’t help you with your infrastructure needs in your counties, in your towns.” Jones’s amendment was defeated 294 to 135, but he got ninety-nine Democrats and thirty-six Republicans, including Republican Fred Upton of Michigan, chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, to vote with him. § ”I want to share very quickly a letter from a retired colonel who’s a marine [who] lives in my district,” Jones told his House colleagues. He quoted: “‘I would have been on my third or fourth deployment by now to a war that has gone on too long…. It makes no sense if we’re there four years or forty. The results will be the same…. This war is costing the United States billions of dollars a month to wage, and we still continue to get more young Americans killed. The Afghan war has no end state for us.’” § ”I want to put a face on this debate,” Jones said in another House speech. He showed a picture of Tyler Jordan, a young boy whose father, Gunnery Sgt. Phillip Jordan of Cincinnati, was killed in Afghanistan. “He is attending his father’s funeral…. The 6-year-old little boy—you can’t see his eyes, but they hurt. They’re pained. How many more Tyler Jordans are going to be waiting for their daddy or mom to come home to be buried if we stay there four, five, six or seven more years, as has been indicated by the leadership of the military and this administration?” § ”I’m concerned that Mr. Obama is going to get cornered into staying in Afghanistan much longer than 2014,” Jones told me. “Three or four more years, we will wear out the military and its equipment.” Jones believes his anti–Afghan War effort is slowly winning supporters in the House. Most of them are Democrats, but he has high hopes of converting Tea Party Republicans looking for more places to cut the budget. “A lot of these Tea Party types said during their campaigns that they were ready to get out of Afghanistan,” Jones said. “Slowly, but not enough of them, Republicans are beginning to inch toward bringing the troops home.” Jones said he was encouraged by a recent Washington Post/ABC News poll that found 64 percent of the public does not think the war in Afghanistan is worth fighting, and 73 percent say the United States should withdraw “a substantial number” of combat forces from Afghanistan this summer. Jones and Kucinich co-sponsored a resolution that would require Obama to withdraw US forces from Afghanistan by the end of this year. The House voted it down 321 to 93 on March 17. Only eight of the 230 Republicans who voted on the resolution favored it; Democrats were split, with eighty-five voting yea and ninety-nine nay. I asked Kucinich if he is finding the Afghan hill too steep to climb. “Never!” he replied sharply. “Ultimately, we may have to wait for millions of Americans to take to the streets. In a way, that is what the Tea Party has been about, except that it’s rapidly being usurped by corporate interests. But the movement represented an authentic expression of a dissatisfaction that people have with the government. Sooner or later, people will get it.” Jones and Ron Paul of Texas are the only Republican members of the Out of Afghanistan Caucus, which includes Democrats Kucinich, John Conyers Jr., Bob Filner, Raúl Grijalva, Michael Honda, Barbara Lee, Jim McDermott, James McGovern, John Olver, Jan Schakowsky, José Serrano and Lynn Woolsey. The caucus, citing recent polls, issued a statement on March 16 saying, “The American people understand that our country’s fiscal state renders the continued funding of a war that costs over $2 billion a week unsustainable. A substantial withdrawal of troops later this year will go a long way towards rebalancing our domestic and overseas priorities and reduce government spending by billions of dollars.” Jones told me he and his allies plan to take these steps in the coming months: § Find a respected general or public figure to speak out against the war to give cover to wavering members of Congress. “We need a drum major,” he said. § Have Jones and McGovern campaign against continuing the war in early presidential primary states like Iowa and New Hampshire. They hope to push the Afghan War front and center in the American consciousness by addressing college students and encouraging presidential candidates to state their position on the war at their rallies. “What we want to do here is increase the antiwar pressure on the Congress,” McGovern told me. “The antiwar sentiment is growing. I think we’re gaining traction. I really do. I’m a liberal; Walter Jones is a conservative. There is an alliance between liberals and conservatives that is emerging to end this war. “Hey, look, I read my history about the Vietnam War and Congress’s role,” McGovern continued. “It was more and more people who got on board in every vote that ultimately forced the Nixon White House belatedly to end that war.

Al Qaeda is no longer there. Now we’re going to try to keep the Taliban in check.

Jones is also a point man in an effort in the House to grab back from the president the powers the founding fathers gave Congress to declare war and provide for the common defense. Not since 1941, when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, has Congress exercised its right to declare war. Jones sponsored a bill that would subject a president who lied in giving the reasons for going to war to prosecution by the Justice Department. The measure never left the subcommittee. As for Obama’s bombing of Libya, Jones said, “We’re neutered as a Congress. It’s like we don’t exist.” * * * Some readers may remember Jones as the Congressman who in 2003 got the House cafeterias to change the name of french fries to “freedom fries” on their menus. His idea was to punish the French government for not backing George W. Bush’s invasion of Iraq. But Jones, 68, has changed his feathers from hawk to dove since the Iraq War, a change that followed from his conversion years ago from Democrat to Republican and from Baptist to Catholic. “I went to all the classified briefings” that the Bush administration arranged for members of Congress to make its case for invading Iraq, he said. “When the night came to vote on the resolution to give Bush the authority to go into Iraq, I walked to the floor not believing the justification was there. My conscience said Saddam did not bring down the Twin Towers. So I go to the floor, and I’m more concerned about those down in my district who had fought for this country and how they would feel, because we had the administration telling the American people that Saddam was behind the towers. My guilt is that I was not strong enough to vote my conscience as a man of faith. All this comes from my not trusting God as much as I profess to do and being concerned about being re-elected instead of being concerned about doing what’s right for our military.” Jones is writing a book explaining his change of heart and apologizing for voting to invade Iraq. His guilt about that vote, seeing crippled teenagers wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan, attending military funerals where he sees children with pain in their eyes because they are burying fathers and mothers they loved and cannot believe are dead—all these things and more drove Jones into reading everything he could find about the attempts of previous empires to occupy Afghanistan. The more he read, the stronger he felt the urgency of getting the troops out. Here is Jones’s brief for withdrawing from Afghanistan as early as December 31, drawn from our talks and his recent statements on the House floor and in news conferences: § ”Afghanistan will never be changed,” no matter how many troops we send there or how many billions we spend in the corruptly led country. “Great leaders and great nations have tried to change Afghanistan. We’re trying to change a country that no one else has changed. It’s different from Iraq in a multitude of ways. At least Iraq had a semblance of government. Afghanistan has none of that.” § The Afghan Infrastructure Fund of $400 million “would help create another ‘bridge to nowhere,’” Jones contended in championing an amendment to eliminate the money. It is “going to be borrowed money from the Chinese to begin with…. We’re propping up a corrupt, dishonest government headed by President Karzai,” he said. “And we’re going to say to the American people, we can’t help you with your infrastructure needs in your counties, in your towns.” Jones’s amendment was defeated 294 to 135, but he got ninety-nine Democrats and thirty-six Republicans, including Republican Fred Upton of Michigan, chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, to vote with him. § ”I want to share very quickly a letter from a retired colonel who’s a marine [who] lives in my district,” Jones told his House colleagues. He quoted: “‘I would have been on my third or fourth deployment by now to a war that has gone on too long…. It makes no sense if we’re there four years or forty. The results will be the same…. This war is costing the United States billions of dollars a month to wage, and we still continue to get more young Americans killed. The Afghan war has no end state for us.’” § ”I want to put a face on this debate,” Jones said in another House speech. He showed a picture of Tyler Jordan, a young boy whose father, Gunnery Sgt. Phillip Jordan of Cincinnati, was killed in Afghanistan. “He is attending his father’s funeral…. The 6-year-old little boy—you can’t see his eyes, but they hurt. They’re pained. How many more Tyler Jordans are going to be waiting for their daddy or mom to come home to be buried if we stay there four, five, six or seven more years, as has been indicated by the leadership of the military and this administration?” § ”I’m concerned that Mr. Obama is going to get cornered into staying in Afghanistan much longer than 2014,” Jones told me. “Three or four more years, we will wear out the military and its equipment.” Jones believes his anti–Afghan War effort is slowly winning supporters in the House. Most of them are Democrats, but he has high hopes of converting Tea Party Republicans looking for more places to cut the budget. “A lot of these Tea Party types said during their campaigns that they were ready to get out of Afghanistan,” Jones said. “Slowly, but not enough of them, Republicans are beginning to inch toward bringing the troops home.” Jones said he was encouraged by a recent Washington Post/ABC News poll that found 64 percent of the public does not think the war in Afghanistan is worth fighting, and 73 percent say the United States should withdraw “a substantial number” of combat forces from Afghanistan this summer. Jones and Kucinich co-sponsored a resolution that would require Obama to withdraw US forces from Afghanistan by the end of this year. The House voted it down 321 to 93 on March 17. Only eight of the 230 Republicans who voted on the resolution favored it; Democrats were split, with eighty-five voting yea and ninety-nine nay. I asked Kucinich if he is finding the Afghan hill too steep to climb. “Never!” he replied sharply. “Ultimately, we may have to wait for millions of Americans to take to the streets. In a way, that is what the Tea Party has been about, except that it’s rapidly being usurped by corporate interests. But the movement represented an authentic expression of a dissatisfaction that people have with the government. Sooner or later, people will get it.” Jones and Ron Paul of Texas are the only Republican members of the Out of Afghanistan Caucus, which includes Democrats Kucinich, John Conyers Jr., Bob Filner, Raúl Grijalva, Michael Honda, Barbara Lee, Jim McDermott, James McGovern, John Olver, Jan Schakowsky, José Serrano and Lynn Woolsey. The caucus, citing recent polls, issued a statement on March 16 saying, “The American people understand that our country’s fiscal state renders the continued funding of a war that costs over $2 billion a week unsustainable. A substantial withdrawal of troops later this year will go a long way towards rebalancing our domestic and overseas priorities and reduce government spending by billions of dollars.” Jones told me he and his allies plan to take these steps in the coming months: § Find a respected general or public figure to speak out against the war to give cover to wavering members of Congress. “We need a drum major,” he said. § Have Jones and McGovern campaign against continuing the war in early presidential primary states like Iowa and New Hampshire. They hope to push the Afghan War front and center in the American consciousness by addressing college students and encouraging presidential candidates to state their position on the war at their rallies. “What we want to do here is increase the antiwar pressure on the Congress,” McGovern told me. “The antiwar sentiment is growing. I think we’re gaining traction. I really do. I’m a liberal; Walter Jones is a conservative. There is an alliance between liberals and conservatives that is emerging to end this war. “Hey, look, I read my history about the Vietnam War and Congress’s role,” McGovern continued. “It was more and more people who got on board in every vote that ultimately forced the Nixon White House belatedly to end that war. We have 100,000 troops in Afghanistan, and nobody wants to talk about it. It’s sometimes hard for me to fathom why a nation as great as ours can’t muster the necessary will to bring a war to an end that should be brought to an end. The mission changes every year. Al Qaeda is no longer there. Now we’re going to try to keep the Taliban in check. We’ll be there forever if that’s the goal.” To see how Jones’s get-out-of-Afghanistan campaign is going over in his hometown, I talked with a wide spectrum of Farmville residents in restaurants, stores and St. Elizabeth Catholic Church. Nobody had a harsh word for Jones the man, even those who want the military to finish the job rather than withdraw too soon. “He hasn’t become a Washington politician,” said Nichole Reason, 23, a bartender at the Pour Haus Pub, the only bar in Farmville, in a typical comment. “He’s still a North Carolina man; he still looks out for the local people.” Only Brooklyn-raised Father Joseph Yaeger, pastor of St. Elizabeth, had a needling comment about his parishioner. With eyes a-twinkle, Yaeger declared, “Jones is a fine man. But he’s a Republican. I can’t forgive him for that.” I found one person who was glad to see Jones move out of Farmville—years ago, when he left to attend Hargrave Military Academy in Chatham, Virginia, for his last two years of high school. His then–wife to be, JoeAnne Whitehurst, was in school in nearby Bethel, a fierce basketball rival of Farmville’s. “I hated him when I was growing up in Bethel because he was so good in basketball,” she said. “He was a gunner.” So how does she feel now about being the wife of Congressman Jones? “I’m an abnormal political wife, first of all. When he was elected to Congress in 1994, I retired from teaching because I thought I was going to need to be in Washington all the time. I stayed up there in DC for two years,” she said, noting that she decided she enjoyed Farmville more. So she moved back here to cover the home front for her husband, as Bess Truman had done before her in Independence, Missouri. When a senator asked her why she did this, JoeAnne replied, “Because my name is not on the ballot.” For Walter Jones, whose name is on the ballot, guilt has been a powerful force for making amends to his God, and to the men and women he had a hand in sending into Iraq and to his constituents. It has impelled him to try to fire up a national debate over the wisdom of continuing to fight what he considers a hopeless, never-ending war in Afghanistan. Sometimes his conscience tells him to vote differently from the way House Speaker John Boehner and other Republican Party operatives ask him to. This drives party leaders nuts. Jones’s independence has probably kept him from rising to a committee chairmanship as his Democratic dad did before him. The elder Jones, who died in 1992, was chair of the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee from 1981 to 1992. Even though more retired military people live in Jones’s district than in most other districts in the country, he has discovered that many marines who served in Afghanistan agree with him that the United States is fighting a hopeless, never-ending war for a corrupt government. Jones, who gets down on his knees every night to pray for God’s guidance on the issues he will be voting on in the House of Representatives, is conscience-stricken about all the American lives being lost or ruined in Afghanistan and Iraq. His conscience, laminated to his guilt for voting to invade Iraq in 2002, has radicalized this conservative Republican from rural North Carolina into doing everything he can to get the roughly 100,000 US troops in Afghanistan the hell out of there. Jones is seeking co-sponsors on a bill that would force President Obama to send a plan to Congress to pull all our troops out of Afghanistan. Jones is especially eager to win over Republicans to his side in hopes of compelling Boehner to become more flexible on the pullout. As of the May Congressional recess, Jones had forty-one co-sponsors signed up, including seven Republicans. Jones has allied himself with liberal Democrat Dennis Kucinich on many issues raised by the “war on terror” and Obama’s decision in late March to go to war against the Libyan government without bothering to get Congressional authorization. “We must not let any war continue absent legal authorization by Congress,” Kucinich said. He contends that Obama not only violated the War Powers Act of 1973 but also the Constitution, which empowers Congress, not the president, to declare war and provide for the common defense, in Arti- cle 1, Section 8. Kucinich has vowed to force a vote in the House “to end US military operations in Libya.” Jones and Kucinich are discussing filing suit in federal court to force a judicial ruling on whether Obama overstepped his constitutional bounds regarding Libya.

When he was elected to Congress in 1994, I retired from teaching because I thought I was going to need to be in Washington all the time. I stayed up there in DC for two years,” she said, noting that she decided she enjoyed Farmville more. So she moved back here to cover the home front for her husband, as Bess Truman had done before her in Independence, Missouri. When a senator asked her why she did this, JoeAnne replied, “Because my name is not on the ballot.” For Walter Jones, whose name is on the ballot, guilt has been a powerful force for making amends to his God, and to the men and women he had a hand in sending into Iraq and to his constituents. It has impelled him to try to fire up a national debate over the wisdom of continuing to fight what he considers a hopeless, never-ending war in Afghanistan. Jones is seeking co-sponsors on a bill that would force President Obama to send a plan to Congress to pull all our troops out of Afghanistan. Jones is especially eager to win over Republicans to his side in hopes of compelling Boehner to become more flexible on the pullout. As of the May Congressional recess, Jones had forty-one co-sponsors signed up, including seven Republicans. Jones has allied himself with liberal Democrat Dennis Kucinich on many issues raised by the “war on terror” and Obama’s decision in late March to go to war against the Libyan government without bothering to get Congressional authorization. “We must not let any war continue absent legal authorization by Congress,” Kucinich said. He contends that Obama not only violated the War Powers Act of 1973 but also the Constitution, which empowers Congress, not the president, to declare war and provide for the common defense, in Arti- cle 1, Section 8. Kucinich has vowed to force a vote in the House “to end US military operations in Libya.” Jones and Kucinich are discussing filing suit in federal court to force a judicial ruling on whether Obama overstepped his constitutional bounds regarding Libya. Jones is also a point man in an effort in the House to grab back from the president the powers the founding fathers gave Congress to declare war and provide for the common defense. Not since 1941, when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, has Congress exercised its right to declare war. Jones sponsored a bill that would subject a president who lied in giving the reasons for going to war to prosecution by the Justice Department. The measure never left the subcommittee. As for Obama’s bombing of Libya, Jones said, “We’re neutered as a Congress. It’s like we don’t exist.” * * * Some readers may remember Jones as the Congressman who in 2003 got the House cafeterias to change the name of french fries to “freedom fries” on their menus. His idea was to punish the French government for not backing George W. Bush’s invasion of Iraq. But Jones, 68, has changed his feathers from hawk to dove since the Iraq War, a change that followed from his conversion years ago from Democrat to Republican and from Baptist to Catholic. “I went to all the classified briefings” that the Bush administration arranged for members of Congress to make its case for invading Iraq, he said. “When the night came to vote on the resolution to give Bush the authority to go into Iraq, I walked to the floor not believing the justification was there. My conscience said Saddam did not bring down the Twin Towers. So I go to the floor, and I’m more concerned about those down in my district who had fought for this country and how they would feel, because we had the administration telling the American people that Saddam was behind the towers. My guilt is that I was not strong enough to vote my conscience as a man of faith. All this comes from my not trusting God as much as I profess to do and being concerned about being re-elected instead of being concerned about doing what’s right for our military.” Jones is writing a book explaining his change of heart and apologizing for voting to invade Iraq. His guilt about that vote, seeing crippled teenagers wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan, attending military funerals where he sees children with pain in their eyes because they are burying fathers and mothers they loved and cannot believe are dead—all these things and more drove Jones into reading everything he could find about the attempts of previous empires to occupy Afghanistan. The more he read, the stronger he felt the urgency of getting the troops out. Here is Jones’s brief for withdrawing from Afghanistan as early as December 31, drawn from our talks and his recent statements on the House floor and in news conferences: § ”Afghanistan will never be changed,” no matter how many troops we send there or how many billions we spend in the corruptly led country. “Great leaders and great nations have tried to change Afghanistan. We’re trying to change a country that no one else has changed. It’s different from Iraq in a multitude of ways. At least Iraq had a semblance of government. Afghanistan has none of that.” § The Afghan Infrastructure Fund of $400 million “would help create another ‘bridge to nowhere,’” Jones contended in championing an amendment to eliminate the money. It is “going to be borrowed money from the Chinese to begin with…. We’re propping up a corrupt, dishonest government headed by President Karzai,” he said. “And we’re going to say to the American people, we can’t help you with your infrastructure needs in your counties, in your towns.” Jones’s amendment was defeated 294 to 135, but he got ninety-nine Democrats and thirty-six Republicans, including Republican Fred Upton of Michigan, chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, to vote with him. § ”I want to share very quickly a letter from a retired colonel who’s a marine [who] lives in my district,” Jones told his House colleagues. He quoted: “‘I would have been on my third or fourth deployment by now to a war that has gone on too long…. It makes no sense if we’re there four years or forty. The results will be the same…. This war is costing the United States billions of dollars a month to wage, and we still continue to get more young Americans killed. The Afghan war has no end state for us.’” § ”I want to put a face on this debate,” Jones said in another House speech. He showed a picture of Tyler Jordan, a young boy whose father, Gunnery Sgt. Phillip Jordan of Cincinnati, was killed in Afghanistan. “He is attending his father’s funeral…. The 6-year-old little boy—you can’t see his eyes, but they hurt. They’re pained. How many more Tyler Jordans are going to be waiting for their daddy or mom to come home to be buried if we stay there four, five, six or seven more years, as has been indicated by the leadership of the military and this administration?” § ”I’m concerned that Mr. Obama is going to get cornered into staying in Afghanistan much longer than 2014,” Jones told me. “Three or four more years, we will wear out the military and its equipment.” Jones believes his anti–Afghan War effort is slowly winning supporters in the House. Most of them are Democrats, but he has high hopes of converting Tea Party Republicans looking for more places to cut the budget. “A lot of these Tea Party types said during their campaigns that they were ready to get out of Afghanistan,” Jones said. “Slowly, but not enough of them, Republicans are beginning to inch toward bringing the troops home.” Jones said he was encouraged by a recent Washington Post/ABC News poll that found 64 percent of the public does not think the war in Afghanistan is worth fighting, and 73 percent say the United States should withdraw “a substantial number” of combat forces from Afghanistan this summer. Jones and Kucinich co-sponsored a resolution that would require Obama to withdraw US forces from Afghanistan by the end of this year. The House voted it down 321 to 93 on March 17. Only eight of the 230 Republicans who voted on the resolution favored it; Democrats were split, with eighty-five voting yea and ninety-nine nay. I asked Kucinich if he is finding the Afghan hill too steep to climb. “Never!” he replied sharply. “Ultimately, we may have to wait for millions of Americans to take to the streets. In a way, that is what the Tea Party has been about, except that it’s rapidly being usurped by corporate interests. But the movement represented an authentic expression of a dissatisfaction that people have with the government. Sooner or later, people will get it.” Jones and Ron Paul of Texas are the only Republican members of the Out of Afghanistan Caucus, which includes Democrats Kucinich, John Conyers Jr., Bob Filner, Raúl Grijalva, Michael Honda, Barbara Lee, Jim McDermott, James McGovern, John Olver, Jan Schakowsky, José Serrano and Lynn Woolsey. The caucus, citing recent polls, issued a statement on March 16 saying, “The American people understand that our country’s fiscal state renders the continued funding of a war that costs over $2 billion a week unsustainable. A substantial withdrawal of troops later this year will go a long way towards rebalancing our domestic and overseas priorities and reduce government spending by billions of dollars.” Jones told me he and his allies plan to take these steps in the coming months: § Find a respected general or public figure to speak out against the war to give cover to wavering members of Congress. “We need a drum major,” he said. § Have Jones and McGovern campaign against continuing the war in early presidential primary states like Iowa and New Hampshire. They hope to push the Afghan War front and center in the American consciousness by addressing college students and encouraging presidential candidates to state their position on the war at their rallies. “What we want to do here is increase the antiwar pressure on the Congress,” McGovern told me. “The antiwar sentiment is growing. I think we’re gaining traction. I really do. I’m a liberal; Walter Jones is a conservative. There is an alliance between liberals and conservatives that is emerging to end this war. “Hey, look, I read my history about the Vietnam War and Congress’s role,” McGovern continued. “It was more and more people who got on board in every vote that ultimately forced the Nixon White House belatedly to end that war. We have 100,000 troops in Afghanistan, and nobody wants to talk about it. It’s sometimes hard for me to fathom why a nation as great as ours can’t muster the necessary will to bring a war to an end that should be brought to an end. The mission changes every year. Al Qaeda is no longer there. Now we’re going to try to keep the Taliban in check. We’ll be there forever if that’s the goal.” To see how Jones’s get-out-of-Afghanistan campaign is going over in his hometown, I talked with a wide spectrum of Farmville residents in restaurants, stores and St. Elizabeth Catholic Church. Nobody had a harsh word for Jones the man, even those who want the military to finish the job rather than withdraw too soon. “He hasn’t become a Washington politician,” said Nichole Reason, 23, a bartender at the Pour Haus Pub, the only bar in Farmville, in a typical comment. “He’s still a North Carolina man; he still looks out for the local people.” Only Brooklyn-raised Father Joseph Yaeger, pastor of St. Elizabeth, had a needling comment about his parishioner. With eyes a-twinkle, Yaeger declared, “Jones is a fine man. But he’s a Republican. I can’t forgive him for that.” I found one person who was glad to see Jones move out of Farmville—years ago, when he left to attend Hargrave Military Academy in Chatham, Virginia, for his last two years of high school.

To see how Jones’s get-out-of-Afghanistan campaign is going over in his hometown, I talked with a wide spectrum of Farmville residents in restaurants, stores and St. Elizabeth Catholic Church. Nobody had a harsh word for Jones the man, even those who want the military to finish the job rather than withdraw too soon. “He hasn’t become a Washington politician,” said Nichole Reason, 23, a bartender at the Pour Haus Pub, the only bar in Farmville, in a typical comment. “He’s still a North Carolina man; he still looks out for the local people.” Only Brooklyn-raised Father Joseph Yaeger, pastor of St. Elizabeth, had a needling comment about his parishioner. With eyes a-twinkle, Yaeger declared, “Jones is a fine man. But he’s a Republican. I can’t forgive him for that.” I found one person who was glad to see Jones move out of Farmville—years ago, when he left to attend Hargrave Military Academy in Chatham, Virginia, for his last two years of high school. His then–wife to be, JoeAnne Whitehurst, was in school in nearby Bethel, a fierce basketball rival of Farmville’s. “I hated him when I was growing up in Bethel because he was so good in basketball,” she said. “He was a gunner.” So how does she feel now about being the wife of Congressman Jones? “I’m an abnormal political wife, first of all. When he was elected to Congress in 1994, I retired from teaching because I thought I was going to need to be in Washington all the time. I stayed up there in DC for two years,” she said, noting that she decided she enjoyed Farmville more. So she moved back here to cover the home front for her husband, as Bess Truman had done before her in Independence, Missouri.

"In January, the Obama administration announced a major new initiative to revitalize the national economy called Startup America. Its main objective is to unleash the nation’s latent entrepreneurial energy. But it is just as likely to unleash a wave of failed enterprises and crony capitalism. For one thing, it may have already been exposed as a cynical political ploy. According to the American Spectator, in February, an unnamed White House staffer stated that Startup America was largely a ruse: “It’s one more way to engage corporate America. We know many of the executives are predisposed to Democrats, this is just a way to build more connections.” Even if it is instead a legitimate attempt to spur the economy, it should be met with skepticism — as should all such government programs. Government is rarely good at picking economic winners and losers, even when attempting to be objective. Startup America openly mixes political priorities with economic goals. Specifically, one of its core goals is to “inspire and empower an ever-greater diversity of communities and individuals.” Such a divided mission is a blueprint for failure and political payoffs. Another ill-conceived goal of the program is to “accelerate green technology innovation.” The environmental sector is often heralded as the wave of the future by the eco-friendly Obama administration, but one study by Spanish economist Gabriel Calzada showed that each “green” job created by his government actually destroyed 2.2 other jobs. And 90 percent of those green jobs were temporary. The program has two distinct strategies. One part is government action — mainly, providing capital for startup companies using $2 billion given by the Small Business Administration. This infusion of capital is probably the wrong tool for the job of jump-starting the economy. “A shortage of private equity is not what’s holding back America,” says Karlyn Mitchell, professor at NC State University and former Federal Reserve economist specializing in small business finance. (The more likely culprit for the economic malaise is uncertainty about the future.) The other strategy, consisting of corporations partnering with federal, state, and local agencies, is more complex. On the positive side, it doesn’t take an “all your eggs in one basket” approach. Different partners will tackle the problem of spurring entrepreneurial activity in different ways. One recently announced partnership, the Blackstone Entrepreneurs Network in North Carolina’s Research Triangle region, will spend $3.6 million donated by the Blackstone Group’s charitable foundation to recruit 15 “master entrepreneurs” to work with researchers at four universities. This arrangement is designed to tear down what, according to Mitchell, may be the most crucial roadblock to entrepreneurial success by university researchers: a deficiency of business savvy and expertise. Blackstone’s master entrepreneurs will guide them through the necessary paperwork and planning. But despite such hopeful details, Startup America’s total negatives outweigh the positive. Perhaps the biggest problem of all is the program’s potential for crony capitalism. Corporate charity often accompanies questionable quid pro quo agreements between private firms and government: in one particularly blatant example, in 2008, General Electric awarded $11 million in grants to schools in New York to Congressman Charles Rangel’s district, shortly after Rangel — the powerful head of the Ways and Means Committee — reversed his opposition to a tax shelter that greatly benefited GE. (Rangel has since been censured for other pay-to-play schemes.) Major corporations are rushing to sign up as program “partners,” including IBM, Ernst & Young, and Intel. Firms have already pledged over $800 million in services, expertise, and capital to the campaign. Given the comments by the aforementioned unnamed White House staffer, it is doubtful that altruism alone accounts for their generosity. With only $2.8 billion in mixed public-private funding to date, the program may look fairly insignificant now. But it has a great deal of potential for making economic mischief: the waste of taxpayers’ money, the interruption of natural market forces needed to actually restore prosperity, greater government control, and corruption. Let’s hope Startup America doesn’t do for entrepreneurship what HUD did for urban communities — or what Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac did for the housing industry. "
"Advertisement Supported by By Lizette Alvarez MIAMI — Less than 18 months before the next presidential election, Republican-controlled statehouses around the country are rewriting voting laws to require photo identification at the polls, reduce the number of days of early voting or tighten registration rules. Republican legislators say the new rules, which have advanced in 13 states in the past two months, offer a practical way to weed out fraudulent votes and preserve the integrity of the ballot box. Democrats say the changes have little to do with fraud prevention and more to do with placing obstacles in the way of possible Democratic voters, including young people and minorities. Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin and Gov. Rick Perry of Texas signed laws last week that would require each voter to show an official, valid photo ID to cast a ballot, joining Kansas and South Carolina. In Florida, which already had a photo law, Gov. Rick Scott signed a bill this month to tighten restrictions on third-party voter registration organizations — prompting the League of Women Voters to say it would cease registering voters in the state — and to shorten the number of early voting days. Twelve states now require photo identification to vote. The battleground states of Ohio and Pennsylvania are among those moving ahead on voter ID bills, part of a trend that seems likely to intensify the kind of pitched partisan jousting over voting that has cropped up in recent presidential races. When voters in predominantly black neighborhoods in Florida saw their votes challenged in the contested Bush-Gore election of 2000, Democrats made charges of disenfranchisement. In 2008 Acorn, a group organizing minority and low-income communities, became a particular target, with Republicans asserting that Acorn was trying to steal the election with large voter-registration drives, some of which were found to be seriously flawed. Democrats, who point to scant evidence of voter-impersonation fraud, say the unified Republican push for photo identification cards carries echoes of the Jim Crow laws — with their poll taxes and literacy tests — that inhibited black voters in the South from Reconstruction through the 1960s. Election experts say minorities, poor people and students — who tend to skew Democratic — are among those least likely to have valid driver’s licenses, the most prevalent form of identification. Older people, another group less likely to have licenses, are swing voters. Republicans argue that the requirements are commonplace. “If you have to show a picture ID to buy Sudafed, if you have to show a picture ID to get on an airplane, you should show a picture ID when you vote,” Gov. Nikki Haley said this month when she signed the bill into law in South Carolina, using a common refrain among Republicans. Changes to voter law tend to flow and ebb with election cycles as both Democrats and Republicans scramble to gain the upper hand when they hold power. The 2010 midterm election was a boon to Republicans, who now control 59 chambers of state legislatures and 29 governorships. In some states, like Florida and Texas, Republicans hold overwhelming majorities. This has allowed the bills to move forward. Republicans have tried for years to get photo identification requirements and other changes through legislatures, said Daniel Tokaji, a law professor at Ohio State University and an expert in election law. Similar bills were introduced over the past decade, but were largely derailed in the aftermath of a political battle over the Bush administration’s firing of several United States attorneys whom Republicans had criticized for failing to aggressively investigate voter fraud. “That’s what really killed the momentum of more states’ enacting voter ID laws,” Mr. Tokaji said. “Now with the last elections, with the strong Republican majorities in a lot of states, we’re seeing a rejuvenation of the effort.” Republicans say that large jumps in the immigrant population have also prompted them to act to safeguard elections. “Over the last 20 years, we have seen Florida grow quite rapidly, and we have such a mix of populations,” said State Representative Dennis K. Baxley, the Florida Republican who wrote the law to tighten third-party registration here. “When we fail to protect every ballot, we disenfranchise people who participate legitimately.” Taken together, the state-by-state changes are likely to have an impact on close elections, Mr. Tokaji said. “Remarkably, most of these significant changes are going under the radar,” he added. “A lot of voters are going to be surprised and dismayed when they go to their polling place and find that the rules have changed.” Most of the measures would require people to show a form of official, valid identification to vote. While driver’s licenses are the most common form, voters can also request free photo IDs from the Department of Motor Vehicles or use a passport or military identification, among other things. But Democrats say thousands of people in each state do not have these. The extra step, they add, will discourage some voters who will have to pay to retrieve documents, like birth certificates, for proof to obtain a free card. If voters do not have the proper identification on Election Day, they can cast provisional ballots in most states but must return several days later to a local board of elections office with an ID. A few state bills and laws also shave the number of early voting days, a move that Democrats say would impact Democratic voters once again. In the 2008 presidential election, a majority of those who cast early votes did so for President Obama. In Florida, the number of days is reduced but the number of hours remains the same. Democrats point to state figures showing that there are few proven cases of voter impersonation and question why budget-conscious Republicans would want to spend taxpayer dollars on a problem that is isolated. “There is not one documented case that has been presented to us, and we had numerous hearings,” said State Senator Brad Hutto of South Carolina, a Democrat. “Republicans have to have some reason to do this because it doesn’t sound good to say, ‘We don’t want Latinos or African-Americans voting.’ ” But Republicans counter that detecting and proving voter impersonation is tricky under current law precisely because few states require photo identification. Plus, they add, there is no evidence that the requirement reduces minority participation. In Georgia, where photo IDs became a requirement in 2007, minorities voted in record numbers in 2008 and 2010. Turnout among Hispanic voters jumped 140 percent in the state in 2008 and 42 percent among blacks compared with 2004, a change attributed in part to President Obama’s candidacy. Two years later, in the midterm election, turnout also rose among Hispanics and African-Americans, according to data from the Georgia secretary of state. But with the presidential election campaign season already under way, Democrats say they are taking no chances. The Democratic Governors Association started a Voter Protection Project this month to educate voters and encourage them to speak out against the measures. It also began running online advertisements.

"New York Democratic Rep. Anthony Weiner’s Twitter account produced a shocking photograph Friday night. In a tweet directed to a Washington State woman, the married congressman linked to a photo of a man in underwear with a visible erection. Big Government first reported that the congressman, who is believed to be interested in running for New York City mayor, tweeted the link to his Twitter-connected Yfrog account. Four minutes after the tweet, Weiner complained that his Tivo had mis-recorded a hockey game. Weiner then deleted the lewd tweet and wrote, “Tivo shot. FB hacked. Is my blender gonna attack me next? #TheToasterIsVeryLoyal.” There are no indications that the congressman’s Facebook account was tampered with. The woman who the tweet was directed at deleted her account, and was not originally identified by Big Government. However, the tweet was located independently by other bloggers, who identified the Twitter handle of the woman. The blog Ironic Surrealism found a second account believed to be the same woman. She is a journalism student at Whatcom Community College in Washington State. The woman’s original account tweeted to Weiner on April 9, “I wonder what my boyfriend @RepWeiner is up to right now,” according to a screenshot taken from Topsy by Ironic Surrealism. The account’s cached contents were cleared Saturday. Weiner was married less than one year ago to Huma Abedin, a longtime aide to Hillary Clinton. If the photo turns out to be the congressman, it would come following revelations this year that former New York Republican Rep. Chris Lee sent photos of himself to women found on Craigslist, possibly including transgender women. Fellow Twitter users have dubbed the episode #Weinergate. The congressman has yet to confirm whether he is pictured in the photograph. The photo: The Daily Caller | 1775 Eye Street NW | Suite 1150-290 | Washington, DC 20006"
"A federal judge in Texas has told the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs that it cannot censor a pastor's invocation at a Memorial Day ceremony. The VA had ordered the Rev. Scott Rainey to remove a phrase using Jesus Christ from the prayer, arguing the line excluded other beliefs held by veterans, KHOU-TV in Houston reported. On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Lynn Hughes disagreed, writing the government cannot ""gag citizens when it says it is in the interest of national security, and it cannot do it in some bureaucrat's notion of cultural homogeneity,"" according to a report in the Houston Chronicle.  ~ Are related to Nicole Kidman?, 'cause that would be, like, awesome! TROLL ALERT – this is garbage don't bother viewing, click the report abuse link to get rid of this TROLL Christians started the civil rights movement They started the slavery movement, too. The sanction of slavery in the Bible was the foundation of the last 500 years of misery for African Americans. So I guess Christianity was just cleaning up a mess of its own making. Hey, the Bible advocates selling your daughter into slavery. Oh goody. Can we have an invocation by a minister of the Order of Nine Angels so as to be fair to everyone and by the way make sure the Imam, the Rabbi, and any other deluded wack job gets their opportunity too, otherwise lawsuits will be pending. Oh, and the Wiccans! Let us not forget the Wiccans. They should have been a part of the prayer, too. I don't mind if they mention Jesus, as long as they mention all the others in the same message. I wonder if this would apply to Anwar al-Alwlaki, and American born citizen. Obama wants to kill him just for speaking...I guess only Christians can speak their mind and say their prayers without being killed. I am glad that the censor was lifted. Everyone is trying to wipe Jesus Christ off. Other religions can pray, march, protest and preach when they don't believe in God or Jesus, but the ones that do believe can't. Nobody is trying to ""wipe Jesus off."" We are just trying to get Christians to accept that not everybody believes as you believe. A little respect, ya' know? hALLELUYAH–Yahusha lives! Yahooooooo-sha May the name of Jesus Christ lifted up in America, for He is the Lord of everyone including the Jews. and he wants to torture you forever if you have so much as a whiff of doubt about his existence or do any minor finite transgression. what an azzhole.

"Political Byline This blog is no longer active as of October 31, 2011 Posted onMay 31, 2011May 31, 2011AuthorPatrick Please note: While I have always respected our Military and always will; and I do believe in the Reagan mantra of “Peace through Strength.” I have always and will always questioned the legality the so-called Patriot Act. -Pat Video: Transcript Via The American Conservative: If Americans needed another reminder of why the Democratic Party is absolutely worthless, they got it during last week’s Patriot Act extension debate when Senate Majority leader Harry Reid again behaved exactly like the Bush-era Republicans he once vigorously opposed. In 2005, Reid bragged to fellow Democrats, “We killed the Patriot Act.” Today, Reid says that anyone who opposes the Patriot Act might be responsible for the killing of Americans. Dick Cheney now hears an echo and Americans deserve congressional hearings—as to whether Harry Reid is a sociopath, mere liar, or both. But while Democrats stand pat for Bush Republicanism, the GOP now debates the extent to which it will remain the party of Dubya. Tea Party favorites like Senators Rand Paul and Mike Lee and Congressmen Ron Paul, Justin Amash, Allen West and others, all voted against the Patriot Act. To varying degrees, each of these GOP representatives questioned the act’s effectiveness and legality. But unfortunately, most Republicans still won’t ask any questions. The “War on Terror” that defined and preoccupied Republicans during the Bush era brought with it not only massive government growth and debt, but an unprecedented expansion of extra-constitutional state power, symbolized most famously by the Patriot Act. In the name of national security, government officials could begin wiretapping phones, hacking into email accounts, prying into business records and spying on citizens—all without a warrant and at government officials’ own discretion. Defenders say the Patriot Act did what needed to be done after 9/11. Critics say it did away with the 4th amendment. Let us say both have a point, and that for arguments sake, both Harry Reid and Dick Cheney are correct in arguing that it is sometimes necessary to surrender our liberties for increased security. Is this still true a decade after 9/11? Will it be true two decades after 9/11? How about three? Have the actions of Osama Bin Laden and his fellow terrorists forever altered our Bill of Rights? Allegedly, the default position for conservatives is to distrust the government and defer to the Constitution. Concerning the Patriot Act, too many conservatives blindly trust the government at the expense of the Constitution. This type of thinking mirrors the logic of the Left, in which the constitutionality of a big government program like Obamacare is considered irrelevant due to the severity of the problem at hand. The liberal healthcare ends justify the unconstitutional means. This characteristic mentality of the Left is exactly how most of the Right approaches the Patriot Act—though it is an outright rejection of what most conservatives of any generation have held most dear. Think about it. Conservatives get upset about many things on a regular basis—ACORN corruption, NPR funding, demanding that French fries be renamed “Freedom Fries.” At any given time there is always some new and outrageous rightwing distaste of the week. But most of these controversies are a speck on a gnat’s ass compared to the damage done to the Constitution by the Patriot Act. For genuine constitutional conservatives, something like NPR funding is undoubtedly wrong but ultimately trivial and peripheral—while the protection of the Bill of Rights is crucial and integral. If George Washington or Thomas Jefferson were alive today, are we to believe that they would be more outraged that: A. The federal government helps fund public radio. B. The federal government snoops on citizens without restraint. Those who answered A. truly don’t understand the mindset of the men who founded this country. A Republican critic of mine once asked me during a radio broadcast “Jack, can you show me where any American has been harmed due to the Patriot Act?” I replied, “Can you show me where any American has been harmed by Wikileaks?” The caller said he couldn’t, but stated that he believed private individuals shouldn’t haven’t access to private government documents. The gentleman was basically saying that whether or not Wikileaks has hurt anyone to date is irrelevant—the whistleblower outfit shouldn’t be trusted with such power to begin with. I argue the same is true of the federal government. So did the Founding Fathers. That’s why they wrote the 4th amendment. The entire reason we have a written charter like the Constitution is to specify the enumerated powers that define the hard parameters of our federal government. Among those powers is national defense and security. But much of what we call “defense” is anything but. Similarly, a total police state could undoubtedly provide much better security, though few Americans would desire a country so void of liberty. After all, most Americans can barely tolerate the way the federal government handles air travel these days. When Ronald Reagan said there was nothing closer to eternal life on this earth than a government program he could have easily been describing the Patriot Act. When Barry Goldwater said that “extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice” he could have easily been describing the minority of Republicans who now at least question the Patriot Act. When James Madison wrote, “Of all the enemies to public liberty, war is, perhaps, the most to be dreaded because it comprises and develops the germ of every other,” he could have easily been describing our current state of perpetual war that now gives seemingly permanent life to the Patriot Act. If the “War on Terror” is a perpetual war—as so many politicians readily contend—have we now permanently given up our liberties? If terrorists really do “hate us for our freedoms” is the best method of defeating them to permanently surrender our historic freedoms? And if so, who is really winning the War on Terror? Us or the terrorists? By the very nature of their philosophy, conservatives are supposed to question their government. And given the very nature of our Constitution, this is precisely how the Founders would expect any true patriot to act. —- Jack Hunter began his punditry career in the late 1990’s when a friend and popular alternative rock disc jockey agreed to let Jack air his political views during the afternoon drive on 96 Wave (96.1 WAVF) in Charleston, South Carolina. Creating the moniker the “Southern Avenger,” which was borrowed from popular 90’s conservative talk radio host Ken “The Black Avenger” Hamblin, Jack assumed an anonymous super hero/ pro-wrestler persona, and entertained FM rock audiences with his antics and conservative political views until his departure from 96 Wave in 2007. In 2007, Jack began working for WTMA 1250 AM talk radio in Charleston and began writing a column for the Charleston City Paper, that city’s premiere alternative weekly. Jack also began producing his popular video podcasts around this time, and today his You Tube Channel has received over two million views. Today, you can find Jack’s videos and columns as part of “TAC TV” at The American Conservative magazine (www.amconmag.com). Jack is a frequent guest host for The Mike Church Show on Sirius/XM’s Patriot channel and is a frequent guest on “The Savage Nation” with nationally syndicated talk radio host Michael Savage. His writing has appeared at The American Spectator, Lewrockwell.com, CampaignforLiberty.com and in Young American Revolution, the official magazine of the youth activist organization Young Americans for Liberty, to which he is also a contributing editor.

"Anyone who follows politics knows that the mainstream media has two sets of rules: one set for conservatives and another set for liberals. Conservatives spend most of their time correcting smears and trying to explain to the public what they really believe. Liberals, on the other hand, can count on the press to hide their unpopular beliefs and put the best spin possible on everything they do. This is why you often hear Republicans say, ""Imagine what they'd say if a Democrat had said that,"" while you almost never hear Democrats say, ""Imagine what they'd say if a Republican had said that."" Those two separate sets of rules shape how politicians behave, how they're perceived, and the issues that they spend most of their time talking about. In Barack Obama's case, the media would be focusing on an entirely different set of issues if he were a Republican. 1) This guy is way too stupid to be President of the United States! Poor Dan Quayle was forever branded as stupid for misspelling the word potato. It's not often noted, however, that the card that he was given by the school had misspelled the word. Then there's Obama, the man who stammers without a teleprompter, the guy who won't release his college records. How does Quayle's gaffe compare to Obama thinking there are 57 states? Duhr! How about Obama walking into a window at the White House? Duhr, duhr! What about signing a guest book 2008 in 2011? Duhr, duhr, duhr! Obama's stupidity would be a staple of late night talk show jokes if he were a Republican. 2) Obama's an amateurish cowboy who's wrecking our image around the world! Obama has made Jimmy Carter look like a foreign policy mastermind since he got into the White House. Sure, he gets credit for getting Osama Bin Laden. When the military walked up to Obama and said, ""We know where Bin Laden is. Can we go get him?"" he made the ""gutsy call"" to say ""yes."" Of course, he's also damaged our relations with Britain, Israel, and Pakistan. He's screwed things up so badly with Pakistan that it's endangering the war effort in Afghanistan. His administration gave Russia a ""reset button"" that actually said ""overcharge."" The fact you probably don't even know about how badly we screwed things up in Honduras is telling. Then, there's Obama's impulsive and bizarre insertion of the American military into a civil war in Libya. If Obama were a Republican, the media would be telling us we need to get a Democrat in office to repair the damage caused by Obama's blundering. 3) Obama's going to bankrupt the country by giving our money to his corporate cronies! Remember when the media talked about the size of the deficit all the time? Remember when we heard about Halliburton and Blackwater on a daily basis? Oh, yes, that was when we had a Republican President. Now we've got the most wasteful spender in the history of our country in the White House, we're in danger of going bankrupt, and tens of billions in tax dollars have been transferred to corporations that have given money to the Democratic Party. Now suddenly the ""fierce watchdogs of the press"" have become completely complacent about corporate cronyism and the very real possibility that our country will turn into Greece within the next decade. 4) He's the job-killing, gas-price-raising, economy-wrecking President! Can you imagine the stories we'd see every day if a Republican were President? We'd have daily stories on the people left homeless by the “Obamaconomy,” human interest stories about single mothers who can't feed their kids anymore, and we'd hear from experts every day about how Obama is killing jobs, raising costs at the pump, and destroying the economy with his policies. Remember how the press used to slip a reference to George Bush speaking in front of the ""Mission Accomplished"" banner into every story about Iraq? Well, they'd do the same thing with Barack Obama's empty promises about how his 1.1 trillion dollar stimulus would ""save or create jobs."" Can you hear them now? ""So, how's the economy looking? Gas prices still high? Are we seeing any impact of the stimulus yet? How many jobs have been 'saved or created’ -- and that's a meaningless, made up phrase by the way...” 5) Obama's not an authentic black man. Black conservatives have their ""blackness"" challenged all the time, often by privileged white liberals who don't know any black people other than the ones who clean their mansions. If Barack Obama were a Republican, he'd be called an Oreo, a half-white house slave, and a white man pretending to be black. On the upside for the Clintons, Democrats would still be calling Bill Clinton the first (and only) black President. 6) He's an arrogant jerk who cares about no one but himself! Vacation, golf, shooting hoops -- the fun never stops for Barack Obama. It would be great if the rest of us could take that much time off, but our jobs keep us too busy. It's also fantastic that Obama finally went to Joplin, Missouri. If you're wondering why it took so long, well, they didn't have a golf course cleared until now. Have you heard that some Republicans have taken to calling Barack Obama ""Mr. Spock"" because of his ""cool"" demeanor? Yeah, well, I'm pretty sure Mr. Spock never wore mom jeans, he could talk without a teleprompter, and Bones was around to tell him, ""Damnit Spock, it's not logical for the President to ignore the BP oil spill for so long. So, get your Vulcan behind in gear and do something!"" .com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis. "

"Sign In Manage Newsletters Shameless politicians use 9/11 to lecture America about “unity” Biden’s forced COVID-19 vaccine attack on minorities Dems’ totalitarian overreach threatens Americans’ livelihood NEW YORK (AP) - A union has filed a federal complaint against the troubled New York City Opera, saying the company’s plans to move out of Lincoln Center after 45 years undermines the labor rights of the singers, dancers and stage crew members who work for the company. The American Guild of Musical Artists says the opera’s move to a smaller venue and a shorter schedule will mean less work for union members, who are usually guaranteed a certain number of work weeks per year. It filed a complaint on Thursday with the National Labor Relations Board saying the opera should have negotiated any move with the union. “They have a legal obligation to bargain and give us all their information,” Gordon said. “They can’t just decide, `I’m going into business somewhere else, find me if you can.’” TOP STORIES Senate Dems to force vote on bill overriding new elections laws in GOP-led states CNN poll: America turns irate, glum 'No SALT, no deal': Vulnerable Dems threaten revolt unless $3.5T bill cuts blue-states taxes The union represents about 200 workers at the opera, including about 50 choristers and 10 production workers. The union’s complaint says the planned move will have the effect of “chilling the union and its members in the exercise of their rights.” A spokeswoman for the company, Maggie McKeon, said Thursday the filing was without merit. Last week, general manager George Steel said the opera simply cannot afford to operate at Lincoln Center anymore. City Opera has a reputation for mounting bold new productions and cultivating hot talents like Placido Domingo, Renee Fleming and Beverly Sills. But the company has struggled in recent years. Its endowment has shrunk from $55 million to $9 million, audits obtained by The Associated Press show, and it has a projected deficit of $5 million this year. It announced last week it was moving out of Lincoln Center, the landmark complex of concert halls that is also home to the Metropolitan Opera, the New York City Ballet, the Juilliard School of Music and other organizations. The company also said it will do only three full-scale operas next season instead of five. ___ Online:  "
"Sign In Manage Newsletters Shameless politicians use 9/11 to lecture America about “unity” Biden’s forced COVID-19 vaccine attack on minorities Dems’ totalitarian overreach threatens Americans’ livelihood Republicans, once ecstatic about the energy generated by the 2009 anti-spending tea party uprising, are growing increasingly uneasy about the impact in 2012 of a movement that seems beyond the control of anyone, including its own leaders. “The nature of the tea party and liberty movement is that there really are very few, if any, authoritative spokespersons,” said Ryan Call, Colorado GOP chairman. “The fact that the grass-roots movement is somewhat leaderless is one of its strengths, but it also makes the movement susceptible to individuals or groups co-opting the ‘tea party label in inappropriate and damaging ways, like we saw in the May 24 New York 26th [Congressional] District special election.” TOP STORIES Senate Dems to force vote on bill overriding new elections laws in GOP-led states CNN poll: America turns irate, glum 'No SALT, no deal': Vulnerable Dems threaten revolt unless $3.5T bill cuts blue-states taxes In interviews with The Washington Times, Republicans said they see two problems ahead. One is that Democrats benefit from fake tea party candidates siphoning crucial votes from a Republican candidate. The other is the ongoing tendency of the Republican establishment to invite tea party rebellions by picking more-liberal candidates, such as Dede Scozzafava, who lost another Republican-leaning New York congressional district in a special election in 2009. In last week’s New York election, Democrat Kathy Hochul upset Republican Jane Corwin, 47 percent to 43 percent. Millionaire Jack Davis drained votes from Mrs. Corwin by spending $3 million of his own money to gather enough petition signatures to get himself on the ballot identified as the “tea party” candidate, despite a history of running as a Democrat and his liberal stances on spending and other key tea party issues. Some Republican operatives blamed the confusion on the failure of local tea party groups to unite behind Mrs. Corwin and to expose Mr. Davis as a fake. “The local Republican Party in that district should have reached out to tea party types to make sure Davis, who got 9 percent of the vote, didn’t get the traction he needed in order to get that 9 percent,” longtime Republican campaign consultant Kenny Klinge said. Mr. Klinge predicted the tea party “will be more of hindrance than an asset in 2012 if the Republican leadership doesn’t reach out to the tea party.” Rus Thompson, a New York tea party coordinator, said the organizations did unite to use their email lists to expose Mr. Davis as a fraud. “But we don’t have any money to put out expensive mailers or run TV ads, and I was so frustrated with local news media that kept portraying Davis as the tea party candidate,” Mr. Thompson said. But New York state GOP Chairman Ed Cox denied that. “All the tea party groups were not united against Davis, and Davis suppressed some a portion of our vote that is concerned about jobs going abroad,” Mr. Cox said. House Speaker John A. Boehner worsened matters, some Republican figures said, by failing to mention at a fundraising event in the district that Mrs. Corwin was the only tea-party-endorsed candidate and that Mr. Davis was not the real tea party candidate. “Boehner was in town, but didnt tell the 500 people at the Corwin fundraiser she is endorsed by the tea party and is the real conservative in this race,” Mr. Thompson said. Mr. Boehner’s office disputed that characterization, saying the speaker clearly dubbed Mrs. Corwin the “one conservative candidate” in the race. And RNC spokesman Sean Spicer said the RNC did all it could, from “spending money and putting boots on the ground to making it clear to voters in the district that Davis was not the tea party-endorsed candidate — Corwin was.” Others were blaming Mrs. Corwin’s own weakness as a candidate, noting that she sabotaged her appeal to the party base and independents alike by first backing, then backing away from, Rep. Paul Ryan’s Medicare partial-privatization plan. “Ultimately, it was her that lost us the 26th District,” one GOP official said. The problem lies in all of the above, some Republicans and tea party leaders say. Mr. Boehner didn’t mention the tea party because, thanks to its disorganized nature, there is always the risk that it could blow up in the Republicans’ face. Some tea party leaders pin their hopes on the educational value of experience in avoiding Democratic shenanigans next year, even though the groups don’t have the financial means or discipline to fight off self-serving usurpers and Democratic saboteurs. Andrew Ian Dodge, a Maine Tea Party Patriots leader, is “sure other jurisdictions will not be so daft to allow a lifelong Democrat who ran three times as a Democrat for the office to run as a tea party candidate,” referring to Mr. Davis. Although Democrats will “will try to replicate the success of ‘NY26 where able, the tea party movement is getting wise to less-than-genuine usurpers, after some recent experiences,” Mr. Dodge said. The Republican Party in some states, including New York, let county chairmen pick the special-election candidates, some of whom have proved to be philosophically inconsistent. In other cases, the state parties have to go with the available candidates, not the ones they wish they could have. All this opens Republicans to Democratic sabotage. “Davis wanted to run as a Republican, but seven of our county chairs didn’t think he was a good candidate,” New York GOP Chairman Ed Cox told The Washington Times. “So they went with Jane Corwin.” Many conservative Republicans hold on to the belief that its the candidate, rather than shenanigans by Democrats or disgruntled Republican mavericks, that wins or loses an election. These Republicans say there’s no perfect defense against spoilers, but the Republicans invite trouble every time they engineer the selection of a candidate of uncertain philosophical persuasion instead of letting the party rank and file pick the nominee. “As long as the party doesn’t hand-pick candidates or play favorites, there won’t be as much of a threat that you’ll get a spoiler,” says Amy Frederick, president of the 60-Plus Association. “The establishment vs. grass roots is still very much alive, and there is always a chance of a spoiler getting in, but ensuring that all factions had input into the candidate nominated by the GOP will minimize those third-party/spoiler candidates.” "
"In contrast to what many believe, I do not support political parties. I support and vehemently defend policies that make sense, and attack those that don't.In case you did not know that, I am going to surprise you with a blast of Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney who is pandering to the Iowa farmers with a message ""I Support the Subsidy of Ethanol"".On his first trip back to the nation's first voting state as a soon-to-be declared presidential candidate, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney reaffirmed his support for federal ethanol subsidies -- an always important campaign issue in Iowa that figures to take on an even more central role in the divided GOP field.""I support the subsidy of ethanol,"" Romney told a potential voter after an event here was cut short by a fire alarm. ""I believe ethanol is an important part of our energy solution in this country.""Support for ethanol subsidies has long been considered a political necessity for candidates who want to succeed in the Iowa caucuses, but former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty tested that maxim on Monday during his official campaign announcement here.""The truth about federal energy subsidies, including federal subsidies for ethanol, is that they have to be phased out,"" Pawlenty said. ""We need to do it gradually. We need to do it fairly. But we need to do it.""Pawlenty was widely praised in fiscally conservative circles for taking a stance against the subsidies, which cost taxpayers about $5 billion in 2010, while former House Speaker Newt Gingrich has been singled out for criticism by influential conservative media outlets, including the Wall Street Journal editorial board, for his vocal support of subsidized ethanol.Romney supported ethanol subsidies during his unsuccessful 2008 presidential run, in which he largely banked on winning the Iowa caucuses but finished a disappointing second to former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. Political PanderingDave, a friend of mine, sent me the above article and said ""what a whore"".By the way, Dave is a Republican. He voted for McCain in the last election (I wrote in Ron Paul). We need more Republicans like Dave willing to voice their criticism because that is the only way we are going to get change.Here's the deal. Either Romney is a whore or he is ignorant. He could be both. Romney may be far better than Obama, but that is beside the point.The point is ethanol from corn makes no sense. Ethanol from corn costs energy to produce and is only viable because of government subsidies. Ethanol from sugar cane makes sense, but the US has tariffs on Brazilian ethanol in order to support inefficient, energy wasting ethanol from corn.Remove Tariffs, Legalize HempWant to lower gas prices? Then remove tariffs on ethanol.If you want biofuels, then legalize hemp.Hemp needs no fertilizer, its fiber is softer than cotton, its seeds high in oil content, and it grows on poor soil.Those are admirable properties. Does that make hemp viable for biofuels? I suspect so, but to be truthful, I just don't know. What I do know is if we get government subsidies out of the way and end needless regulation, the free market will find a way.Get Rid of Big GovernmentRepublican candidates ought to be supporting free market, small government policies. Instead, it is very disheartening to see Romney whoring Iowa voters on the same big government subsidy side as president Obama.Mike ""Mish""  Here To Scroll Thru My Recent Post List"
"By the time America elected Barack Obama, this historian would see, it was already on the way down. Were he to simultaneously examine the rise of the welfare state, he would notice a telltale trend: As socialism dug deeper into the soul of America, America's pioneering spirit waned. Americans stopped wanting to open new frontiers -- to get there first. Rather than take bold risks and settle new realms, Americans had settled down to wait for the government's largesse. Fifty years ago last week, a Democratic president gave a speech to a joint session of Congress in which he expressed a different view. In that speech, John F. Kennedy called for Americans to send a man to the moon and bring him back within the 1960s, and to do so not only as an expression of the superiority of freedom over tyranny but as a necessity for maintaining freedom over tyranny. Six weeks before Kennedy gave this speech, Russian cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin had become the first man to orbit the Earth. Kennedy was clearly disturbed by the propaganda impact this had for Soviet communism. ""(I)f we are to win the battle that is now going on around the world between freedom and tyranny, the dramatic achievements in space which occurred in recent weeks should have made clear to us all, as did the Sputnik in 1957, the impact of this adventure on the minds of men everywhere, who are attempting to make a determination of which road they should take,"" he told Congress. Kennedy was also concerned about whether freedom or tyranny would dominate realms beyond the Earth. ""Space is open to us now; and our eagerness to share its meaning is not governed by the efforts of others,"" said Kennedy. ""We go into space because whatever mankind must undertake, free men must fully share."" Having framed the challenge this way, Kennedy said, ""I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth."" The historian 2,000 years from now will see, as we can see now, that the America of the 1960s did send men to the moon and back. The historian will see that the Soviet Union collapsed two decades later. But then what will he see? He will see that the U.S. space program stopped being a U.S. space program. Rather than serve to make America first in space, it served as a platform for globaloney. Americans eventually could not even launch their own rockets to bring their own people to and from ... the International Space Station. They relied on Russians. He will see that even as the U.S. space program declined, U.S. government spending rose as percentage of gross domestic product, pushing past 25 percent in the Obama years. What he will see climbing into orbit is not U.S. spacecraft, but the U.S debt. In the first half the 21st century, he will see the U.S. government borrowing tens of trillions -- not to defend the nation against foreign enemies or open new frontiers, but to finance massive entitlement programs. Last week, former moon astronauts Neil Armstrong, Jim Lovell and Gene Cernan wrote an op-ed in USA Today asking: ""Is Obama Grounding JFK's Space Legacy?"" Obama's 2011 budget proposal, they noted, defunded NASA's Constellation program, which called for returning men to the moon and eventually sending men to Mars. While Congress restored funding, the former astronauts pointed out, Obama's 2012 budget proposal reduced it again. ""Today, under the announced objectives (of the Obama administration), the voyage is over,"" wrote Armstrong, Lovell and Cernan. ""John F. Kennedy would have been sorely disappointed."" But will Obama's vision -- or lack of it -- prevail? Former astronaut Jack Schmitt -- who on Dec. 11, 1972, emerged from the lunar module in the Valley of Taurus-Littrow to became the last man to step onto the moon -- told me last week that NASA should be phased out so it can be replaced with a new National Space Exploration Administration (NSEA). ""I think the vast majority (of Americans) recognize that the United States represents liberty and freedom on this planet, and if it is not competitive in space, well then, liberty and freedom are in further jeopardy than they are for other reasons,"" said Schmitt, who also served as a Republican senator from New Mexico and as chairman of NASA's advisory council. ""The NSEA would be given the charter to explore deep space, which includes the moon, to settle the moon and ultimately potentially to settle Mars, and to help the private sector utilize the resources, the energy resources in particular, that we find on the moon,"" said Schmitt. Schmitt, like me, is an admirer of the historian Frederick Jackson Turner, who argued that the unique success of freedom and representative government in America is tied to our pioneering heritage and the pioneering spirit it engendered. Let's keep that spirit alive -- here and on the next frontier. .com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis. "
"“My fellow citizens, the American presidency is not supposed to be a journey of personal discovery.” — Sarah Palin Since he has been elected, Barack Obama has been like a four year old wearing water wings and desperately trying to reach the edge of the pool. In other words, he has been completely out of his depth. Who could have known that giving soaring speeches about “hope” and “change” while voting “present” on the tough issues wouldn’t be enough preparation for the most important job on planet earth — oh wait, millions of Americans knew that and pointed it out at every opportunity. Unfortunately, the media was too busy obsessing over Sarah Palin’s wardrobe and parody songs on the Rush Limbaugh show to actually consider whether or not a man whose biggest accomplishment was winning a Democratic primary against Hillary Clinton was qualified to be President. Of course, we can debate Obama’s ideological decisions all day. Does the country need socialized medicine? Should he have pursued that staggeringly expensive stimulus program? Has he been applying enough pressure on Iran? The answers to those questions are no, no, and no — but, there’s a more important question we need to consider: does Barack Obama know what he’s doing? Early on, the Obama Administration made a lot of foolish mistakes. Obama selected numerous tax cheats for his cabinet. They gave the Russians a button that was supposed to say “reset,” but that actually said “overcharge.” They gave our best allies the Brits, 25 DVDs of American movie classics, that were not only wildly inappropriate, but wouldn’t even play in the their DVD players. Unfortunately, those early gaffes have not only continued, they’ve begun to have more serious policy implications. Trending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet 1) What are we trying to do in Honduras?: After Fidel Castro wannabe, Manuel Zelaya, started trying to engineer a rigged vote to overthrow democracy in Honduras, the rest of the government there sprang into action and bounced him right out of the country. Bizarrely, the Obama administration sided with Zelaya and against Democracy in that nation. Eventually, by making it known that they wouldn’t recognize the results of a new election, the Obama Administration seemed to have Honduras right where they wanted them: they appeared to be on the brink of putting Zelaya back in power. Puzzlingly, the Obama Administration then switched course on a dime and made it known that they’d accept the results of the election whether Zelaya was back in charge or not. In light of the change in American policy, Honduras went ahead with their elections without giving power back to Zelaya. There was no explanation for the Obama Administration’s original position, beyond catering to leftist thugs like Hugo Chavez, and no explanation of their radical shift at the last minute. If you can figure out what they were trying to accomplish, you should tell Obama. He’s probably still trying to figure it out. 2) Russia’s missile defense date dupe: It’s bad enough that Barack Obama, in a display of cowardice that would make Neville Chamberlain wretch, unhesitatingly tossed the Poles and Czechs over-the-side on missile defense in an effort to appease Russia. Keep in mind that when we first went into Iraq, Poland was one of only three other nations to actually put their troops in harm’s way to help us. Their repayment for that act of friendship and loyalty? We pulled back from building missile defense in their nation and made the announcement on the 70th anniversary of Poland’s invasion by Russia in return for…well, nobody seems to know. There was an unmistakable message that Russia wanted to send to the small Western European nations on its borders by making the announcement on that date: It was, “America can’t help you now. Russia owns you.” Their message was sent with Obama’s help as once again, he was played for a fool. Since then, Obama has backpeddled in an effort to fix the damage his bungling caused in the first place. It’s almost as if Obama has no coherent strategy, no idea what he’s doing, and is so far over his head that he doesn’t know which way is up. But, it’s couldn’t be that because if it was, Chris Matthews and the New York Times would be talking about it on a daily basis — right? 3) Putting Khalid Sheikh Mohammed on trial in New York: No one seems to be able to give a coherent explanation for the decision making process behind this. Other terrorists are being put on trial at military tribunals, so why not Khalid Sheikh Mohammed? Why put someone through the American system of justice when both the President and Attorney General are publicly assuring everyone that no matter what happens, he can’t be found innocent and released? You think putting KSM in front of a military tribunal, where at least, theoretically he could be found innocent looks bad? Well now, we’re risking intelligence secrets getting out, increasing the risk of a terrorist attack on New York, and making it possible KSM might be acquitted on a technicality for a hearing that makes the greatest system of justice in the world look like a show trial cooked up by North Korea. 4) Cash for Clunkers: In a nutshell, the cash for clunkers program involved borrowing billions from the Chinese to incentivize Americans to destroy their working cars, in order to buy brand new foreign cars. Although it’s debatable how accurate their data is, according to the transportation department, 4 out of the top 5 models bought in the program were made by foreign car companies. Moreover, after the program ended, predictably, the sales of new cars dropped considerably, because the program didn’t create new demand so much as cause people to buy a few months earlier than they would have anyway. In other words, not only did the program fritter away 3 billion dollars in borrowed money, it led to the destruction of more than a quarter-of-a-million functional cars that were bought and paid for by the government and could have been given to the poor or charity. The Obama administration’s reaction to this debacle? They want to create a cash for appliances program. Will they ever, ever, ever learn anything? 5) Why all the bowing?: Most Americans find the idea that they should bow to another person offensive and they find it even more galling when their President does it. It’s almost an insult by proxy. If even your leader is willing to admit he’s inferior, what does it say about you? Obama seemed to realize this mistake, albeit after the fact, when he bowed to the Saudi King. Weirdly, even though many Americans actually saw Obama bow on video, the White House simply denied that it happened. How much audacity do you need to lie about something that tens of millions of Americans have seen with their own eyes? Even after that experience, Obama went on, in a grotesque, servile fashion, to bow to both the Emperor of Japan and the Chinese PM. It was an humiliating display that quite frankly, made many people embarrassed for him as a man and slightly ashamed that our nation had elected such a weakling. 17SHARES Share Tweet Comment Now 0 “My fellow citizens, the American presidency is not supposed to be a journey of personal discovery.” — Sarah Palin Since he has been elected, Barack Obama has been like a four year old wearing water wings and desperately trying to reach the edge of the pool.

Prof Jones, who lectures at University College London, is likely to find himself at the centre of controversy in the wake of the comments. Similar remarks made by Phil Woolas, a Labour environment minister, in 2008 resulted in calls for him to be sacked from the government. Prof Jones, who writes for the ’s science pages, told an audience at the Hay Festival: “There may be some evidence that cousins marrying one another can be harmful. “It is common in the Islamic world to marry your brother’s daughter, which is actually closer than marrying your cousin. “We should be concerned about that as there can be a lot of hidden genetic damage. Children are much more likely to get two copies of a damaged gene.” He added: “Bradford is very inbred. There is a huge amount of cousins marrying each other there.” Research in Bradford has found that babies born to Pakistani women are twice as likely to die in their first year as babies born to white mothers, with genetic problems linked to inbreeding identified as a “significant” cause. Studies have found that within the city, more than 70 per cent of marriages are between relations, with more than half involving first cousins. Separate studies have found that while British Pakistanis make up three per cent of all births, they account for one in three British children born with genetic illnesses. Prof Jones also said that incest was more common than is often realised in every part of society, adding that it had been particular prevalent among royalty and suggested it is still ­continuing. “Royal families are the human equivalent of fruit flies because they do all the sexual experiments you can think of and there are some examples of inbreeding. “Royalty did it to keep the heritage within the family line. “Inbreeding doesn’t apply particularly to our own royal family, but there is some.” He explained that Prince Charles and Diana could both be traced back to Edward I, with Prince Charles being able to do this through 3,000 “lines” – overlapping connections between people in his family tree – and his former wife being able to do it through 4,000, making the Princess of Wales “from stronger aristocratic heritage” than her husband. “Their parents had much ancestry in common,” he said. “We are all more incestuous than we realise. “In Northern Ireland lots of people share the same surname which suggests a high level of inbreeding. “There’s a lot of surname diversity in London but if you look at the Outer Herbrides there are rather fewer surnames in relation to the number of people.”"

"Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Ben Shapiro writes in ""Primetime Propaganda"" that the industry's elite use broadcast to ""shape America in their own leftist image."" By Lindsay Powers Author and lawyer Ben Shapiro accuses Hollywood of rampant liberal bias in his new book Primetime Propaganda. He says the industry’s elite uses broadcast to “shape America in their own leftist image.” “I was shocked by the openness of the Hollywood crowd when it came to admitting anti-conservative discrimination inside the industry,” Shapiro told The U.K. Independent on Sunday. “They weren’t ashamed of it. In fact, some were actually proud of it.” One of the 70 people he interviewed was Friends co-creator Marta Kauffman, who told Shapiro she hired a “bunch of liberals” to “put out there what we believe.” That included casting Newt Gingrich’s lesbian sister to play a preacher at a lesbian wedding on the show. “When we did the lesbian wedding, we knew there was going to be some flack,” says Kauffman in the book. “I have to say, when we cast Candice Gingrich as the minister of that wedding, there was a bit of a ‘f–k you’ in it to the right-wing, directly.” Vin DiBona agrees Hollywood has a liberal bias, saying, “I’m happy about it actually.” He says MacGyver, which he produced, has an anti-gun agenda. “That was the whole premise of the program, that MacGuyver used his brain power and skill and science, and solved all the difficulties through ingenuity. No guns, no knives,” he says. MASH had a pacifist agenda, says co-creator and director Gene Reynolds. “We wanted to point out the wastefulness of war,” he says in the book. Happy Days writer Bill Bickley admits the show had a “whole subtext” against the Vietnam War. “If you really look for it, you can find it,” he says. Shapiro is the hardest on Sesame Street, accusing creators of trying to brainwash children. One of the show’s founding executives, Mike Dann, says, the longtime kids series “was not made for the sophisticated or the middle class.” “Sesame Street tried to tackle divorce, tackled ‘peaceful conflict resolution’ in the aftermath of 9/11 and had [gay actor] Neil Patrick Harris on the show playing the subtly-named ‘fairy shoeperson’,” writes Shapiro, who also notes Grover breaking bread with a hippy and the socioeconomic and racial undertones in Oscar living in a garbage can. Shapiro says it was easy to get people to open up to him. “There was a certain amount of stereotyping on their part in granting the interview,” he told the Independent. “Many probably assumed that with a name like Shapiro and a Harvard Law credential, there was no need to Google me: I would have to be a leftist. In Hollywood, talking to a Jew with a Harvard Law baseball cap is like talking to someone wearing an Obama pin.” Shaprio defends his findings as well: “It’s not paranoid to speak the truth. Hollywoodites admit openly to messaging their product, and to their scorn for conservative Americans. I’m just reporting what they told me.” Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Send us a tip using our anonymous form."
"WASHINGTON (CBSNewYork) — Congressman Anthony Weiner said Thursday he’s finished talking about the lewd photo sent from his Twitter account. But he still wouldn’t say whether he’s the one in the picture. So CBS 2 political reporter Marcia Kramer decided to go to his office on Capitol Hill to try to get you some answers. You’ll never believe what happened. Kramer tried to get an interview with the six-term New York Democrat and as a result had the cops called on her. Kramer walked in to Weiner’s office, announced herself as being from CBS 2 in New York City and said she’d like to see the congressman. Those few words created quite the stir. Doors slammed and people pretended she wasn’t there. Finally, brave press secretary David Arnold arrived. The following is the exchange Kramer had with him: Kramer: “All I want is for him to say something to his constituents, the people who have to vote for him.” Arnold: “I don’t think you can say he hasn’t said anything to his constituents. He spoke for nine hours yesterday. Kramer: “But not to anyone in New York. You know, this is the sort of in-the-bunker in the capitol, not to anyone in New York.” After Kramer left Weiner’s office, his staff called the Capitol Police. Police officers asked for identification. One cop told Kramer that if she went into Weiner’s office and didn’t leave if she was asked, she could be arrested. “If you go to an office and are asked to leave, you can be placed under arrest,” Officer Michael Miller said. Kramer responded, “But I wasn’t refusing to leave.” Kramer was never asked to leave Weiner’s office, but the fact that the cops were called is a clear sign that the stress of this so-called “Weinergate” controversy is taking its toll. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor became the first member of House leadership to go after Weiner. “I think the American people are sick of seeing their elected officials tied up in scandals like this. My advice would be to come clean and clear it up. Perhaps he’s trying, but I know there’s a lot of explaining going on, without a lot of clarity,” Cantor said. Weiner, himself, had little to say Thursday. “Today I’m going to have to head back to work doing a job I’m paid to do,” he said. He refused to answer any questions and walked back into his office. The Congressman adamantly denies tweeting a suggestive photo of a man in grey underwear to a 21-year-old woman, but was far less clear about the photo’s origin when pressed by CBS congressional correspondent Nancy Cordes. Cordes: “Congressman, I think the main question people are asking is, was that a picture of you?” Weiner: “Well the main question that a lot of people are asking is did I send the photograph. I did not, this was a prank, a hoax.” Cordes: “So it sounds like it was a photo of you.” Weiner: “Well we’re going to try to find out exactly what happened.” Weiner is also dodging questions about why he followed the Washington State College student on Twitter, along with a bevy of other young women, refusing to answer reporters’ questions about whether he ever sent her private messages. “Look, I’m not going to get into how I communicate with people on social media,” he said. “Did I send someone a note that says, ‘thank you for following me, tune in for the future.’ I don’t want to open the door to that.” He said whatever the communication, none of it was inappropriate. But he’s stopped short of calling for an investigation. On The Early Show Thursday, CBS news legal analyst Jack Ford, said the congressman may have a good reason for not involving authorities. “It’s not against the law to lie to the media. It’s not against the law to lie to constituents. It is against the law to lie to law enforcement,” said Ford. “So if I’m a lawyer on a case like this, I’m going to be real careful before I let my client talk to law enforcement.” Another expert told Kramer the ongoing questions could hurt his political ambitions. “This is something that is not going to go away. It is part of his legacy whether he likes it or not,” said crisis management guru Richard Auletta of Auletta & Assoc. If Weiner thinks this is going away anytime soon, he’s got another thing coming. There were dozens of journalists on permanent stakeout outside his door all day. The damage to Weiner’s political future is yet to be determined. What do you think? Let us know in our comments section."
"PRINCETON, NJ -- Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich's Positive Intensity Score dropped to 6 in the two weeks spanning May 16-29, down from 11 for May 9-22. Gingrich's current Positive Intensity Score is his lowest to date, off from a score as high as 19 earlier this year, and among the lowest for any Republican candidate  is tracking. Gingrich's current Positive Intensity Score is based on the difference between the 13% of Republicans giving him a strongly favorable rating and the 7% giving him a strongly unfavorable rating, among those who recognize him. His score this week is slightly above Gary Johnson's 4, which is the lowest for anyone tested, and slightly below Jon Huntsman's 8. Herman Cain and Michele Bachmann continue to earn the highest Positive Intensity Scores, at 25% and 21%, respectively. Below these two, several other candidates have Positive Intensity Scores in the 14 to 16 range, including two of the best-known candidates, Sarah Palin and Mitt Romney, and two who are less well-known -- Tim Pawlenty and Rick Santorum. Gingrich's Overall Unfavorables Now Highest for Anyone Measured Overall, 61% of Republicans who recognize Gingrich now view him favorably, while 32% view him unfavorably. This gives Gingrich the second-lowest favorable and the highest unfavorable rating of any candidate  is tracking. Name Recognition Gains Are Slow for Candidates and Potential Candidates Several less-well-known Republicans have gained in name recognition over the past two months, but remain well below the leaders on this dimension. Cain, Pawlenty, and Huntsman -- the first two of whom are now officially announced candidates for the GOP nomination -- have made the largest gains. Bachmann, Johnson, and Ron Paul are the only other candidates to have gained name ID, even marginally. Name recognition is less of a problem for Palin, Gingrich, and Romney. All three are known by more than 8 in 10 Republicans. Overall, the group of announced and potential GOP candidates continues to break down into three groups: the very well-known -- Palin, Gingrich, Romney, and Paul; those with mid-level recognition -- Bachmann, Pawlenty, and Santorum; and the less well-known -- Cain, Huntsman, and Johnson. Implications Campaign activity is increasing among candidates and potential candidates in the race for the 2012 GOP presidential nomination. Palin is currently taking a highly visible bus tour across a number of Eastern states; Huntsman has been campaigning in New Hampshire; Romney is set to officially announce his candidacy this week in New Hampshire; and Pawlenty is campaigning and appearing on the weekend political talk shows. At this point, a number of candidates face a key challenge: to become better known among Republicans. Two Republicans who have announced their candidacies -- Cain and Pawlenty -- have in fact made gains in name recognition, but still remain far behind better-known Republicans, such as Palin, Romney, and Gingrich. Huntsman, who has not announced but who has been actively seeking out potential primary voters in New Hampshire, has also gained in name recognition but is still largely unknown. Gingrich's loss of positive positioning in Republicans' eyes is the main finding relating to the group of well-known candidates. His unfavorable ratings -- now the highest for any candidate  is tracking -- have risen by 13 points since early April. His Positive Intensity Score has dropped to 6, among the lowest tested. All in all, Cain and Bachmann are recipients of the most intensely positive attitudes among Republicans who recognize them. No well-known candidate yet matches the Positive Intensity Scores of these two, or the level of enthusiasm Mike Huckabee engendered before he announced that he would not seek the GOP nomination. Results are based on telephone interviews conducted as part of  Daily tracking May 16-29, 2011, with random samples of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, aged 18 and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. Questions asking about the 10 potential candidates measured in this research were rotated among randomly selected samples of Republicans each night; over the 14-day period, each candidate was rated by a minimum of 1,500 Republicans and Republican-leaning independents. For the overall ratings of each potential candidate among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, including recognition scores, one can say with 95% confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points. For the Positive Intensity Score for each candidate, the maximum margin of sampling error varies depending on the size of the group recognizing the candidate. Interviews are conducted with respondents on landline telephones and cellular phones, with interviews conducted in Spanish for respondents who are primarily Spanish-speaking. Each sample includes a minimum quota of 400 cell phone respondents and 600 landline respondents per 1,000 national adults, with additional minimum quotas among landline respondents for gender within region. Landline telephone numbers are chosen at random among listed telephone numbers. Cell phone numbers are selected using random-digit-dial methods. Landline respondents are chosen at random within each household on the basis of which member had the most recent birthday. Samples are weighted by gender, age, race, Hispanic ethnicity, education, region, adults in the household, and phone status (cell phone only/landline only/both, cell phone mostly, and having an unlisted landline number). Demographic weighting targets are based on the March 2010 Current Population Survey figures for the aged 18 and older non-institutionalized population living in U.S. telephone households. All reported margins of sampling error include the computed design effects for weighting and sample design. In addition to sampling error, question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls.

Mitt Romney, one of the two leaders for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, receives generally equal support across Republican political issue groups. Sarah Palin, the other leader, has replaced Mike Huckabee as the leader among Republicans focused on social and moral issues. Mitt Romney (17%) and Sarah Palin (15%) lead in Republicans' preferences for the party's 2012 presidential nominee in 's first update after Mike Huckabee, Donald Trump, and Mitch Daniels announced they were not running. Herman Cain makes a solid debut at 8%. New presidential candidate Herman Cain, although not widely known, has the highest Positive Intensity Score among Republicans who recognize him of any potential GOP candidate  tracks. New candidates Tim Pawlenty, Ron Paul, and Newt Gingrich have average or below-average appeal.  findings over the past decade reveal that the years from 2010 to 2019 encompassed some revolutionary changes in public opinion.

"Political Byline This blog is no longer active as of October 31, 2011 Posted onJune 3, 2011June 3, 2011AuthorPatrick Not a big surprise at all. Although you would think it was, the way my iPod has been blowing up for the last hour! A federal grand jury in Raleigh, N.C., today handed down a six-count indictment against former Sen. John Edwards for allegedly using more than $900,000 in campaign funds to hide his mistress during the 2008 presidential campaign. The charges, following a two-year investigation, include conspiracy, illegal campaign contributions and making false statements. Edwards is expected to be arraigned on the charges this afternoon. Read the full indictment. “The Edwards probe is at its core a dispute over whether funds are contributions, independent expenditures or a gift. This kind of dispute almost never generates a criminal referral much less an indictment,” former federal prosecutor and four-term Alabama congressman Artur Davis told ABC News. An Edwards spokeswoman told the Associated Press that she wasn’t aware of the filing and declined immediate comment. via John Edwards Indicted on Charges of Conspiracy and False Statements – ABC News. Something tells me that ol’ “Silky Pony” is going to be doing the “Silky Pony” in a jail cell somewhere, with a big black man pretty soon. Although, I will say this; He will most likely serve his term in a “Country Club” type of Prison, like Martha Stewart served her time in. Whatever he is actually convicted on, will be appealed down to something light. You watch, rich people like Edwards never do jail time, ever. I do not have a thing against wealthy people at all; except when they use it to avoid justice. You watch and see if I am not right. I cannot say that he does not deserve what he is getting. What this creep did to his wife, was inexcusable. Personally, I’d like to see the fucking liberal asshole face a firing squad myself. But that, is just me.

"Patrick J.  - Official Website At the G-8 summit in Deauville, France, the news was dramatic, delivered by Nicolas Sarkozy of France and Barack Obama. To sustain the Arab Spring, America, Europe and Japan will provide $40 billion in fresh foreign aid for Arab nations that take the democratic path. The $40 billion breaks down thus: $10 billion from the G-8, $10 billion from the Gulf Arabs, and $20 billion from the World Bank and the international development banks. Now, as Gulf petrodollars come from U.S. consumers of gas and oil, and we are to be the largest contributor of direct aid, and we are the largest contributor to the World Bank and the development banks, U.S. taxpayers have just been put on the hook for untold billions. Yet that $40 billion over three years is pocket change compared to what Hillary Clinton promised at the Copenhagen summit. In December 2009, a year that millions of Americans lost their jobs and homes, Clinton pledged $20 billion annually as the U.S. share of a $100-billion-a-year transfer of wealth to help Third World nations cope with global warning. The U.S. contribution would start under Obama and rise to $20 billion annually by 2020, when the First World would begin transferring $1 trillion dollars every decade to the developing world. Ethiopia’s prime minister, Meles Zenawi, who announced the plan, indicated Africa’s disappointment at its meagerness. But, in return for a seat at the table managing the money, he graciously accepted. Am I missing something? Was not 2009 a tough year for America? Was it not the first of three in which we ran a deficit of 10 percent of our gross domestic product? Are we not talking of cutting Medicare and Social Security for seniors who have chipped in to those programs all their working lives to secure their retirement years? Cities are cutting education. States are slashing pensions. The Pentagon is killing weapons systems. And Barack Obama is ladling out fresh foreign aid. The Europeans, too — are they living in the real world? Greece hangs on a precipice, with Europeans debating whether Athens should be allowed to default, which would blow a hole through banks all across Europe. Portugal and Ireland could follow. In the worst case, Spain and Italy fail, entailing a terminal crisis of the EU. In Athens, anarchists have taken to the streets. Huge protests have erupted in Spain and Britain. How long can the austerity continue among the big debtor nations before social cohesion collapses? Across the continent, populist parties of the right are rising that seek to retrieve the sovereignty surrendered to transnational institutions by their globalist elites. Yet Sarkozy and Obama are talking about new foreign aid. The Wall Street Journal banner June 1 read: “Housing Imperils Recovery: Home Prices Sink to 2002 Levels; Consumer Confidence Falls as Pessimism Grows.” The lead ran thus: “House prices have sunk to 2002 prices, effectively wiping out almost a decade’s worth of home equity across the U.S. and imperiling the fragile economic recovery as Americans confront the falling value of their biggest investment.” That day, the Dow fell 280 points. And the June 2 Journal banner read: “Economic Outlook Darkens: Markets Stumble as Factories, Hiring Slow Down; Biggest Drop in Stocks in a Year.” Nearly one-fourth of American homeowners live in houses that are underwater, worth less than the mortgages on them. The index of consumer confidence fell last month from 66 percent to 60.8 percent. Only 38,000 private-sector jobs were created in May. The manufacturing boomlet seems to have stalled. Some 422,000 American workers filed for unemployment benefits in May. Talk of the “double-dip recession” is now pandemic. Yet a U.S. government $14.3 trillion in debt, running a third straight deficit of $1.4 trillion, is talking of sending billions in aid to Arab regimes where the deposed despots looted the place. Nor is America any longer exempt from the anarchic violence plaguing Europe. Over Memorial Day, when millions happily took off for the beach for that first taste of summer, they found trouble. The Drudge Report headlines the day after Memorial Day tell the story: “Miami ‘War Zone’ During Urban Weekend,” “Poet … Gunned Down in Front of Miami Poetry Club,” “Violent Crime Explodes in Myrtle During Black Bike Week; 8-hour Hell,” “Rib Fest at Rochester Beach Turns Rowdy,” “Riot on Long Island,” “Urban Melee in Charlotte,” “Unruly Crowd Shuts Down Nashville Water Park,” “Dozens of Gang Bangers” at Chicago beach. This is not the peaceful, prosperous America of 1947, with half the world’s production, that could cobble together Marshall Plans and ship wealth abroad to rebuild nations devastated by World War II. Today, America is herself in need of repair and rebuilding. Yet her leaders are living in yesterday. New - Now Available! A Conservative Classic! View Our Playlist… Note: We are an Amazon Associate.

"Among the many political splinters that grow when a society has lost direction, a movement toward post-liberal politics accelerates. History being a series of leaps from one extreme to another, zeroing in on a mean, we the people of the first world nations are now seeing doubt introduced in our view of the dominant theme of our society for at least the past thousand years. The political split between liberalism and ""everything else,"" from which conservatism descends, begins when civilizations grow and labor is subdivided beyond the individual. In smaller societies, people define roles; in large societies, roles are made and then people sought to fill them. This creates a centralized authority that reads needs from its people, formulates a singular rule, and then applies it back to the citizens. In addition to raw power, civilizations at this level invent ""narratives,"" or explanations of process in story form. These are like what we tell our children: the farmer grows the food, the people buy the food, and then the farmer buys more equipment to make more food. Narratives are both necessary and destructive, in that creating a meta-level in which we both discuss what we ought to do and explain what we are doing allows us to alter our narrative independently of the process it describes. We could call this the root of modern neurosis, which could be conveniently defined as ""insecurity"": unsure of what's actually going on, unsure of our role or importance in it, and distrust of people we don't know who are far away filling roles necessary for our survival. The split between reality and explanation of reality grows as people do what is convenient for them personally at the expense of the whole, as necessarily happens with any intelligent species. Nature, after all, appears to us as a dumb process. A mouse will have ten babies, eat the two that are deformed or smell funny, and raise eight of whom four may survive to breeding age. This sieve, by which testing each baby against the reality in which it lives picks those who survive, represents a parallel to our scientific method, our thinking, and our history: consider every possibility, test, and keep those possibilities that have proven to work. This process represents a direct opposite to our linear mode of thought. In linear thought, we work from what exists, assume it is necessary and apply it uniformly and universally. One idea; many identical applications. Nature tries many facets of an idea, eschews anything identical or equal, and sees what sticks. This however does not present a comforting thought to humans, who each like to think of themselves as immortal or at least safe, and want certainty of method, not ambiguity of outcome. As people do what is convenient for them at the expense of the whole, and others are fearing that they might be the babies eaten by a critical mouse mother, a movement of fear gathers in the civilization. Civilizations are united by a positive idea; mobs are united by what they fear. The movement of fear reverses logic from the natural to the linear, and instead of testing individuals against life, starts looking for a form of ""life"" -- a surrogate narrative -- to replace the ambiguity. The positive essence of liberalism is a basis in science, which desires to test all possibilities including those we take for granted as necessary, and so to remove the hide-bound and dusty relics which no longer apply. Liberal movements arise when, in response to people doing what is convenient at the expense of the whole, the wiser citizens start strengthening the institutions and hierarchies that force sensible rules on people. At this point, liberalism is in response swallowed up by the wave of fear that wants to avoid ambiguity. What was once a sensible movement to ensure society did not let its authority exceed reality now becomes a mania to deny reality. Inevitably, it strikes unconsciously at what it fears, which is natural selection, and instead imposes a narrative of equality, in which each citizen is presumed to be just as valuable as any other, which removes the thought that our human mouse mother might eat some and keep others. The power of liberalism comes from a simple idea: instead of treating institutions as all-important, treat people well regardless of what the convention is. As this movement gets coopted by the fear of the mob, it becomes a case of when you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail. The narrative of beating back institutions that oppress The People becomes a manic jihad to systematically destroy anything that is not 100% egalitarian and 100% new and in favor of individual equality. This step puts liberalism on par with the reactionary pseudo-conservatism that triggers it when citizens strengthen institutions in response to people doing what is convenient, not what is right. No longer united by a positive goal, it has become itself reactionary and started a chain reaction which will not rest until it has destroyed every social institution, created social anarchy, and removed culture, values, heritage and even human kindness, because it as a dogma will replace human interactions with a cynical wariness of how actions look in the eyes of the dogma, and not how they affect humans themselves. With liberalism as a motivation, the case of Robespierre became the archetype which all others would follow. Possessed of revolutionary zeal, he quickly purged those who opposed him -- and then found the circle of enemies widening as his well-intentioned ideas did not take fruit in reality. Hierarchy proves useful, and replacing the calcified privileged elites with amateurs guarantees both incompetence and corruption, which then makes enemies of former friends. This is why in liberal revolutions from Robespierre to Trotsky to Mao to Castro, the guillotine has never quite cooled. What is important about this history is that while liberalism becomes corrupted, it is not because its fundamental idea -- treat people well, and throw out institutions and authorities that are no longer relevant -- is corrupt. Rather, it is that because liberalism starts with the negative notion of defending people, it makes itself immediately susceptible to corruption. Saying that we must protect people from oppression gives everyone a quick path around reality by affirming the dogma, claiming that they feel oppressed, and therefore, that they should be given things at the expense of others, or ""liberated"" from authority itself. In other words, while liberalism has the right goal in mind, it method is broken. Its narrative easily gets perverted because it starts with the assumption of the individual as essential, in contrast to the scientific method and nature, in which what is essential is the test of the whole of reality itself. Unlike liberalism, conservatism embraces these methods, but correspondingly, becomes corrupted when its members pervert that to mean ""defend authority, right or wrong, because we fear the mob."" When looking for practical methods by which to implement our liberal goals, history becomes the most vital tool we have. Much as with science, we can look to the results of previous experiments as a foundation onto which we can build the next generation of experiments. History suggests two exceptions to the liberal paradigm: The first realization states that civilizations give rise to neurosis, or being ""unsure"" of things -- oneself, reality, what's the right path to take to be personally happy, and what's the right thing to do by society itself. This confused morality, because questions of how one ought to act are fundamentally moral, arises from the presence of other people and the sense that we should treat them as a form of absolute because they're here and, like us, they have personalities that fear death. This explains our tendency to form mobs. The second realization states that what exists now is less important than what will come, and that the past provides patterns for the future. Most people who want to manipulate you do so with a simple device: telling you how they can improve one aspect of your life, and conveniently not mentioning how it will impact other areas of your life, or even look in the future. No money down, buy it today, and if in three years it's broken and you're still paying debt service, well, not our problem. This means we cannot focus on defending either institutions or individuals, but can only fix the problem by designing a future that treats all individuals fairly. Thinking about our two exceptions above -- first, that people tend toward neurosis in civilizations; second, that we must consider more than the immediate, both future and past -- we can see that the only way to really guide ourselves is to look at civilization as a whole, as if we were considering a population of penguins, or a forest, or even a computer operating system. This fits more tightly with the conservative vision of the world, but because it is functional, speaks not to goal but to method. When we view society both systemically and systematically, we can see how the individuals are the means to the end of civilization, which in turn benefits its members. When we design a healthy civilization, it in turn benefits its members, but here's the catch: it does so by making itself healthy and not making individuals the lynchpin upon which its decisions pivot. If we make individuals our target, all of society skews to that end, and the health of the whole is forgotten. In this way, conservatism re-directs the obsession with the individual from ""protect all individuals by avoiding conflict through enforced individual equality"" to ""promote the good, and remove the bad who would harm the good,"" trusting nature and not human emotions to bring us the best possible outcome from our species. Interestingly, however, this method -- while it would not benefit everyone when first created -- over time, produces the most egalitarian, justice-minded, cooperative and yet individualistic society. By focusing on the whole, it is also able to say NO to some individuals in the name of protecting things the organic whole needs, including forests (Conservatives are never environmentalists; what they are is Conservationists, or people who set aside bigger chunks of nature where humans don't go so nature can maintain itself). Even further, conservatism preserves the scientific method/natural selection paradigm: our problem is not institutions, but people. Some do what is convenient at the expense of others, and use social guilt -- they're equal, why aren't you letting them go first in line? -- to enforce it through passive aggression; others think first of the health of the whole as a process, and then fit themselves into it, and those are the ones we want to keep. Unlike the mob-fear, conservatism of this nature accepts the laws of thermodynamics: if we cannot make decisions of one thing over another, as true equality would entail, all decisions are pointless because their outcomes are near-identical; as a result, there will be no motion, and no change, creating an entropy-bound civilization. Avoiding this requires we face the great paradox of life, which is that for us to exist there must be non-existence, for pleasure to exist there must be pain, and that for us to love our people, we must treat some un-lovingly. If we view the last thousand years as an error of history, and see how liberalism was a response to a calcified order that was itself a response to internal problems in a society decaying on every level, we can see how conservatism and liberalism originate in the same impulse: a desire to un-do the decay and return to a better time, when our social order is sane and we find it hard to locate oppressors except for specific individuals who went bad on us. With a post-liberal worldview, or one that is a combination of conservative methods and liberal intentions, we do not suffer the search for oppressors. Instead, we seek solutions to the health of the whole, and attack the social order directly, using our knowledge of history to see how civilizations have decayed in the past. In this reverent outlook toward the whole, we have escaped our modern narratives and found again a state of primal humankind. In this state, we do not rely on externalized forces like the institutions of state, religion and the market. Instead, we deal directly with the situation: we want a healthy society, so the best must rise and those who threaten that must be removed, and instead of dishing out equality propaganda, we each seek a place where we can perform to the best of our abilities. With a sacred goal in mind such as the health of a civilization as a whole, the stigma of status and monetary competition eases. Wherever this philosophy prevails, civilizations rise and reach high levels of excellence; whenever it is lost, civilizations begin their decay spiral into corruption, promotion of the stupid over the smart, destruction of knowledge, ecocide and other signs of an inability to control themselves. The choice remains in front of us: we do not need to be trapped by competing narratives, but can combine them and from that, find a greater, healthier future. December 12, 2009 "

Well, please, go read this article here. A sampling: The Abortion The doctor left the room and Steven came in. He told me that I needed to have an abortion because of the smoke damage to my lungs and the oxygen deprivation I had suffered. I said “No,” I wanted the baby. I was five-months pregnant. I could not believe he was even asking me to have an abortion at this stage. He spent over an hour pressing me to go ahead and have the abortion. He said that I was too young to have a baby and it would have brain damage because I had been in the fire and taken drugs. I became very quiet and repeated the answer “No” more than once. I said I should not be asked to make that decision while still in the hospital. He said I had to have the abortion now. He said I was too far along to wait because it would be illegal for me to get an abortion in another week. He sat beside my hospital bed, but we did not look at each other. I said no again. Finally he gave up and said, “OK, you can go home to your mother’s and have the baby there.” I was worn out and began to feel hopeless. My mother and stepfather would not be happy to have me return home pregnant. I believed they would also want me to have an abortion. I began to feel like life was caving in on me. I had no health insurance or money and did not believe Steven intended to help provide for our baby or me. He had not been providing medical care for me up to that time. I believed he was abandoning me as my father and my mother had. I began to cry and agreed to have the abortion. Steven was relieved and happy. He reassured me that he cared for me and that after the abortion everything would be fine. I was moved to another part of the hospital and a different doctor performed the abortion. It was a horrible nightmare I will never forget. I was traumatized by the experience. My baby had one defender in life; me, and I caved in to pressure because of fear of rejection and the unknown future. I wish I could go back and be given that chance again, to say no to the abortion one last time. I wish with all my heart I could have watched that baby live his life and grow to be a man. The doctor did not explain what the procedure would be like. Steven watched when the doctor punctured my uterus with a large needle. Then I was taken to a room to wait for the contractions. Steven sat beside me in the hospital until it was over. When the nurse would leave the room he was snorting cocaine on the table beside my bed. He even offered some to me once, but I just turned away, sick inside. Steven, high on cocaine, was emotionally detached, witnessing the procedure but cut off from the normal reaction and feelings of horror you would expect. At the time I was shocked and hurt by his behavior. But I know now that on an unconscious level, he must have been traumatized witnessing the death of his first-born son in such a horrific and direct way. Steven watched the baby come out and he told me later, when we were in New Hampshire, that it had been born alive and allowed to die. (I was not allowed to see the baby when it was delivered.) Steven told me later that it had been a boy and that he now felt terrible guilt and a sense of dread over what he had done. I did not know that such a thing could be legal. I could not imagine a world where a tiny baby could be born alive and tossed aside as worthless without ever seeing his mother’s face. Nothing was ever the same between us after that day, though I did not return home for over a year. I became very quiet and withdrawn after the abortion. I was grieving the loss of my baby and I could never look at Steven again without remembering what he had done to our son and me. I had just lived through a horrific fire that nearly claimed my life, but the abortion made me feel like part of me died with my baby. I felt cheated and betrayed, and angry with myself for agreeing to something that I knew was wrong. I felt deep anger and almost hatred for the doctor who performed the abortion. Everyone around me seemed to be moving on with life, but I was carrying a wound that would not go away. Steven was already involved with other women at that time. The fact that he was my guardian complicated things for him because he was legally responsible for me. I was young, had dropped out of high school, and did not understand my legal rights at the time. I felt completely powerless. I left Steven in February 1977 and returned to live with my mother and stepfather. Steven called a few times after I returned home and then I never heard from him again. Now, I very, very, highly recommend, in the strongest terms that I can convey in writing; that you go read the rest of that story. Anyone that does not see this, and think twice about having an Abortion; does not have a damned soul. Abortion is murder and it is a sick, twisted mindset that allows that barbaric practice to continue. I will, as a Christian, and as a Conservative blogger, continue to write against, advocate against and continue to use this blog to raise awareness of the barbaric practice of abortion. It is barbarism and it must be stopped. However, as a libertarian Conservative, I object to using the power of the Federal Government to stop the practice of abortion; however, I fully and wholeheartedly support a grassroots effort to stop the practice of abortion on the State level. This was a battle that pro-lifers, Conservatives and Christians alike fought in the 1980’s and ultimately lost; because they were, in this writers opinion fighting the battle in the wrong arena. It is my belief that Federalism should be applied across the board, in relationship to all matters and subjects. Not just on the subjects we choose to apply them. The battle for the Soul of America, including the battle for the protection of unborn life is a noble one, it is a Christian one, it is a righteous one; and it must be fought by those with Godly wisdom and knowledge of laws and practice. We must as wise as serpents and as harmless as doves. Fighting this fight foolishly and with wrong ideas, leads to waste. In this late hour, waste is not an option. (A special thank you of the highest order goes to a one Robert Stacy McCain for bringing light to this Story. Even thought Mr. McCain, “sold me up the river” a while back. I will be the Christian and give him credit where it is due.)

You’re right about the decision to have an abortion being something one should think long and hard about. What I don’t understand is why a woman, having done just that and reached the considered position that she didn’t want to have a child, should be compelled to do so just because of what you believe. I know that you won’t (more accurately, can’t) debate the issue, but perhaps you can explain what is so special about you that you should have the right to force people to behave as you wish? Forced-birthers like you often say that women should simply have the child and then give it up for adoption if she still wishes not to raise it. Even if that weren’t a stealthy and dishonest ruse (since it is assumed that she will not), no more than 2 percent of Americans have ever actually adopted . So what you’re really arguing for is the abandonment of children to the care of either the women who never wanted them in the first place, or the State… which is pretty heartless of you. OK, maybe not heartless: that would only be true if you had actually thought about the consequences of your position; but if you haven’t, then surely that disqualifies you from making such strong pronouncements? Perhaps you’ll muster the guts to respond this time… but most likely not: I seriously doubt you have the courage of your convictions. There is no debate, it is murder, period, end of discussion. Also… I know that you won’t (more accurately, can’t) debate the issue, but perhaps you can explain what is so special about you that you should have the right to force people to behave as you wish? Kiss my damned ass, you baby killing pig. The Bible says “Thou Shalt not kill” and that is good enough for me. End of discussion…. I’m right, you’re wrong, end of duscussion. Don’t like it? Don’t come here. Period. Comments are closed."

"An extraordinarily useful and mind boggling chart for those worried about inequality. A little background. Branko Milanovic, from whom the data comes, is a researcher into inequality. He tells us that there are three ways of measuring this globally. We could use the average income of each country and then compare these averages, this is Concept 1. Not all that useful as we're thus comparing the 400,000 people of Luxembourg as one unit with the 1.3 billion of India as one unit. Concept 2 takes these averages and then weights them by population. Thus we transform the 50 ish units representing the 900 million of Africa into something we can compare to the 1.3 billion of India. Concept 3 is much more difficult to calculate but is much more informative: treating the world as one unit and comparing incomes across the world. Which is what leads to the remarkable, astounding even, result above. Using ventiles (ie, 5% chunks of the population) and plotting what the actual living standards of each group is, in real terms, compared with the real terms living standards of others around the world. Yes, it's adjusted for purchasing power (PPP) and so on. And what's remarkable, astounding, about the result is that.... Yes, it really is saying that the bottom 5% in the USA have a higher income, a higher standard of living, than the top 5% of Indians. Capitalism red in tooth and claw, an entire nation quite uncaring about those left behind, produces a higher standard of living for the losers of the rat race than 50 years of socialism (and 20 years of playing catch up) does for the winners. Clearly, those who concern themselves with the incomes of the poor should be arguing for more reddish toothiness in our capitalism then. Media enquiries: 07584 778207 (Call only, 24 hour)"

By THR staff PBS is breaking from its long-term model and adding commercials to shows, PBS officials told member stations at a recent conference in Orlando. Instead of airing breaks every 50 minutes, as the public broadcaster does now, it will air them every 15 minutes beginning this fall, according to the New York Times. Nature and Nova are two of the shows that will contain corporate and foundation sponsor ads, promotional messages and branding every 15 minutes. Feelings about the move are mixed. “One of the biggest things they have to sell is that they are noncommercial,” David D. Oxenford, a partner with the law firm Davis Wright Tremaine, which represents several public broadcasters, told the Times. Said Alberto Ibargüen, a former PBS board chairman and president and chief executive of the Knight Foundation, “My first reaction is that in any kind of marketing opportunity, if you give up something that is desirable and differentiates you from your competition, it’s too bad, and that’s what this is.” But he said the public broadcaster did not make this move in haste. “The people of PBS would not do this lightly.” John F. Wilson, the chief programming executive for PBS, pointed to the steep drop off of audience members once the promotional spots aired at the end of the shows: “It’s almost as if someone pulled the fire alarm and they scrambled for the exits.” (PBS did not provide specific ratings figures.) “I’d look really carefully at a Masterpiece drama, at how we’d do that or how often we’d do that,” he added. Now producers will have to restructure their shows to contain breaks. “It’s not like this is untested, uncharted territory in some respect,” said Wilson. Antiques Roadshow will begin airing sponsor messages in January “between looking at Grandma’s sofa and the 1850s flintlock someone had in their basement,” Oxenford told the Times.

Subscribe Rehabilitating Lochner: Defending Individual Rights Against Progressive Reform By David E. Bernstein University of Chicago, 208 pagesWith the possible exception of Plessy v. Ferguson, which gave us the racial doctrine of “separate but equal,” the case of Lochner v. New York stands as the most reviled decision of the post–Civil War Supreme Court. As every law student knows, Lochner was a case in which a court packed with business sympathizers stuck it to the little guy in a shameless display of judicial activism.But, like a surprisingly large number of the things everyone knows, this conventional wisdom is almost entirely wrong, and David E. Bernstein’s new book, Rehabilitating Lochner, makes clear just how wrong it is—and how and why the Lochner narrative became established in the legal academy. In fact, writes Bernstein, “The Lochner line of cases pioneered the protection of the right of women to compete with men for employment free from sex-based regulations, the right of African Americans to exercise liberty and property rights free from Jim Crow legislation, and civil liberties against the states ranging from freedom of expression to the right to choose a private school education for one’s children.”Rather than being lumped together with the Plessy case, Bernstein argues, the Lochner ruling should be regarded as the anti-Plessy—a decision that refused to defer to stereotypes and self-dealing among the ruling class. Bernstein, a professor at George Mason Law School and a member of the blogging team at the Volokh Conspiracy, has produced a carefully researched, clearly reasoned, and ultimately powerful case that Lochner has been unjustly demonized.Lochner v. New York, which was brought to the Supreme Court in 1905, involved a statute that set maximum working hours for bakers. The law was, as Bernstein notes, not so much intended to protect bakers’ health (the justification given), but rather to drive small bakeshops, often family businesses that employed recent immigrants, out of business. (The Bakers’ Union newspaper condemned these immigrant workers as “the cheap labor of the green hand from foreign shores.”)As is often the case with regulation, large bakeries didn’t mind the law governing maximum hours because they could hire multiple shifts. Small bakeries, with their smaller workforces, found compliance far more difficult. The statute also set limits on ceiling heights designed to put cellar bakeries out of business.Small bakers felt that the law was enforced much more vigorously where nonunion bakeries were concerned, and Lochner, an immigrant who had opened his own bakery in Utica in 1894 where he worked alongside his wife and employees, soon attracted official attention. Lochner was charged with violation of the law because he let an employee named Aaron Schmitter and his family live above the bakery. What this sort of thing had to do with employee welfare wasn’t clear then and isn’t clear now a century later, but a ban on this sort of arrangement clearly disadvantaged small and family businesses in favor of big bakeries.In what was probably an arrangement to test the law, Schmitter wound up swearing an affidavit that he had stayed longer than the permitted number of hours so as to learn how to bake cakes. Lochner was charged with a criminal violation, and with support from the Utica Master Bakers Association, he took the case all the way to the Supreme Court. As Bernstein notes: “Much to almost everyone’s surprise, Lochner won, 5-4.”New York’s law, the Court held, wasn’t about health at all. Numerous exceptions and loopholes in the statute undercut that rationale, as did the absence of any evidence that baking was a particularly hazardous profession or that limiting the hours bakers worked had anything to do with the wholesomeness of bread. The majority weighed the state’s claims against scientific evidence, found them wanting, and concluded that the statute lacked sufficient justification when weighed against the freedom of contract protected by the Fourteenth Amendment’s due process clause. It was, said Justice Peckham, “a mere meddlesome interference with the rights of the individual.”Despite the holding, Bernstein writes, “ultimately, the practical effect of Lochner on bakers’ hours was very small.” By the time the decision was handed down, “productivity and working conditions had improved throughout the United States as the nation grew wealthier. Shorter working hours were becoming the norm nationwide, including in the baking industry.” Even without pressure from regulation and union complaints, basement bakeries were finding it hard to compete economically with larger concerns, and immigrants found better work elsewhere. The law’s sanitary provisions, meanwhile, were unaffected by the Lochner decision.Nor was Lochner controversial at the time it was decided. “Of the eight law review articles to comment on Lochner shortly after it was released, seven supported it, some vigorously,” Bernstein explains. “Also contrary to historical myth, newspaper editorial commentary on Lochner was generally supportive.”That general opinion would change later, when progressives and elite lawyers enamored of government power found the notion of “liberty of contract”—the central finding in Lochner—an unwelcome obstacle to their practical goals. To the progressives, “abstract legal freedom” needed to give way to considerations of “social policy,” and limitations on government power in the name of constitutional freedoms were old-fashioned.Bernstein spends a substantial part of his book describing the way in which an opinion that stopped a joint effort by large corporate interests and big unions to squash small businesses was somehow turned into the centerpiece of a narrative about the Supreme Court upholding big business at the expense of the little guy. Though the Lochner holding was consistent with the views of many scholars of the day, and with much preexisting case law, it was soon treated as some sort of judicial invention, the product of a Supreme Court without legal standards, but with a pro-corporate agenda. That the narrative was a false one did not, for decades, undermine its force.In my experience, law students exposed to Lochner for the first time, without being told that they’re supposed to hate it, tend to find it pretty reasonable: state passes law that impinges on individual freedom, court finds alleged purpose unpersuasive, strikes law to uphold freedom. That was pretty much the story of federal courts and the Constitution in the 20th century, and if Lochner had been at all unusual, that was only because it came so early on in the process. In methodology and approach, Lochner fits comfortably with all sorts of more celebrated cases, from Dean Milk v. Madison in 1951 (involving protectionism) to Griswold v. Connecticut in 1965 (the privacy ruling later used against Robert Bork in his ugly confirmation hearing).Elsewhere, as Bernstein recounts, advocates for African-Americans’ and women’s rights often made use of freedom of contract as a way to strike down laws limiting those groups’ economic freedom. Freedom of contract was a powerful weapon for dissolving the legal rules that, unsurprisingly, tended to work against those excluded from legislative power. Economic freedom, far from being a tool of the big bosses, was an important way for the underdogs to gain the freedom to compete, and to undermine the legal support that was essential to making Jim Crow and related laws work.This becomes particularly clear when Bernstein contrasts Lochner with Plessy v. Ferguson, decided nine years earlier. In Plessy, the Supreme Court, with regard to Louisiana’s segregation law, did precisely what Lochner’s critics said it should have done with the New York baking law: it deferred to the legislature’s judgment that legal segregation was acceptable despite constitutional arguments to the contrary. (Homer Plessy’s lawyers, in fact, thought they had a strong argument that state laws mandating segregation interfered with freedom of contract between railroads and their customers. If the Court had followed Lochner’s approach, they might have won, resulting in a devastating setback to the Jim Crow legal regime.)As Bernstein notes, “The long-standing myth of a wildly activist, reactionary Supreme Court imposing a grossly unpopular laissez-faire ideology on the American people on behalf of large corporate interests—with little concern for precedent, constitutional text, or individual or minority rights—is far removed from historical reality. The academics who invented the prevalent mythology likely sought, consciously or not, to justify their preferred political outcomes.”George Orwell wrote that to control the past was to control the present, and the future. The false narrative of Lochner has controlled the past for decades, but Bernstein’s clear and incisive work may wrest that control away and move us back to the truth. And if readers recognize that much of what they have been told about Lochner is wrong, perhaps they will employ an informed skepticism toward many other things in constitutional law that “everyone knows.” Such skepticism, it seems, is entirely warranted. With the possible exception of Plessy v. Ferguson, which gave us the racial doctrine of “separate but equal,” the case of Lochner v. New York stands as the most reviled decision of the post–Civil War Supreme Court. As every law student knows, Lochner was a case in which a court packed with business sympathizers stuck it to the little guy in a shameless display of judicial activism.

(Homer Plessy’s lawyers, in fact, thought they had a strong argument that state laws mandating segregation interfered with freedom of contract between railroads and their customers. If the Court had followed Lochner’s approach, they might have won, resulting in a devastating setback to the Jim Crow legal regime.) As Bernstein notes, “The long-standing myth of a wildly activist, reactionary Supreme Court imposing a grossly unpopular laissez-faire ideology on the American people on behalf of large corporate interests—with little concern for precedent, constitutional text, or individual or minority rights—is far removed from historical reality. The academics who invented the prevalent mythology likely sought, consciously or not, to justify their preferred political outcomes.” George Orwell wrote that to control the past was to control the present, and the future. The false narrative of Lochner has controlled the past for decades, but Bernstein’s clear and incisive work may wrest that control away and move us back to the truth. And if readers recognize that much of what they have been told about Lochner is wrong, perhaps they will employ an informed skepticism toward many other things in constitutional law that “everyone knows.” Such skepticism, it seems, is entirely warranted.

"Advertisement Supported by By James Dao GREENVILLE, N.C. — On matters like abortion, military spending and religion, Representative Walter B. Jones seems thoroughly in tune with this conservative, staunchly Republican district in eastern North Carolina, home to the Marine Corps’ Camp Lejeune and thousands of military retirees. On the issue of war, however, Mr. Jones has defied typecasting. An early critic of the American invasion of Iraq, he has been ostracized by the Republican leadership in Congress. And now he is emerging as a leading advocate for swiftly withdrawing American forces from Afghanistan, a position that has made him, of all things, a liberal hero. “When you talk about war, political parties don’t matter,” he said in an interview. But Mr. Jones may no longer be the outlier he was six years ago. Late last month, an amendment intended to accelerate the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan sponsored by Mr. Jones and Representative Jim McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts, nearly passed — in part because 26 Republicans broke with their leadership to support it, triple the number who voted for a similar measure last year. Their ranks included at least three freshmen elected with Tea Party support. Some foreign policy analysts now see Mr. Jones, 68; Representative Ron Paul, Republican of Texas; and a small coterie of Tea Party stalwarts as the leading edge of a conservative movement to rein in American military power — a break from the muscular foreign policy of President George W. Bush. “They reflect a growing discontent within the Republican Party about the wars and a growing feeling that they don’t want to spend money on them anymore,” said John Isaacs, executive director of the Council for a Livable World, an advocacy group that promotes arms control. “They are military noninterventionists.” Mr. Jones agreed, saying: “We can’t police the world anymore. We’re not the world power. It’s China. Our economy is in chaos.” Conversations with voters in Mr. Jones’s district, which embraces much of North Carolina’s Atlantic coastline, suggest that many who were baffled or infuriated by his opposition to the Iraq war in 2005 are liking his views on Afghanistan in 2011. At a Memorial Day event in Beaufort on May 28, August Braddy, 68, declared that Mr. Jones — who over eight terms has voted with the American Conservative Union more than 80 percent of the time — was too liberal. But on Afghanistan, Mr. Braddy, who was wearing a red Tea Party shirt, said he thought Mr. Jones was right. “We’re broke; we can’t afford it,” he said. “We did what we went there to do: get Bin Laden.” Polls suggest that Republican voters are moving in Mr. Jones’s direction. In a New York Times/CBS News poll last month, 43 percent of Republicans said the United States should reduce troop strength in Afghanistan, double the number who said that in November 2009. Some prominent Republicans, including Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi and Grover Norquist, the antitax champion, have also begun questioning the American mission in Afghanistan. Still, the vast majority of Republicans in Congress remain supportive of the war. On Mr. Jones’s amendment, 207 Republicans voted no, while 178 Democrats voted in favor. But the amendment failed by just 11 votes, and Mr. Jones believes that by fall, it will pass. For many of the Republicans who are questioning the war, cost is clearly the driving factor. Mr. Jones makes that case in his district, telling voters that spending $8 billion a month to prop up what he calls a corrupt government is a waste of money. “If we’re going to cut programs for children who need milk in the morning, if we’re going to cut programs for seniors who need a sandwich at lunch, if we’re going to cut veterans benefits, then, for God’s sake, let’s bring back our troops from Afghanistan,” he said in Beaufort, to loud applause. But Mr. Jones’s wrenching odyssey from disciple of Speaker Newt Gingrich to war opponent was far more about personal guilt than budget deficits. The son of a Democratic congressman, Mr. Jones was elected in the Republican tide of 1994 with the support of a conservative icon, Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina. He came to be a steadfast supporter of Mr. Gingrich’s small-government agenda. In 2002, Mr. Jones voted for the resolution authorizing the invasion of Iraq. He also persuaded House cafeterias to rename their French fries “freedom fries,” tweaking the French government for opposing the invasion. But Mr. Jones now says he had misgivings about the vote almost immediately. After he attended his first funeral at Camp Lejeune for a Marine killed just weeks into the invasion, those misgivings grew into pangs of doubt. He started writing letters to the relatives of every American killed in Iraq or Afghanistan. (He has signed more than 10,370 at last count.) And he began consulting with critics of the invasion, including Gen. Anthony C. Zinni, a retired Marine. Who are the Taliban? The Taliban arose in 1994 amid the turmoil that came after the withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan in 1989. They used brutal public punishments, including floggings, amputations and mass executions, to enforce their rules. Here’s more on their origin story and their record as rulers. Who are the Taliban leaders? These are the top leaders of the Taliban, men who have spent years on the run, in hiding, in jail and dodging American drones. Little is known about them or how they plan to govern, including whether they will be as tolerant as they claim to be. One spokesman told The Times that the group wanted to forget its past, but that there would be some restrictions. How did the Taliban gain control? See how the Taliban retook power in Afghanistan in a few months, and read about how their strategy enabled them to do so. What happens to the women of Afghanistan? The last time the Taliban were in power, they barred women and girls from taking most jobs or going to school. Afghan women have made many gains since the Taliban were toppled, but now they fear that ground may be lost. Taliban officials are trying to reassure women that things will be different, but there are signs that, at least in some areas, they have begun to reimpose the old order. What does their victory mean for terrorist groups? The United States invaded Afghanistan 20 years ago in response to terrorism, and many worry that Al Qaeda and other radical groups will again find safe haven there. On Aug. 26, deadly explosions outside Afghanistan’s main airport claimed by the Islamic State demonstrated that terrorists remain a threat. How will this affect future U.S. policy in the region? Washington and the Taliban may spend years pulled between cooperation and conflict, Some of the key issues at hand include: how to cooperate against a mutual enemy, the Islamic State branch in the region, known as ISIS-K, and whether the U.S. should release $9.4 billion in Afghan government currency reserves that are frozen in the country. “I came to believe we were misled, we were lied to,” Mr. Jones said recently. “The people around Bush manipulated the intelligence.” In June 2005, he stunned his party establishment by appearing at a news conference with Mr. Paul and Representative Dennis Kucinich, a liberal Ohio Democrat, to call on Mr. Bush to start reducing troop levels in Iraq. Mr. Jones’s offices were immediately flooded with calls from angry constituents who branded him a traitor and demanded his resignation. He made the cover of Mother Jones magazine in 2006 and drew a tough primary challenge in 2008 from an opponent who called him “a poster boy for the left.” Mr. Jones won handily. A convert to Roman Catholicism, Mr. Jones says he has not missed a Sunday Mass in nearly 40 years. His faith, he says, caused him to question the war. “I did not vote my conscience and I sent kids to die, and they didn’t have to go,” he said. “I thank God that he made me feel guilty about my vote on Iraq.” Afghanistan is different from Iraq, he says, because he believes that the latter invasion was justified. But he has come to believe that the strategy of trying to strengthen the government of President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan and build that country’s security forces is doomed. In Beaufort, about 50 miles from Camp Lejeune, several former Marines at the Memorial Day event agreed. “We’re losing a lot of people there and not seeing anything in return,” said Gregory Barnett, who spent 22 years in the Marine Corps. “Now that we’ve gotten Bin Laden, we’ve been there long enough.” Advertisement"
"Advertisement Supported by By Jennifer Medina SANTA MONICA, Calif. — When a group of activists proposed banning circumcision in San Francisco last fall, many people simply brushed them aside. Even in that liberal seaside city, it seemed implausible that thousands of people would support an effort to outlaw an ancient ritual that Jews and Muslims believe fulfills a commandment issued by God. But last month, the group collected the more than 7,100 signatures needed to get a measure on the fall ballot that would make it illegal to snip the foreskin of a minor within city limits. Now a similar effort is under way in Santa Monica to get such a measure on the ballot for November 2012. If the anticircumcision activists (they prefer the term “intactivists”) have their way, cities across the country may be voting on whether to criminalize a practice that is common in many American hospitals. Activists say the measures would protect children from an unnecessary medical procedure, calling it “male genital mutilation.” “This is the furthest we’ve gotten, and it is a huge step for us,” said Matthew Hess, an activist based in San Diego who wrote both bills. Mr. Hess has created similar legislation for states across the country, but those measures never had much traction. Now he is fielding calls from people who want to organize similar movements in their cities. “This is a conversation we are long overdue to have in this country,” he said. “The end goal for us is making cutting boys’ foreskin a federal crime.” Jewish groups see the ballot measures as a very real threat, likening them to bans on circumcision that existed in Soviet-era Russia and Eastern Europe and in ancient Roman and Greek times. The circumcision of males is an inviolable requirement of Jewish law that dates back to Abraham’s circumcision of himself in the Book of Genesis. They say the proposed ban is an assault on religious freedom that could have a widespread impact all over the country. Beyond the biblical, there are emotional connections: checking for circumcision was one of the ways Jewish children could be culled from their peers by Nazis and the czar’s armies. “People are shocked that it has reached this level because there has never been this kind of a direct assault on a Jewish practice here,” said Marc Stern, associate general counsel for the American Jewish Committee, an advocacy group. “This is something that American Jews have always taken for granted — that something that was so contested elsewhere but here, we’re safe and we’re secure.” Mr. Hess also writes an online comic book, “Foreskin Man,” with villains like “Monster Mohel.” On Friday, the Anti-Defamation League issued a statement saying the comic employed “grotesque anti-Semitic imagery.” Jena Troutman, the mother of two young boys who is promoting the ballot measure in Santa Monica, said she did not think of herself as a crusader against religion. Instead, she views her work as a chance to educate would-be parents against a procedure that “can really do serious damage to the child.” “I am just a mom trying to save the little babies,” Ms. Troutman said. “I’d rather be on the beach, but nobody is talking about this, so I have to.” Ms. Troutman has run the Web site wholebabyrevolution.com for two years, and she is fond of rattling off sayings like “Your baby is perfect, no snipping required.” Well versed in the stories of circumcisions gone awry, she said the recent death of a New York City toddler who was circumcised at a hospital convinced her that she should push for the ballot measure. Ms. Troutman, who has worked as a lactation educator and a doula, said she often approached women on the beach to warn them about the dangers of circumcising, but she has declined to answer questions about her own children. Although precise numbers are not known, several studies have indicated that circumcision rates have been declining in the United States for the past several years and now range from 30 percent to 50 percent of all male infants. Many medical groups take a neutral approach, saying that the practice is not harmful and that there is not enough scientific evidence to conclude that it is necessary, and leave the decision to parents and their doctor. Several studies have linked circumcision with a reduction in the spread of H.I.V. Roughly half of the 694 baby boys born in the Santa Monica-U.C.L.A. Medical Center and Orthopaedic Hospital in 2010 were circumcised before they left the hospital, officials there said. Dr. David Baron, a family physician, certified mohel — someone who performs ritual circumcision — and former chief of staff at Santa Monica-U.C.L.A., said that he would not press any parent to circumcise a son but that he viewed the effort to ban the procedure as “ridiculous and dishonest.” “To say it is mutilation is wrong from the get-go,” Dr. Baron said. “It is a perfectly valid decision to say that it is not what you want for your child. Any doctor who says it is needed is not being honest, but to say that it needs to be banned is shocking.” If the ballot measure passed, it would certainly face legal challenges. But several legal experts said it was far from certain that it would be struck down in a court. Ms. Troutman said she considered putting religious exemptions in the measure, but then decided, “Why should only some babies be protected?” Rabbi Yehuda Lebovics, an Orthodox mohel based in Los Angeles who says he has performed some 20,000 circumcisions over several decades, said he often had to soothe nervous mothers. “I am now doing the sons of the boys I did 30 years ago,” Rabbi Lebovics said. “So I turn to the new mother and ask, ‘Do you have any complaints in the way it turned out?’ ” Advertisement"
"Link copied. We want to bridge divides to reach everyone. In Afghanistan, the US women's activist group finds that their Afghan counterparts want US troop presence – as well as more reconstruction. Loading... October 6, 2009 When Medea Benjamin stood up in a Kabul meeting hall this weekend to ask Masooda Jalal if she would prefer more international troops or more development funds, the cofounder of US antiwar group Code Pink was hoping her fellow activist would support her call for US troop withdrawal. She was disappointed. Ms. Jalhal, the former Afghan minister of women, bluntly told her both were needed. ""It is good for Afghanistan to have more troops – more troops committed with the aim of building peace and against war, terrorism, and security – along with other resources,"" she answered. ""Coming together they will help with better reconstruction."" Rethinking their position Code Pink, founded in 2002 to oppose the US invasion of Iraq, is one of the more high-profile women's antiwar groups being forced to rethink its position as Afghan women explain theirs: Without international troops, they say, armed groups could return with a vengeance – and that would leave women most vulnerable. Though Afghans have their grievances against the international troops' presence, chief among them civilian casualties, many fear an abrupt departure would create a dangerous security vacuum to be filled by predatory and rapacious militias. Many women, primary victims of such groups in the past, are adamant that international troops stay until a sufficient number of local forces are trained and the rule of law established. (Read more about Afghan women's concerns here.) During their weeklong visit here, in which they met with government officials, politicians, ministers, women activists, and civil society groups, the small team of Code Pink members had hoped to gather evidence to bolster their call for US troop withdrawal within two years, and capitalize on growing anxiety back home about the war. While the group hasn't dropped its call for a pullout, the visit convinced them that setting a deadline isn't in Afghanistan's interests, say Ms. Benjamin and fellow cofounder Jodie Evans. ""We would leave with the same parameters of an exit strategy but we might perhaps be more flexible about a timeline,"" says Benjamin. ""That's where we have opened ourselves, being here, to some other possibilities. We have been feeling a sense of fear of the people of the return of the Taliban. So many people are saying that, 'If the US troops left the country, would collapse. We'd go into civil war.' A palpable sense of fear that is making us start to reconsider that."" Code Pink says it will continue to oppose sending more troops to Afghanistan – a move facing heated debate in Washington – and advocate for more funding for aid and humanitarian projects instead. The group's visit coincided with a ""peace trialogue"" organized last week by the Delhi Policy Group that brought together women of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India. Some participants of the meeting, who have traditionally seen demilitarization as a key to peacebuilding, also faced strong opposition from local activists when they tried to include demilitarization in a statement published at the end of the gathering. ""In the current situation of terrorism, we cannot say troops should be withdrawn,"" Shinkai Karokhail, an Afghan member of Parliament and woman activist, told them. ""International troop presence here is a guarantee for my safety."" Follow us on Twitter. Already a subscriber?

"The Republican campaigns of 2006 and 2008 consisted of long litanies of dropping the ball when it comes to the Democrats' vulnerabilities. I refer specifically to John McCain's and Rick Santorum's inexcusable failure to call their opponents out for indefensible racist, anti-Semitic, and/or anti-Catholic connections. Casey's acceptance of MoveOn.org's support should have disqualified him, especially in a state with a large Catholic population. MoveOn.org Promoted Anti-Semitic and Anti-Catholic Hate Speech In 2006, I joined Jan Poller and Robert Goldberg in exposing MoveOn.org's exercise of editorial control in favor of anti-Semitic, anti-Catholic, and other forms of hate speech at the organization's prized but now disgraced Action Forum. A good summary of the arguments appears here. MoveOn.org's Eli Pariser argued that the group did not know about the hate speech, which is interesting because the Action Forum's FAQ page said the moderators read each entry twice to get ideas for MoveOn's agenda. He also said the organization removed the hate speech as soon as it was discovered, but I found and posted online literally dozens of such entries weeks later. MoveOn.org had therefore been caught red-handed in easily disproven lies that should have resulted in its outright destruction as a viable organization. Had Abraham Foxman (Anti-Defamation League) and the National Jewish Democratic Council not used their Jewish identities to whitewash MoveOn.org at all costs, the group would probably have ceased to exist in 2006. As matters stand, MoveOn.org had to disable its prized Action Forum permanently to control the spreading damage, and it has far less influence today than it did in 2006. MoveOn.org also published a photomanipulation of Pope Benedict waving a gavel in front of the U.S. Supreme Court, a picture that could have easily been modeled on the anti-Catholic cartoons of 19th century cartoonist Thomas Nast (also the creator of the Republican Elephant and Democratic Donkey). Bob Casey refused to repudiate MoveOn.org's endorsement even though he was presented with ample proof that MoveOn knew about, tolerated, and even welcomed the hate speech. Although I urged Santorum's team repeatedly to use this against Casey, it sat down in Unterkunft and, from where I sit, threw its man's Senate seat away. Jim Gerlach on the other hand followed our advice to use Lois Murphy's acceptance of this group's endorsement against her, and he did so successfully. Republicans must revisit MoveOn.org's sorry track record, to which it added a defamatory insult to General David Petraeus (""General Betray Us,"" a puerile phrase that could have come straight from Beavis and Butthead), during the 2012 elections noting that Barack Obama also accepted this group's support. To this I can add Obama's open association with and promotion of the country's most vicious racists and anti-Semites. Obama's Church Blood Libeled the United States and Israel Most people know that Barack Obama's pastor called on God to damn America. It is also a matter of record that Jeremiah Wright published a blood libel of the United States by accusing it of developing the AIDS virus, i.e. using biological warfare to murder countless people around the world. The Trinity United Church of Christ's official bulletin of June 10, 2007 added a blood libel of Israel and South Africa: ""Both worked on an ethnic bomb that kills Blacks and Arabs."" I downloaded the TUCC's bulletins before the church ""disappeared"" them. For example: I also downloaded screen shots of Jeremiah Wright's and Michael Pfleger's testimonials on Barack Obama's official campaign site before the campaign threw them under the bus. Pfleger exulted at TUCC with regard to Hillary Clinton's defeat in a primary, ""There were a whole lot of white people crying!"" The people with whom the Obamas went to church for 20 years, and to whose influence they exposed their children, gave this specific statement a standing ovation that can still be seen on YouTube. Aesop spoke correctly when he said birds of a feather flock together. Guilt by association, as used by Joe McCarthy, involved suspicion of people for merely being in the same room with a Communist. Barack Obama was not merely in the same room with vicious racists and anti-Semites, he has spoken at their organizations and posed arm in arm with them. Obama, Sharpton, and Freddy's Fashion Mart I learned about Al Sharpton when I lived in Wappingers Falls NY in 1988. Sharpton and his entourage falsely accused several local people of raping Tawana Brawley, and Sharpton was later found civilly liable for defamation of local attorney Steven Pagones. Sharpton's inflammatory, racist, and anti-Semitic rhetoric was to prove literally inflammatory several years later. In 1995, the National Action Network, while acting under Sharpton's leadership and supervision, paraded around a Jewish-owned store while shouting racial and anti-Semitic epithets such as ""Don't give the Jew a dime,"" ""greedy Jew bastards,"" ""make the cracker suffer,"" and ""white interloper."" The latter was from Sharpton himself, and it obviously set the example for his followers. A deranged individual then acted on this hate speech by setting Freddy's Fashion Mart on fire to kill seven employees. A Google search on Sharpton's name and the Crown Heights riots also is instructive. Barack Obama appeared at the National Action Network, and arm in arm with Mr. Sharpton, on no fewer than two occasions (2007 and 2011). In the latter case, he lent the prestige of the office of the President of the United States to a professional hate monger and a proven (by its actions at Freddy's Fashion Mart) hate organization. The National Jewish Democratic Council unwittingly supported this case against Obama when it condemned Mitt Romney for appearing at the museum of Henry Ford, a long-dead ex-anti-Semite (noting that Ford retracted and repudiated The International Jew). What, then, are we to say of Barack Obama's open association with and promotion of a live and unrepentant one like Sharpton? Our response to NJDC is that of King Henry V: ""You must not dare for shame to talk of mercy / For your own reasons turn into your bosoms / As dogs upon their masters, worrying you."" Republicans need to say plenty about Sharpton, Wright, Pfleger, MoveOn.org, and the racist content of Obama's Dreams from My Father for which I can supply exact page numbers in contrast to the urban legends that diluted the truth in 2008.

"Alternate headline: Great Depression worries go mainstream. I guess we can count Barack Obama among the 51% who aren’t worried about it, since he’s not even worrying about a double-dip recession. CNN’s latest poll shows an almost even split between Americans who expect a big collapse within a year, and, er, Americans who aren’t quite as worried about it: President Barack Obama’s overall approval rating has dropped below 50 percent as a growing number of Americans worry that the U.S. is likely to slip into another Great Depression within the next 12 months, according to a new national poll. The three-point difference makes this a dead heat within the margin of error. Moreover, this is the most pessimistic survey result we’ve seen on the subject. In 2008, only 38% expected another Great Depression, which rose to 41% in 2009 shortly after Obama took office. In the two years of the Obamanomics recovery, it’s jumped seven points — which shows just how effective people believe Obamanomics to be. His Osama bin Laden bounce has dissipated, CNN’s analysis concludes, especially among Republicans. Two weeks ago, 27% of Republicans approved of his performance, but that’s been cut almost in half to 14%. Independents have also started peeling away, with a five point drop in the same period from 47% to 42%. His overall approval rating dropped from 54/48 — apparently a math-challenged result in May from CNN that adds up to 102%, so I’m guessing that’s a typo for 54/46 — to 48/48 today. CNN doesn’t break down approval ratings on the issues for Obama in this release (nor its sample breakdown, for that matter), but they did poll on which issues matter most to those voting for President in 2012. The ratings for “extremely important” show 51% selecting that option for the economy, followed by a tie at 45% between unemployment and health care. If 51% of people think that the economy is extremely important for their vote and 48% think we’re going to enter a Great Depression before they have a chance to cast it, that’s not exactly going to bode well for Obama’s re-election chances. Maybe he needs to worry a little more about the economic backslide, or at least acknowledge it. "

""I fully support deleting the Fairness Doctrine and related provisions from the Code of Federal Regulations, so that there can be no mistake that what has been a dead letter is truly dead,"" Genachowski wrote in a letter Monday to House Energy and Commerce Chairman Fred Upton (R-Mich.). ""I look forward to effectuating this change when acting on the staff's recommendations and anticipate that the process can be completed in the near future."" Genachowski has frequently voiced his opposition to the rule, which required broadcasters to cover controversial public issues in a manner deemed fair and balanced by the FCC. The commission stopped enforcing the rule in 1987 after concluding it was unconstitutional, but in recent years some Democrats have suggested reviving the policy in response to the increasingly partisan nature of cable news. Upton and Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.) wrote to Genachowski last month asking him to strike the rule, citing the Obama administration's ongoing effort to clear up outdated regulations. Genachowski agreed with the lawmakers' request, but noted the doctrine is already dead without a fresh vote from the commission. ""In my view, the Fairness Doctrine holds the potential to chill free speech and the free flow of ideas and, accordingly, was properly abandoned,"" Genachowski said. The lawmakers praised the FCC chairman for complying with their request, and asked for details of the process in a letter sent Wednesday. “We are heartened by your continued opposition to the Fairness Doctrine because of its chilling effects on free speech and the free flow of ideas,” Upton and Walden wrote. “When precisely will you eliminate the Fairness Doctrine and related regulations? What is involved? Do you have the support of your fellow commissioners? How long will it take?” The pair also asked for details of the FCC's other efforts at deregulation, including estimates of how many jobs the efforts would produce. View the discussion thread.

"Sounding every bit like the whiteboard eggheads who keep spinning around the Ivy League-Washington revolving door, Obama announced breathlessly: ""If we could match up schools and businesses, we could create pipelines right from the classroom to the office or the factory floor. This would help workers find better jobs, and it would help companies find the highly educated and highly trained people that they need in order to prosper and to remain competitive."" In Obama World, private businesses are just too darned dumb to figure out how to connect the dots and create these pipelines for themselves. In the real world, private businesses spend up to 12 times more on job-training programs and trainee salaries than state and federal governments combined, according to workforce analysts. The American Society for Training and Development reports that U.S. private entities spent an estimated $125.9 billion on employee learning and development in 2009 alone. And you can bet in these financial hard times that private-sector employers are making sure every job-training penny is well spent. As for your tax dollars, rest assured they are being squandered the same way public-sector job trainers have been squandering such funding for the past eight decades. Earlier this year, a General Accounting Office report found that no one in the bowels of the Beltway really knows how effective the feds' $18 billion a year spent on 47 separate job-training programs run by nine different agencies really is. That's because half of those programs haven't undergone a performance review since 2004, and only five have ever conducted research on whether job seekers in the program do better than those who weren't enrolled. Among those five, the GAO wrote, the evaluators ""generally found the effects of participation were not consistent across programs, with only some demonstrating positive impacts that tended to be small, inconclusive or restricted to short-term impacts."" This much is clear. The Obama stimulus has funded vital workforce training expenses for a $100,000 nepotistic fraud ring in Charleston, W. V., that splurged on pet care, bar tabs and luxury hotel stays. A con-artist family employed by the state siphoned off job-training money that was supposed to subsidize technology education for 200 elderly West Virginians. In Tampa Bay, Fla., the local Workforce Alliance squandered tens of thousands of tax dollars on lunches at Hooters, cupcake delivery fees and VIP country music concert tickets. In Iowa, $730,000 in federal job-training cash from the stimulus law was redistributed to well-off graduate students to pay off their student loan debt -- over and above the more than $205 million in federal student financial aid those students received. In Washington, Job Corps administrators helped themselves to untold gobs of job-training cash by approving bogus invoices and creating ghost employees. And in Portage County, Ohio, investigators found that government employees had used an estimated $700,000 in federal job-training money to pay the college tuition of certain county officials and to purchase other items, such as an ""XBox 360, laptops, promotion bags, golf shirts, messenger bags, briefcases, Giant Eagle food cards, and golf tees -- among other things purchased as promotional items that are not allowable expenses under federal law."" Tale as old as time. Cato Institute analyst James Bovard's seminal work on the federal job-training juggernaut says it all: ""Many, if not most, of the participants in federal jobs and job-training programs would be better off today if the programs had never existed. Aside from wasting scores of billions of dollars, government manpower programs distorted people's lives and careers by making false promises, leading them to believe that a year or two in this or that program was the key to the future. People spent valuable time in positions that gave them nothing more than a paycheck or a certificate, while they could have been developing real skills in private jobs with a future. The fallacy underlying all job-training programs is that the private sector lacks the incentive to train people for jobs."" Remember: Government job-training programs don't create jobs. They create bigger government payrolls, redistribute unemployment and perpetuate the illusion of economic recovery and prosperity. It's a juggernaut too big to fail and too entrenched to kill. .com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis. "
"The global and domestic landscape is one of turmoil, indecision, and uncertainty. Everywhere one looks there is chaos and potential disaster, whether in the financial, economic, or political sphere. Since the beginning of the post-World War II era there has been one constant that has been the stabilizing force in the world: the stature, power, and influence of the United States. In a matter of a few short years the Obama presidency has deliberately and overwhelmingly eroded America's pre-eminence, which has resulted in global instability and domestic unease. Barack Obama assumed the office of the presidency as a man brought up and steeped in 1960's radicalism, which advanced the doctrine that America, as the lone Western superpower, represented the evil nature of colonialism and capitalism's exploitation of the masses -- whether there was any truth in this assertion or that the United States was guilty of these sins was irrelevant. The material and military success of America and the West could only have come about from expropriating the wealth and labor of the peoples of the world. This is a simplistic and emotional argument and one that refuses to take into account the basic nature of the human race and its failings and foibles. Mankind always has and always will have as its preeminent trait the need to survive, and to that end human beings are susceptible to committing crimes and exploiting their fellow man. Thus any society will always have many failings, but the key measure of any civilization is what it does to control those tendencies and strive for an equitable culture. No nation or culture in history has done more to advance the well-being of mankind than the United States and Western civilization. However to the Marxist mindset of the radical left, only they, utilizing the vehicle of a massive central government, could control mankind's nature and create a fair society. It is the ideal philosophy for those who, so enamored with themselves, can wallow in their self-importance and rule with a heavy hand the same masses they claim to protect. Under no circumstances, therefore, can these revolutionaries defend or profess admiration for their country; instead they must not only transform the United States into a villain, but destroy any vestiges of its accomplishments in order to permanently retain control over the populace and exact revenge for the alleged transgressions of the West. Barack Obama has spent his entire life, from birth to the present, marinated in this mindset. He is thus incapable of change or being receptive to any other viewpoint, as that would be an admission of failure. His chief concern is himself, the retention and expansion of government power as well as the plight of the third world, rather than the suffering of the average American citizen facing economic and societal ruin. He and his fellow-travelers can thus justify bankrupting the country as a necessary part of the remaking and absolution of the United States. He can show disdain and at times outright hostility toward age-old European allies who were, in his mind, the original sinners in the exploitation of the downtrodden. He has no compunction in forcing Israel, as an outpost of Western civilization, to compromise and bend to all the demands of the Palestinians. To Barack Obama there is no overriding American interest in virtually all foreign matters except to take a back seat and surrender its influence to other mainly non-Western powers. He continues to pursue many of George Bush's policies against terrorism and the war in Afghanistan, while taking steps designed to assure America does not win the conflict in the long-term. His short-term goal is to be certain a terrorist attack within the United States does not occur in the next two years as that would doom his re-election chances and put in jeopardy his agenda. Meanwhile he willingly discards old allies in the Middle East while turning a blind eye and tacitly promoting the radicalization of many countries in the region. He relies on his ego-driven messianic demeanor and skin color to intimidate both domestic political adversaries and international allies, while believing the same traits will cause those in the non-Western world to view him as their savior. It is now inarguable that the 1980's were the high-water mark of competent and viable American international leadership in the post-World War II era. Today, during the Obama years, the international scene is led by arguably the least competent and most easily intimidated, as the majority of world leaders consist of those whose principal interests are themselves and the trappings of office. They are unwilling or unable to challenge the ruinous economic and foreign policies of President Obama and they fail to understand that the United States, under his leadership, will no longer be the leader of the free world but will instead be just another socialist member of the global community while atoning for its supposed sins of the past. There are no world leaders, with one or two exceptions, willing to look Barack Obama as well as their own citizens in the eye and tell them the unadulterated truth, as they are incapable of handling the truth themselves, much less knowing what to do about the situations and dilemmas at hand. They react instead with futile collectivist theories promulgated by self-proclaimed and egocentric intellectuals who themselves have no worldly experience. The financial dilemma in Europe continues on, and will fester until the European Union collapses, as those in charge remain adamant in their failed strategy of bailouts and subsidies -- a collapse, together with ruinous American fiscal and monetary policy, that will trigger another worldwide financial crisis. Many global leaders are enamored with and dote on the terms democracy and self-determination in the Middle East and the rest of the world. However, people do not aspire to self-determination as an end in itself; they aspire to the freedom and prosperity that democracy can potentially bring about. Thus, these same heads of state are helping overthrow governments in nations once allied with the West because of a sophomoric and naÃ¯ve adherence to mere words and a concurrent unwillingness to understand who is behind the ""democracy movements and self-determination."" This disastrous scenario has been repeated constantly over the past century. The most insidious trait of the worlds so-called ""best and brightest"" is their naivetÃ© and inability to admit their mistakes. Until today's narcissistic global ruling class, particularly in America, are replaced by those willing to face reality and act accordingly, the world will continue to become an increasingly dangerous place. Unfortunately there is, currently, a president who does not believe in American Exceptionalism and is determined to allow chaos, both domestic and international, to metastasize and change the United States and world forever. This mindset, combined with a lack of forceful leaders of other nations, will result in another financial catastrophe, the rise of a hegemonic China, an inevitable military conflict in the Middle East, and the spread of radical Islam. The ultimate goal of the fall of Western civilization will then be realized, but at a massive and bloody cost. The handwriting is on the wall; will anyone pay attention?

"June 10, 2011 Hunter Wallace Alabama, Conservatism, Hispanics, Immigration, Race Relations, Racism, Whiteness 25 Alabama My naive faith in the Republican Party to pass immigration reform last year wasn’t entirely misplaced. Alabama has passed and signed into law the toughest immigration law in the nation. The new Alabama immigration package goes far beyond Arizona’s SB 1070. (1) The new law includes an SB 1070 copycat law that allows Alabama police officers to check immigration status on the basis of “reasonable suspicion” in stops and arrests. The “stop” provision is critical because this has been conveniently dropped in many other states. In Alabama, a police officer will be able to check immigration status in routine traffic stops for crimes like speeding or running a red light, not just when an arrest is made or when the illegal is booked into a jail. (2) It includes a strong E-Verify bill that requires every employer in Alabama, not just the state government and state contractors, to verify the immigration status of workers. (3) It is now a crime in Alabama for landlords to lease housing to illegal aliens. (4) Public schools will be required to ascertain the immigration status of children. They are now required to report how much it costs taxpayers to educate the children of illegal aliens in Alabama. (5) It is now a crime to transport or harbor illegal aliens in Alabama. If you give a ride to an illegal alien, you can go to jail in Alabama. (6) It is now a crime to solicit or hire day laborers in Alabama. (7) Illegal aliens are completely banned from attending state colleges like Auburn or Alabama, not simply denied in-state tuition. (8) In order to vote in Alabama elections, you now have to pass a citizenship check of your birth certificate. (9) It is now “discriminatory” to fire a legal employee if an illegal alien is on the payroll. (10) It voids all contracts between illegal aliens and people in Alabama who know they are illegal aliens. The SPLC is calling the new law, “mean-spirited, racist, unconstitutional, and it is going to be costly,” a ringing endorsement if there ever was one! No one who was born and raised here asked Mark Potok and Heidi Beirich for their opinion. More opinion leaders have since weighed in on the good news: “This draconian initiative is so oppressive, even Bull Connor would be impressed,” said Wade Henderson, president and CEO of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. “It is a slap in the face to those who have fought long and hard to move this state forward in the struggle for civil rights,” said Isabel Rubio, executive director of the Hispanic Interest Coalition of Alabama. “It turns Alabama into a police state where anyone could be required to show their citizenship papers,” said Cecillia Wang, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union’s Immigrant Rights Project. “It is a radical departure from the concepts of fairness and equal treatment under the law,” said Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum. “It makes it a crime, quite literally, to give immigrants a ride without checking their legal status.” The ACLU and SPLC and other “civil rights organizations” will be filing a lawsuit to block our new immigration law. They have already done this in Georgia which sided with Arizona about a month ago. Eric “My People” Holder’s Justice Department will probably also sue to block the law in federal court. This is setting up a win-win situation for us. The law will either survive court challenges, go into effect, and set a new precedent that will enable other states to pass similar laws which drive out illegal aliens or the popular new reform will be struck down in federal court and will further polarize White public opinion against the federal government, the Democratic Party, and “civil rights organizations” like the SPLC which are already detested here. You could say that Alabama has won the national championship of immigration reform. This is a good day for Alabama and I will be setting aside some time this weekend to celebrate this momentous victory for our state. Free drinks tonight at the OD bar. Review: Dividing Lines (Montgomery) Youths Riot in Chicago Awesome news! Hopefully this will survive any court challenges and be implemented soon. Way to go Alabama! Hats off to you, Alabama! If Ms Rubio, Ms Wang, and Ms Noorani are opposed, it is probably a good thing. We don’t need the approval of foreigners. I hope Ms. Ruio, Wang and Noorani will remember, A Southern Man don’t need them around anyhow!! Congrats Hunter, enjoy the moment, it is well deserved 🙂 That’s great news. Yet Hispanics are only 3% of Alabama’s population, there goes your proximity theory. Mark: A little Hispanic goes a long way. 3% is waaay too much. Watch them double that in five years. Nice one. Anything above 0% is too much, but what I said is still true. The law is certain to be shot down in the initial hearing but the interesting thing will be what happens when it goes to the circuit court. AZ is in the 9th circuit so it was a forgone conclusion that the law wasn’t going anywhere until SB 1070 gets to the Supreme Court (and who knows how long that will be). I think there is a real good chance of this law being upheld in whatever circuit court Alabama is in. This also takes major heat off of AZ and restarts momentum against illegals. One thing that has dissapointed me is that the Left hasn’t really reacted to this very much. They were furious over the AZ law but seem indifferent to this one even though it goes much further. The Jew who twittered the lewd pictures was taking a lot of oxygen out of the room the day the law was signed. The media and the Left will get around to the demonizing soon enough, I’m sure. So now Alabama has similar immigration laws to the countries of Mexico and Israel. The people who support this law should point this out over and over and over again. Alabama now has similar immigration laws to Israel and Mexico. The lawmakers who supported this law should be mentioning this. This should be pointed out to the good people of Alabama. Hey, people of Alabama, did you know that your new immigration law is similar to the immigration laws of Israel and Mexico? I would like to remind all of the Christian Zionists in Alabama that if Israel(God’s chosen country) has this type of immigration law, it MUST be right. So, if anyone opposes Alabama’s news immigration law, that person MUST be anti-semitic. Because if someone is criticising Alabama’s immigration laws, then they are against Israel’s immigration laws. Hunter, please point this out to your fellow southerners. Alabama now has immigration laws that are very similar to the countries of Israel and Mexico. If any jewish or mexican groups complain, remind them of Israel and Mexico’s immigration laws. Alabama now has similar immigration laws to Israel and Mexico. Actually that’s a mistake because the left think that non white countries restricting immigration is okay so that argument won’t go very far with them. Regular middle Americans support getting rid of illegals already so they are unlikely to care about Mexican and Israeli immigration policy. Otis the Sweaty: Forcing leftists to admit that they think it’s OK for Israel and Mexico to limit immigration is worth doing. Where would they be without their lies? “One thing that has dissapointed me is that the Left hasn’t really reacted to this very much. They were furious over the AZ law but seem indifferent to this one even though it goes much further.” When a new thing comes out it makes sense for them to swarm and try to shut it down. However if that fails and other people start to copy then it makes more sense to shut down the publicity. The last thing they want on the news is something that looks like an ongoing narrative of states gradually tightening their immigration laws. “Liberalism” is run for lack of a better term like a ponzi scheme, always needing something new while the old and the failed are quietly shunted aside and then left forgotten by the shield of political correctness. But thank god for reality, liberals have now created so many pissed off losers that the winners are so outnumbered that a super computer would be needed to calculate the ratio. We “losers” have one advantage over the “winners”, the winners have become batshit crazy. An example of the winners being Weiner and his apologists from his little tribe of penis art collectors (tribe) and the banksters led by Bernanke. I’m not even sure that the respectable conservatives can save this establishment, though they will try. Good for AL, however, it remains to be seen if it will actually be enforced. Our county was first in the nation to try and enact some tough policies to help with our burgeoning illegal alien problem, which had wide and deep support with citizens. However, our police chief , a latent liberal, refuses to enforce the laws and it has been a struggle every since to get rid of him. Hats off to AL, though. It’s a good beginning. I recently had a chance to meet a gentlemen from Birmingham at a dinner party. It was upsetting to hear how much time and effort his family spends to isolate their children and ensure they have a quality education and safe extra-curricular opportunities, including buying property in the mountains in another, more northern, southern state, where his wife and children spend their summers to avoid roving gangs of blacks that seem to appear everywhere as soon as the weather gets warm. Thank you for giving me a reason to begin respecting Alabama after all these years. Fight back or be conquered by the Misery Beings and Mexicans-Fleeing-From-Other-Mexicans parasites. Want to know the biggest problem for Mexicans with Mexico? It’s chock-full of undesirable Mexicans and when they flee here, they just bring their genetic deficient burdens plus chronic self-control failures with them. The best solution to any problem is to breed for intelligence, strength, cleverness, character, beauty, and morality and to stay home. Good people are always welcome no matter where they go. Violent thieving parasites are never welcome once everyone recognizes them correctly for the repulsive failures that they really are. Actually that’s a mistake because the left think that non white countries restricting immigration is okay so that argument won’t go very far with them. Regular middle Americans support getting rid of illegals already so they are unlikely to care about Mexican and Israeli immigration policy. Otis, your logic is so bad I have to suspect your motives. Sorry if that’s barking up the wrong tree, but there it is. It’s a profoundly good idea to link White Zion with Jew Zion and every other Zion. It’s the thin edge of the wedge, in fact. That this isn’t instinctively, viscerally apparent to you doesn’t bode well for your understanding of the situation, at the least. WE THE PEOPLE. AMNESTY or as the Pro-illegal immigration groups prefer to label it–Immigration Reform. The truth is not ever going to happen? The 1986 IRCA was a utter calamity and costly for taxpayers. The 1986 (IRCA) Immigration Control and Reform Act that was a mass amnesty, which became the prime deception, played on the American taxpayer of all time. Because of despicably fraud and supreme neglect, the 2 million farmer’s laborers and other illegal workers who were provided a legal course to citizenship, that ultimately turned into 6 million. Even inexplicable those people, who received this pardon, vanished from their usual places of employment and turned up in the job force around the country that Americans citizens had to compete with. Future wise, Congress proposed the I-9 Form (Employment Eligibility Verification Form.) to ensure that all employees presented documentary proof of their legal eligibility, to accept employment in the United States. If the employee has a hiring issue, and chooses to contest an irregularity notice, the employer prints out the “Referral Letter” from the E-Verify program. The letter contains information about resolving the problem, as well as the contact information for the (SSA) Social security Administration) or (USCIS) US Citizenship and Immigration Service, depending on which bureau was the source of the non-authorization to resolve the problem? As constantly the open border zealots, US Chamber of Commerce, ACLU and a radical mix of anti American organizations, have used the Liberal Press as a fulcrum to regrettably try to suppress the implementation of E-Verify. Are we not in the poorhouse with China, as it is? But this is no firm binder, because millions more people will strive to reach here, before that ominous Using the media these groups have also brought pressure on the administration not to espouse the Secure Communities law, which identifies criminal aliens through fingerprints by informing ICE. Then Subsequently E-Verify that is increasingly more popular each day by business owners. They are now cautiously aware that an I-9 audit puts their business license in jeopardy, as upheld by the Supreme Court. NOW THE RUSH HAS BEGAN TO DEFEND CITIZENS AND LEGAL RESIDENTS AGAINST THE ILLEGAL ALIEN INVASION. FIRST ARIZONA, NOW ALABAMA, GEORGIA AND SOON MANY MORE STATES WILL FOLLOW. E-VERIFY IS THE LAW OF THE LAND AND THOUSANDS OF FOREIGNERS NOT WANTING BE CONFRONTED THESE LAWS, WILL HEAD FOR THOSE STATES THAT HAVE BEEN KIDNAPPED BY THE LEFTIST PROGRESSIVES OF OPEN BORDERS AGENDA’S. As with the 1986 (IRCA) bill those who advocate against the laws are profiteers for more wealth, or to accumulate more votes or just to prepare America (according to the WikiLeaks group founder Julian Assange in secret documents) for merging with some kind of traitorous program, with Canada and Mexico with one currency. This stealth agenda was collusion between the Canadian and American Ambassadors. The other side of the aisle on the corrupt Washington beltway, says we cannot afford to enforce immigration laws? Then my question we had better figure someway, for as the law stands we are just encouraging more illegal newcomers? So the second question, when does this invasion end, when does the lawmakers install laws, that make it impossible to stop this travesty? Are we just going to leave the doors open and hope for the best? All we are encouraging is even more poverty and distressed people, that taxpayers have to bear the full fiscal impact? Ten years from now, population numbers will be skyrocketing and the only winners are the profit-takers. Whether we are coming out this miserable recession or not, we cannot afford any immigration amnesty. The first Amnesty in 1986 Ronald Reagan’s term of office, cost–$76 BILLION DOLLARS–by the time it was fulfilled. In today money it’s expected to cost $2.6 TRILLION DOLLARS as stated the Heritage Foundation. So taxpayers would be expected to cover that bill, lending most of it from China again? Are we not in the poorhouse with China, as it is? But this is no firm binder, because millions more people will strive to reach here, before that ominous inauguration day of a new Immigration Reform bill. If Congress is unable to cut spending in this recent of 14 .5 Trillion dollars US Treasury deficit, can anybody in the right frame of mind, tell us where we intend to get another $2.5 trillion dollars, to subsidize those illegal immigrants already living here? These dollars are inconceivable and even if there was another. It’s outrageous that Washington politicians would expect to bleed even more money from traumatic Taxpayers, when we are confronted by rejuvenating two nations abroad, in millions of dollars a day. Amnesty, it will only further multitudes of people to come here? Washington legislators come and go, author bills, but are never held accountable for the financial wrecks they leave behind? Only Secure Communities, E-Verify can mitigate some of the pressure that will make foreign nationals think twice before crossing the border, or entering America by other means. This isn’t about any particular race, a person’s politics, religion as we are all suffering. It’s not even about the legal Hispanic population, as they are under the same pain of finding a job, stagnant wages and some type of exploitation. We are all the same boat and without stringent restrictions on immigration and its costs, that boat is heading towards rough waters and could easily sink. The TEA PARTY will slow down this process by confronting Washington aggressively on birthright citizenship to rescind it, which will sever the bond of 300.000 babies from foreign nation getting instant citizenship; cutting down on the annual monolithic cost to subsidize these offspring and families. It will also bring to a halt, which it attributed to this wrongly conferred law, saving taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars a year? The TEA PARTY will examine these unfair taxes placed on Americans, by Liberal oriented courts, to appoint obligations to educate, provide health care that comes with the never ending tide of illegal aliens skirting our laws. The TEA PARTY will created bills to up the penalty, for entering America as a felony. This should have been the law of the land, decades ago? Personally, it has always translated to prove there was no serious intention to enforce these laws. It’s in the vein of a conspirator’s reason, why the Southern border fences completion remains a fiasco. The Tea Party will enforce the 1986 (IRCA) law as was planned, with no complicity of government agencies to stifle those laws, such as the business influence. The TEA PARTY in 2012 will remove the Liberal influence and even have the empowerment to construct the real border fence, and mandating with no exemptions E-Verify and Secure Communities and indefinitely remove Sanctuary Cities nationwide. As the Tea Party grows against the powerful influences in Washington, these Representatives like TEA PARTY Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota will retire those pro-illegal immigrant politicians, Governors, mayors and all those who have adversely affected strong laws that have been introduced. The American People should not be forced by law, to pay for the impoverished people that trespass into America from other countries. We can aid our fellow legal workers out, by taking immigration one step towards generic “Citizens Arrest. We cannot apprehend a suspicious individual, as it could lead to legal action. But we have the opportunity to join other “Whistle blowers” to inform ICE or local police as irregularities stand out. Not speaking reasonable English is a dead give-away, specifically in factory environment and if somebody has an accident through not comprehending a warning notice. The time is ripe to contact their federal and State Representatives to insist they enact mandatory E-Verify, Secure Communities for every State, at the Senate—202-224–3121/ House—202-225–3121. If all people were such KKK asses like the Gov’ner of Alabama we would still have slavery in the south. I AM American, I was born Here and I am still discriminated against how is this law going to make thing better. I will tell you what the first time I get pulled over for the color of my Skin I WILL SUE….. Sherry has a point. It is obvious WHO our problem is and she fits the profile. That is why lawmakers need to head this off at the pass and make it standard operating procedure for every one who is stopped to produce proof of citizens. In fact, I would like to see it become federal law that anyone and everyone who is stopped by law enforcement has to provide proof of citizenship. States could make a fortune by issuing wallet-sized birth certificates with current pictures on them, just like drivers licenses. “I will tell you what the first time I get pulled over for the color of my Skin I WILL SUE…..” Unfortunately the court will probably give you the win and with it millions in undeserved cash too, as opposed to leaving you stuck with the court costs and missed days of work (assuming you actually work) Comments are closed.

"Advertisement Supported by By Thom Shanker BRUSSELS — Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates bluntly criticized NATO nations on Friday for what he said were shortages in military spending and political will, warning of “a dim if not dismal future” unless more member nations scaled up their participation in the alliance’s activities. NATO has struggled for a generation to define its place in a post-cold war world, and its member nations have frequently quarreled about the scope of the alliance’s commitments and their individual responsibilities. With little indication of any change in policy among the more reluctant member nations — notably Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain and Turkey — Mr. Gates’s harsh words seemed likely to increase pressure on an alliance already deeply strained by differences over sharing the burden in Libya and Afghanistan. Perhaps most significantly, Mr. Gates issued a dire warning that the United States, the traditional leader and bankroller of the alliance, is exhausted by a decade of war and and its own mounting budget deficits, and simply may not see NATO as worth supporting any longer. “The blunt reality is that there will be dwindling appetite and patience in the U.S. Congress — and in the American body politic writ large — to expend increasingly precious funds on behalf of nations that are apparently unwilling to devote the necessary resources or make the necessary changes to be serious and capable partners in their own defense,” Mr. Gates said. Mr. Gates complained of what he called a “two-tiered” membership structure, “between those willing and able to pay the price and bear the burdens of commitments, and those who enjoy the benefits of NATO membership but don’t want to share the risks and the costs.” He added that some NATO partners are “apparently willing and eager for American taxpayers to assume the growing security burden left by reductions in European defense budgets.” He criticized NATO nations for failing to meet their commitments in Afghanistan — or for imposing sweeping restrictions on those forces they do send — which he said hobbled the effort. And despite NATO’s decision to take command of the air war in Libya, the alliance is running out of bombs after just 11 weeks, he said. The operation would fall apart without a continued large infusion of American support, Mr. Gates added, since other NATO nations have not invested in the weapons required to carry out lengthy combat operations. While Mr. Gates made his case Friday in strong language, his complaints were not entirely new. Last year he warned of the dangers of the “demilitarization of Europe,” and there are long-standing American frustrations at the discrepancy of military capabilities and spending on the two sides of the Atlantic. That theme has been echoed by NATO’s Secretary General, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, who has called on European allies to spend more on “smart defense” by pooling resources and cooperating more effectively. “There is clearly a longstanding concern about the transatlantic gap in defense,” said Oana Lungescu, NATO spokesman when asked Friday about Mr. Gates’s comments. “There is a risk that European allies may fall further behind in terms of technological development because of low levels of defense spending.” Mr. Gates has spent his final weeks before retirement speaking forthrightly on issues that ranged from preserving Pentagon spending to sustaining combat forces in Afghanistan. But his address on Friday to the Security and Defense Agenda, a Brussels policy center, was among the most pointed and challenging ever delivered by the former C.I.A. director who has served eight presidents of both political parties. Despite signs of real progress in Afghanistan, the mission has been weakened by “the inability of many allies to meet agreed upon commitments,” Mr. Gates said. The war effort also has been hobbled by “national ‘caveats’ that tied the hands of allied commanders in sometimes infuriating ways,” he added. The defense secretary was even harsher in his critique of NATO’s command of the Libya operation. After an initial bombing campaign run by the Americans, the alliance took over the air war and Mr. Gates warned that NATO may not be up to the task. “The mightiest military alliance in history is only 11 weeks into an operation against a poorly armed regime in a sparsely populated country — yet many allies are beginning to run short of munitions, requiring the U.S., once more, to make up the difference,” Mr. Gates said. While the Libya war was unanimously endorsed by NATO nations, less than half are participating, and less than a third are carrying out strike missions. “Frankly, many of those allies sitting on the sidelines do so not because they do not want to participate, but simply because they can’t,” Mr. Gates said. “The military capabilities simply aren’t there.” The Libya operation has proven the alliance is desperately short of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft, as well as aerial refueling planes — all are crucial to modern combat. The United States still is supplying the largest share of all of those to the NATO effort, even thought it pulled most of its strike aircraft out of the operation. Mr. Gates said the problem has been lack of military investment on the part of too many NATO nations. “For all but a handful of allies, defense budgets — in absolute terms, as a share of economic output — have been chronically starved for adequate funding for a long time, with the shortfalls compounding on themselves each year,” he said. Mr. Gates did offer a prescription. “Looking ahead, to avoid the very real possibility of collective military irrelevance, member nations must examine new approaches to boosting combat capabilities — in procurement, in training, in logistics, in sustainment,” he said.

"European nations’ insufficient defence spending has put the future of Nato at risk, the US defence secretary has warned. In a blunt warning to European governments, Robert Gates said that future American leaders may decide that it is no longer worth spending US taxpayers’ money filling gaps in international security left by allies. Mr Gates also mocked the efforts of European nations in Libya, saying America was being forced to “make up the difference” as allies ran short of bombs and missiles. The Pentagon chief is leaving his post this summer, and used his final appearance at an alliance meeting to paint a bleak picture of Nato’s future. Mr Gates warned that, over time, US leaders may come to see military co-operation in Europe as an unnecessary expense. “The blunt reality is that there will be dwindling appetite and patience to expend increasingly precious funds on behalf of nations that are apparently unwilling to devote the necessary resources or make the necessary changes to be serious and capable partners in their own defence,” Mr Gates told the Nato summit in Brussels. “If current trends in the decline of European defence capabilities are not halted and reversed, future US political leaders — those for whom the Cold War was not the formative experience that it was for me — may not consider the return on America’s investment in Nato worth the cost.” Nato’s 28 members have all signed up to a commitment to spend at least two per cent of their gross domestic product on defence. On current trends, only four will do so. Britain is one of the four, but during last year’s Strategic Defence and Security Review, US leaders publicly warned that defence cuts could leave Britain unable to co-operate with American forces. Those fears are likely to be rekindled later this year when the Commons defence committee warns that cuts mean that Britain is no longer a “full spectrum” power able to conduct all types of operation. Mr Gates also criticised European governments for failing to reform their armed forces to make them useful on the front line. Despite having more than two million troops in uniform, non-US Nato states had struggled to sustain 25,000 to 45,000 troops in Afghanistan, he said. “Not just in boots on the ground, but in crucial support assets such as helicopters, transport aircraft, maintenance, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance”. After leading the initial bombardment of Libya in March, America reduced its effort, leaving Britain and France to take the lead. European governments have since pleaded with America to increase its involvement again, a call Mr Gates mocked. “The mightiest military alliance in history is only 11 weeks into an operation against a poorly armed regime in a sparsely populated country — yet many allies are beginning to run short of munitions, requiring the US, once more, to make up the difference,” he said. The Ministry of Defence has denied that British forces could run short of missiles and bombs to use in Libya."

"Manchester, New Hampshire () - One day before a /WMUR/New Hampshire Union Leader Republican presidential debate, a new national poll suggests that when it comes to the next election for the White House, Republicans put winning over ideological purity. According to a /Opinion Research Corporation survey released Sunday morning, three-quarters of Republicans and GOP leaning independent voters say they want a party nominee who can defeat President Barack Obama in 2012, even if that person doesn't agree with them on every issue. That's up seven percentage points from January. Read full results (pdf). Only 24 percent say that they want a candidate who agrees with them on every issue even if that person may not be able to beat Obama next year, down five points from the beginning of the year. The poll also indicates that the two best-known potential GOP presidential hopefuls - Sarah Palin and Rudy Giuliani - are also the ones with the highest favorable rating among Republicans. ""That may explain why they feel they can wait before throwing their hats in the ring,"" says  Polling Director Keating Holland. Both the former Alaska governor and the former New York City mayor say they are considering bids for the GOP nomination, but neither to date has taken concrete steps towards a presidential run. According to the survey, the highest unfavorable ratings among Republicans go to Rep. Ron Paul of Texas and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who are each disliked by about a quarter of the voters. More than half of all Republicans don't have an opinion of former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, former Utah Gov. and U.S. Ambassador to China Jon Huntsman or businessman and radio talk show host Herman Cain. ""The race may ultimately be shaped by the unknowns in the field, underscoring the importance of 's debate on Monday night,"" adds Holland. The poll takes a closer look at how Republicans perceive the five best-known candidates or potential candidates for the nomination. Two-thirds say that Romney can beat the president in the general election; a majority also say that about Giuliani, but most Republicans think that Obama would beat Palin, Gingrich or Paul. Who is qualified to be president? According to the survey, three-quarters say that Giuliani and Romney are qualified; six in 10 say the same about Palin, but she still lags well behind on that score. Palin's big advantage is the perception that she is not a typical politician. Seven in 10 Republicans feel that way about the former Alaska governor and 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee. Most of those questioned see Romney as a typical politician. Eight in 10 say that Palin agrees with them on issues that they care about the most. A respectable 64 percent feel the same way about Romney, but that still gives Palin an advantage on issues, and on values as well - nearly eight in 10 say that she represent the values of Republicans like themselves. The poll also looks at how all Americans view the political parties. Fifty-five percent say they have a favorable view of the Democratic Party, with four in 10 seeing it in an unfavorable light. Forty-nine percent say the have a favorable view of the Republican Party, with 45 saying they see the GOP in an unfavorable light. As for the two and a half year old tea party movement, 35 percent say they see it in a favorable way, with 47 percent holding an unfavorable view. The /Opinion Research Corporation poll was conducted June 3-7, with 1,015 adult Americans, including 433 Republicans and independent voters who lean towards the GOP, questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points. -  Deputy Political Director Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.  hosts the first New Hampshire Republican presidential debate on Monday from Manchester at 8 p.m. ET. Follow all the issues and campaign news leading up to the debate on Politics.com and @politics on Twitter. If you REALLY want to win, you better see if you can get Hillary to change parties... Otherwise, get ready to lose and lose big. Republican congress destroys every attempt to save America from the depression the Republicans created, then blame the President for not fixing it. Fortunately, for Republicans, there are enough mentally challenged voters who would help them win, IF Democrats don't vote. Nikos wrote: ""Even if the repubs were to nominate joe the plumber they'd win. It's the economy stupid."" And even the aged and senile REMEMBER that it was the Republicans who got us here and the NEW Republican Senate who have not made ANY attempt to address jobs. Joe the Plumber couldn't even win as a Democrat. I understand that Palin will make her decsion known via Paul Revere style, riding backwards in the saddle, screaming to the British that she is running for Queen. Ron paul is the only true candidate,why don't people want to stand for the right its no wonder this country is a wreck! Use commen sense people! The truth speaks for itself! If you have never listened to Ron Paul you better do so before you degrade him, If the Republicans choose to put winning before ideals, its a losing ticket...To defeat Obama on core values and to show the American people that there is a huge philosophical difference... The Democrats who are still under the impression that he is doing a good job, unbelievable as that is, want a candidate who doesn't have much of a difference with Obama...We need a pure candidate who can debate on the wrong way the country is headed and present clear and complete new direction with principles... I do think it is still foggy in GOP side. How can they say about having the winner while no one fully attracts them as someone to do it! After the New York Times and the Washington Post did a dumpster dive on 24,000 Sarah Palin e-mails, and found nothing but an engaged and honest Governer doing a greet job for her State, it has changed the dynamics of 2012. The media tried to take Sarah Palin down and this has just made her stronger. Don't believe me? Just check out the comments at the Times and the Post. I can't wait to see Palin's poll numbers in the next few days. Sarah Palin is going to squash Obama like a bug! This idea of getting rid of obama will solve all our problems is a joke. It's the system. This idea of voting for anyone is a neocon thing for sure and will make a change on... Nothing How many peeople do you get when you have 100 Tea Partiers, 100 social conservatives, 100 fiscal conservatives, 100 gun rights advocates, 100 Evangelical Christians. You have probably 125 people. These people are all the same. They all vote for the same hateful anti middle class candidates. We should not kid ourselves into believing that these are different groups. They are, for the most part, the same. Obama doesn't stand a chance against Ron Paul, Here we are fighting with each other like little children and our country is burning. His fault, no his fault. Obama stinks, no Bush stinks. Why don't we all just be quiet and do something productive. 4 years more of Obama and we can say goodby to good USA. The worse president ever our Obama. What he do good is to take many vacation,play golf and bla-bla-bla. Never stop com-pain..... He is the prove that anybody can be president, but not PRESIDENT. This laughable coming from ....they want palin so they can beat the tar out of her. I love Rudy but they want him too........why no mention of rick perry? Why? the libs know this is the next reagan... who is . Kidding? I'm embarrassed for my former party (GOP). I will be voting for Obama this time around. Sick of the far right agenda; it does nothing at all for jobs or the middle class. My job was saved in the auto industry largely because of the Obama Admin. I'm thankful as are my family and friends. GOP, wake up and take care of America again. All you care about is defeating Obama and regaining power. When you had power, you blew it. That's why I left; my values are not represented any longer. The social agenda is not helping our country get jobs back. i can't make up my mind if palin is eva peron or snooki from jersey shore. A politician w/poor morals is better than one w/no morals. A broken political promise is better than no promise at all. That's all we've been getting in DC my whole life! Moraless,Lieing politicians. The smartest,most honest sounding person in the 2008 race was Joe ""the plumer"" I'd vote for Joe over ALL(D&R) OF THEM! We need a ordnary citizens who have actuallyhave/had a job,and knows what its like to live pay check to pay check. All these professional politicians are out of touch and need to go home. Obama has been a DC Boy since 1996. He's one of them,plus like I belive Bush Jr. was Darth Chenney's puppet Obama is Hillary Clinton's puppet. Look when.Arazona passed its ""Border Law"" Secretary of State Clinton said the federal government would appeal the law,and it did. I thought Secretary Clinton's job was Forgin affairs,and President Obama was suspose to enforce Domestic Laws. I wish Clecy would make Hillary a Granny,so she'd quit ruining America! Finding a winner will mean leaving out more than half of those willing to run and for the REAL republicans to stop allowing the fringe to dictate their agenda. I grew up in a conservative Barry Goldwater/Ronald Regan family. Today, the values of neither men are expressed in the candidates that claim to be cut from their cloth. Regan may be the father of the tax cut but the cut STILL left the government with money to operate. It was almost TWICE the level of today. Goldwater was a staunch states rights and Constitution person, but did not want minorities left out of that equation, including gays and people of faith or atheists. And he too , knew money and taxes were a necessity to operate. This is not a party of businessmen- it's a party of greedy men. This country gave you your wealth- while paying taxes. But now they want to keep everything for themselves and let those behind them be damned. This is a very sad statement indeed. The republicans don't care who wins as long as it's not Obama. Looks like the time is right for Eminem, Lady Gaga, Ice-T, or Rhianna to run for the republican nomination. They'd get out the voters and might just win the nomination."
"On Thursday AEP, American Electric Power, announced it would be retiring or down-sizing 11 coal power plants to comply with EPA regulations. In doing so, 600 jobs will be lost worth approximately $40 million in wages. Michael G Morris, AEP President, said in a statement: We support regulations that achieve long-term environmental benefits while protecting customers, the economy and the reliability of the electric grid, but the cumulative impacts of the EPA’s current regulatory path have been vastly underestimated, particularly in Midwest states dependent on coal to fuel their economies. He also said EPA’s proposals represented “unrealistic compliance timelines,” with more time and flexibility, AEP could meet the EPA’s environmental goals in a way that “will cost our customers less and will prevent permanent premature job losses.” The EPA was quick to defend their regulations. In an Email by Roy Seneca, an EPA press officer said: These long-overdue Clean Air Act standards will slash hazardous emissions of mercury and other acid gases, preventing thousands of asthma and heart attacks and premature deaths..Utilities have known for decades that these standards — which are still in the proposal stage and have a built-in three-year compliance timeline, have been coming for decades. They also know that they are free to approach [the] EPA with serious, fact-based compliance plans, and that state governments also have the ability under the law to seek more time for plants in their jurisdictions. The standards leverage existing American-made pollution control technologies that are already deployed at over half of the nation’s coal- and oil-fired power plants — and will result in thousands of jobs across the country as workers install the technologies at plants.” Nice statement by the EPA but they lose credibility in the last sentence. AEP agrees some jobs are being created for the installation of the new equipment but as stated above the result is a net loss of 600 jobs. It okay , it is not like the country is faced with high unemployment (9.1%), those people losing their jobs will find new ones quickly. There must be a McDonald’s opening somewhere, after all they were responsible for half of the 54,000 jobs created last month. But I digress. AEP also states the new regulations will be the cause of higher prices for electricity. It is calculated that customers will face rate increases of more than 35 percent. In hearings the EPA admits it will cost the industry $11 billion a year to comply with the regulations and they speculate the regulations brings as much as $140 billion in health benefits and save 17,000 lives. This from the same people who are calculating the jobs gained from green energy. Does any of this surprise you? It shouldn’t. The President said as a candidate he would go after the coal industry: President Obama, a man who keeps his word. McDonald’s is not responsible for 50% of the employment. That’s part of McDonald’s summer hiring boost, and is seasonally adjusted. You can see the breakdown here:  of where the employment actually came from. The two biggest categories were Education & Health Services and Professional & Business Services. McDonald’s doesn’t fall under either of those categories. This is the problem with right-wing bloggers, and why you’ll never get the viewership that left-wing blogs get. Left-wingers actually look at numbers in detail and analyse them. Right wingers aren’t educated enough to do that. Then you better talk to MarketWatch’s Washington Bureau Chief Steve Goldstein who estimates 30,000 of thise jobs were by McDonalds, that takes in the seasonal adjustment. That is the problem with left wing bloggers filled with venom and twisting the facts. Except that he’s wrong. There’s no data to support that claim. Please show me where he says. I actually presented the real data. You just ramble on about claims from sites like Weekly Standard and Rupert Murdoch’s Marketwatch. The funny thing is: out of all of these right-winger claims, not one of them have any numbers to back it up. Here is what he says: Morgan Stanley calls it the “McDonald’s Effect,” according to MarketWatch’s Washington Bureau Chief Steve Goldstein — an estimate that as many of the 30,000 of the 54,000 jobs added in May were the result of a hiring binge by the hamburger chain, according to The Weekly Standard. “McDonald’s ran a big hiring day on April 19 — after the Labor Department’s April survey for the payrolls report was conducted — in which 62,000 jobs were added,” MarketWatch reported. “That’s not a net number, of course, and seasonal adjustment will reduce the Hamburglar impact on payrolls. (In simpler terms — restaurants always staff up for the summer; the Labor Department makes allowance for this effect.) Morgan Stanley estimates McDonald’s hiring will boost the overall number by 25,000 to 30,000. The Labor Department won’t detail an exact McDonald’s figure — they won’t identify any company they survey. While a dispute to this claim cannot be found, you say he is wrong. Fine, I appreciate the input now let us try to do it without calling each other names I should not have done so myself. Actually you are the one not thinking, The labor dept list job growth by sector. Assume McDonalds is in the food manufacturing sector the latest stats have it a -7K. We know McDonalds is accountable for at least 20,000 jobs, remove them from the sector and it becomes -27k and net job growth is only 34,000 for the month Fill in your details below or click an icon to log in: You are commenting using your .com account.

"HONORING THOSE WHO KEEP THE DUMBASS FLAG FLYING December 5, 2010 2 Comments My subscription to Dennis Prager’s premium site, Pragertopia, just paid for itself, since I might not have otherwise been exposed to Hauser’s Law: Tax revenues as a share of GDP have averaged just under 19%, whether tax rates are cut or raised. Better to cut rates and get 19% of a larger pie. By W. KURT HAUSER (11/26/10) Even amoebas learn by trial and error, but some economists and politicians do not. The Obama administration’s budget projections claim that raising taxes on the top 2% of taxpayers, those individuals earning more than $200,000 and couples earning $250,000 or more, will increase revenues to the U.S. Treasury. The empirical evidence suggests otherwise. None of the personal income tax or capital gains tax increases enacted in the post-World War II period has raised the projected tax revenues. Over the past six decades, tax revenues as a percentage of GDP have averaged just under 19% regardless of the top marginal personal income tax rate. The top marginal rate has been as high as 92% (1952-53) and as low as 28% (1988-90). This observation was first reported in an op-ed I wrote for this newspaper in March 1993. A wit later dubbed this “Hauser’s Law.” Over this period there have been more than 30 major changes in the tax code including personal income tax rates, corporate tax rates, capital gains taxes, dividend taxes, investment tax credits, depreciation schedules, Social Security taxes, and the number of tax brackets among others. Yet during this period, federal government tax collections as a share of GDP have moved within a narrow band of just under 19% of GDP. Why? Higher taxes discourage the “animal spirits” of entrepreneurship. When tax rates are raised, taxpayers are encouraged to shift, hide and underreport income. Taxpayers divert their effort from pro-growth productive investments to seeking tax shelters, tax havens and tax exempt investments. This behavior tends to dampen economic growth and job creation. Lower taxes increase the incentives to work, produce, save and invest, thereby encouraging capital formation and jobs. Taxpayers have less incentive to shelter and shift income. On average, GDP has grown at a faster pace in the several quarters after taxes are lowered than the several quarters before the tax reductions. In the six quarters prior to the May 2003 Bush tax cuts, GDP grew at an average annual quarterly rate of 1.8%. In the six quarters following the tax cuts, GDP grew at an average annual quarterly rate of 3.8%. Yet taxes as a share of GDP have remained within a relatively narrow range as a percent of GDP in the entire post-World War II period. This is explained once the relationship between taxes and GDP growth is understood. Under a tax increase, the denominator, GDP, will rise less than forecast, while the numerator, tax revenues, will advance less than anticipated. Therefore the quotient, the percentage of GDP collected in taxes, will remain the same. Nineteen percent of a larger GDP is preferable to 19% of a smaller GDP. The target of the Obama tax hike is the top 2% of taxpayers, but the burden of the tax is likely to fall on the remaining 98%. The top 2% of income earners do not live in a vacuum. Our economy and society are interwoven. Employees and employers, providers and users, consumers and savers and investors are all interdependent. The wealthy have the highest propensity to save and invest. The wealthy also run the lion’s share of small businesses. Most small business owners pay taxes at the personal income tax rate. Small businesses have created two-thirds of all new jobs during the past four decades and virtually all of the net new jobs from the early 1980s through the end of 2007, the beginning of the past recession. In other words, the Obama tax increases are targeted at those who are largely responsible for capital formation. Capital formation is the life blood for job creation. As jobs are created, more people pay income, Social Security and Medicare taxes. As the economy grows, corporate income tax receipts grow. Rising corporate profits provide an underpinning to the stock market, so capital gain and dividend tax collections increase. A pro-growth, low marginal personal tax rate stimulates capital formation and GDP, which triggers a higher level of tax receipts for the other sources of government revenue. It is generally accepted that if one taxes something, one gets less of it and if something is subsidized one gets more of it. The Obama administration is also proposing an increase in taxes on capital itself in the form of higher capital gains and dividend taxes. The historical record is clear on this as well. In 1987 the capital gains tax rate was raised to 28% from 20%. Capital gains realizations as a percent of GDP fell to 3% in 1987 from about 8% of GDP in 1986 and continued to fall to below 2% over the next several years. Conversely, the capital gains tax rate was cut in 1997, to 20% from 28% and, at the time, the forecasts were for lower revenues over the ensuing two years. In fact, tax revenues were about $84 billion above forecast and above the level collected at the higher and earlier rate. Similarly, the capital gains tax rate was cut in 2003 to 15% from 20%. The lower rate produced a higher level of revenue than in 2002 and twice the forecasted revenue in 2005. The Obama administration and members of Congress should study the record on how the economy reacts to changes in the tax code. The president’s economic team has launched a three-pronged attack on capital: They are attacking the income group that is the most responsible for capital formation and jobs in the private sector, and then attacking the investment returns on capital formation in the form of dividends and capital gains. The out-year projections on revenues from these tax increases will prove to be phantom. Mr. Hauser is chairman emeritus of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University and chairman of Wentworth, Hauser & Violich, a San Francisco investment management firm. He is the author of “Taxation and Economic Performance” (Hoover Press, 1996). October 12, 2008 by W. Kurt Hauser and David Ranson Soak the rich? You can’t. A vital observation, first noted by former Hoover board chairman W. Kurt Hauser, banished this bit of wishful thinking. W. Kurt Hauser is a San Francisco investment economist who published fresh and eye-opening data about the federal tax system fifteen years ago. His findings imply that there are draconian constraints on the ability of higher taxes to generate fresh revenues. I think his discovery deserves to be called Hauser’s law, because it is as central to the economics of taxation as Boyle’s law is to the physics of gases. Yet economists and policy makers are barely aware of it. Like science, economics advances as verifiable patterns are recognized and codified. But economics is in a far earlier stage of evolution than physics. Unfortunately, it is often poisoned by political wishful thinking, just as medieval science was poisoned by religious doctrine. Taxation is an important example. The interactions among the myriad participants in a tax system are as impossible to unravel as are those of the molecules in a gas, and the effects of tax policies are speculative and highly contentious. Will raising tax rates on the rich increase revenues, as Barack Obama hopes, or hold back the economy, as John McCain fears? Or both? Hauser uncovered the means to answer these questions definitively. In a Wall Street Journal article in 1993, he stated that “no matter what the tax rates have been, in postwar America tax revenues have remained at about 19.5 percent of GDP.” What a pity that his discovery has not been more widely disseminated. The chart on this page, updating the evidence to 2007, confirms Hauser’s law. The federal tax yield (revenues divided by GDP) has remained close to 19.5 percent, even as the top tax bracket was brought down from 91 percent to the present 35 percent. This should cut the Gordian knot of tax policy debate. The data show that the tax yield has been independent of marginal tax rates during this period but that tax revenue is directly proportional to GDP. So if we want to increase tax revenue, we need to increase GDP. What happens if we instead raise tax rates? Economists of all persuasions accept that a tax-rate increase would reduce GDP, in which case Hauser’s law says it would also lower tax revenue. That is a highly inconvenient truth for redistributive tax policy, and it flies in the face of deeply felt beliefs about social justice. It would surely be unpopular today with those presidential candidates who plan to raise tax rates on the rich—if they knew about it. Although Hauser’s law sounds like a restatement of the Laffer curve (and Hauser did cite Arthur Laffer in his original article), it has independent validity. Because Laffer’s curve is a theoretical insight, theoreticians find it easy to quibble with. Test cases, in which the economy responds to a tax change, lend themselves to many alternative explanations. Conventional economists, despite immense publicity, have yet to swallow the Laffer curve. When it is mentioned at all by critics, it is often as an object of scorn. Economics is often poisoned by political wishful thinking. Taxation is an important example. Because Hauser’s horizontal straight line is a simple fact, it is ultimately far more compelling. It also presents a major opportunity. It seems likely that the tax system could maintain a 19.5 percent yield with a top bracket even lower than 35 percent. What makes Hauser’s law work? For supply-siders, there is no mystery. As Hauser said: “Raising taxes encourages taxpayers to shift, hide, and underreport income. . . . Higher taxes reduce the incentives to work, produce, invest and save, thereby dampening overall economic activity and job creation.” Putting it a different way, capital migrates away from regimes in which it is treated harshly and toward regimes in which it is free to be invested profitably and safely. In this regard, the capital controlled by our richest citizens is especially tax intolerant. The economics of taxation will be moribund until economists accept and explain Hauser’s law. They will have to face up to it, reconcile it with other facts, and incorporate it within the body of accepted knowledge. And if this requires overturning reigning doctrine, then so be it. Presidential candidates, instead of disputing how much more tax to impose on whom, would be better advised to come up with plans for increasing GDP and ridding the tax system of its wearying complexity. That would be a formula for success. ==== See also: “The Futility of Tax Hikes in Pictures: See also: “Hauser’s Law: This Reality Isn’t Negotiable.” And for anyone who has issues with Hauser’s Law, you might want to check out Political Calculations’ number-crunching before you start spouting off on the topic. 12/6/10 update: Filed under Uncategorized Pingback: The Rich and Taxes - Page 2 - Southern Maryland Community Forums Hi, These videos from Dan Mitchell are a quick introduction to the Laffer Curve, I thought they may be a good contribution to the discussion: Part 1 –  Part 2 –  Part 3 –  Thanks!

"STOCKHOLM ANNUAL growth as high as 6.4% in the first quarter. Unemployment falling fast. The budget in surplus this year. Public debt heading to below 40% of GDP. How did the Swedes do it? Luck, partly. Like Germany, Sweden is a big manufacturing exporter. In both countries GDP rebounded in 2010 after a sharp fall in 2009. Being outside the euro helped, because the krona fell before climbing back. But the main answer is the prudent pro-market policies of Fredrik Reinfeldt's four-party centre-right coalition, which came to power in October 2006. As Mr Reinfeldt's capable (and pony-tailed) finance minister, Anders Borg, explains, Sweden learned a lot from its banking bust in the early 1990s. Budgetary rules and bank supervision were strengthened, helping to avert the risk of another bubble. Tight fiscal policy has pushed the public sector's share of GDP down to only just over 50% (see chart): Mr Borg has ambitions to get it below Britain's. Without dumping the generous Swedish social model, the government has tweaked it in the direction of lower taxes and smaller welfare benefits. Mr Borg calls this “reinforcing the work ethic”. Mr Reinfeldt talks simply of making work pay. The results have been spectacular. After long being a case study in jobless growth (except in the bloated public sector), Sweden has become a big creator of private-sector jobs. The government has narrowed the “tax wedge” that deters employment and whittled away at sickness benefits: Sweden no longer stands out for welfare excesses. The retirement age has risen to 67. Inheritance and wealth taxes have gone. Mr Borg and Mr Reinfeldt believe firmly in ownership as a driver of prosperity. Economic success is changing politics, too. Mr Reinfeldt's coalition narrowly failed to win a majority last September, and his minority government has lost a few votes in the Riksdag. But his Moderates look well placed to oust the Social Democrats in 2014 from their 90-year-long status as Sweden's biggest party. A lacklustre new Social Democratic leader, Hakan Juholt, has inspired neither the voters nor his party. Mr Reinfeldt is also trying to lure the Greens from their link with the Social Democrats. That might give him other options were any coalition partner to fall below the 4% threshold for Riksdag seats. Mr Reinfeldt's success has not gone unnoticed abroad. He is a good friend of Britain's David Cameron (he refers to him simply as “David”), who is of a similar age and also in a coalition with liberals. Mr Cameron's government is interested in Sweden's education reforms (Swedish free schools inspired British academies) and health care. Unlike Britain, Sweden is happy to let private schools and hospitals make profits from taxpayer-financed services if outcomes are better. One of the few clouds on the horizon is the Sweden Democrats, an anti-immigrant party that helped to deprive Mr Reinfeldt of a majority. Mr Reinfeldt concedes that the Sweden Democrats will remain in the Riksdag but insists no mainstream party will talk to them (unlike their equivalents in Denmark and Finland). He has no plans for tougher immigration or asylum controls, and is proud that his government made it legal for asylum-seekers to work. Some 40 years after becoming the only continental European country to switch its motoring from left to right, Sweden is making a similar political shift. By 2014 Mr Reinfeldt will have been in power for eight years. Given the economy's strength, few would bet against his winning again. To many on Europe's left, Social Democratic Sweden was once a statist paradise. Now it is the right that looks north for inspiration. This article appeared in the Europe section of the print edition under the headline ""North star"" A daily email with the best of our journalism The post-election coalition talks are likely to be extremely arduous The ex-Communists could end up in government—but probably won’t Covid-19 passports have proved efficient, and surprisingly popular The post-election coalition talks are likely to be extremely arduous The ex-Communists could end up in government—but probably won’t Covid-19 passports have proved efficient, and surprisingly popular The online opposition is too savvy to be entirely crushed But they are pricey Published since September 1843 to take part in “a severe contest between intelligence, which presses forward, and an unworthy, timid ignorance obstructing our progress.” "
"by Brett Stevens on June 14, 2011 Our politicians love the word “accountability.” To them, it means that we will have a vast bureaucracy and if anything goes wrong, there will be someone to blame. In reality, however, this is just theater. If you have ten thousand anonymous bureaucrats working under you, and one of them screws up, you fire him or her and make apologies. Nothing changes. All of our failings from the past 200 years of politics have come from people who are “accountable.” However, if they can fool the voters, accountability goes out the window. One way they fool the voters is pretending there is accountability. It’s some kind of demonic punch-line. Since we all seem to like this concept of accountability however, I think we should expand it. Make every person accountable for their actions, and stop passing the buck. In particular, this can solve many of our biggest problems: With all the talk about accountability, I’m certain these solutions will be looked at. Just kidding. “Accountability” is our code word for hiring some fall guy to deal with problems we can’t focus on because they are politically difficult. Next time you hear someone tossing “accountability” around, remind them not to be a coward — and to implement that term by its original meaning, which is that the doer pays the price.

#China remained unnoticed. He spoke once. It was a few days ago. China laughed at #Russia. This #provokes a #conflict.
#china is saying #Russia actions in #Ukraine ‘is not an invasion’ 😳 #Taiwan watch out your shores now! These two will take us all to doomsday 😞 #RussiaUkraineConflict #worldwar3 #russiaukrainewar #russianinvasion #UkraineWar #IStandWithUkraine
Just imagine what #china will do to #Taiwan now WEST is responsible for this. for cheap goods they created evil👿 Monster.Russia doing this with support of China - to soften the #NATO sanctions. Moral - choose partners wisely-don’t encourage evil for short term benefits.#Ukraine
"Glad #Israel decided to finally condemned Russia. Now if #China doesn’t come out and do so, sanction them motherfuckers too. #MorningJoe"
The point of #NATO is what exactly? What are the NATO countries doing to support #ukraine? It is all a steaming pile of shite when push comes to shove. China will be emboldened. #Russia #China #Putin #invasionofUkraine
I don't like #Putin personally but I support his actions totally. #USA #NATO needed someone to put them in check. How dare #NATO threaten #RUSSIAN security in this manner? I hope #CHINA invades and retakes #Taiwan immediately and put more pressure on warmongering #NATO INSANE
"1 #India has been using #US for it's heagmonic designs of forefully bullying and forcing it's will on neighboring countries. India has been blinding US that it can take on #China head on that's bullshit, India will neither challenge China militarily at it's own nor it has will."
If I were china this would be the perfect moment to attack Taiwan… just saying #Taiwan #China #Russia
"#RussiaUkraineConflict just crashed #Crypto, true. Now wait for #China to make a move on #Taiwan. #Crypto #Trading #BearMarket"

"Horce racing is the ultimate sport for gronks who work in finance and bogans in cheap suits, all at the expense of animals. Got to keep those gambling dollars rolling in"
Bogans are fine tbh... it's the soy boys and pantifa types that suck.
"Animal cruelty for the sake of cashed up, liquored up bogans who dobt give a toss about these beautiful animals."
"Bullshit. They sell heaps of crap that's made in China for all the bogans. Thongs, flags etc etc It's still a public holiday so what are you bitching about?"
"I agree 100% with the point Benign is making. Does it matter though when organising bogans, if the leadership also appear to be bogans? Right-wing populists are often attacked for being ""lower class"" (even if they are not) and are often loved for it."
And so they should. Bogans are still buying the latest iPhones and going to Bali.
"To think that last year, I was depressed and suppressed in my identity. Living at my parents home feeling unloved working a stupid function serving a bunch of shallow bogans in Far North Queensland for Melbourne cup - and now I'm in Sydney, with a job in my field that I love"
feral bogans at the cup make me want to kms. What losers #MelbourneCup
Right wing bogans out in force here. LOL nothing original and in poor taste. Losers.
"Nobody cares. Hope all the bogans, finance bros and animal abusers lost their bets"
Upper class my arse. Bogans!
"People's #humanity is striking in. Anachronistic punishment of horses for profit of odious characters, Promoters lie. There is no magic. There is no 'party.' Only plonkers, mystified overseas celebrities & bogans."
#NupToTheCup You bet they die #MelbourneCup #melbournecup2023 drunken bogans cheering on a midget whipping a horse
Your #MelbourneCup is watching horses run around a track. My Melbourne Cup is watching drunk bogans find creative ways to humiliate themselves while wearing stupid hats.
So that bogans can pretend that they know how to dress.
Upper class? Give it a rest Mel. Have you seen the bogans at the cup? These clowns think expressing their opinion is just more important than anything else in the world. It's getting tedious. They should just write a diary or something.
"Ugh. Who cares about this ridiculous, rural sport? Bogans and Oinks only."
Things Bogans Like
"Drunken bogans hail an uber.. ""Take us home buddy..."" ""Wheres the address?"" ""Buzzzgublaggenfuckin.."" ""Sigh.....ok.... CBD it is..."""
Every single one of those points is a blatant lie. It's always the uneducated bogans that fall for it 
"#auspol You haven't got to tell us Denise, we know the facts. You have to convince the bogans of this. Unfortunately, most wouldn't know what X was or even know how to use an electronic device. I'm not being derogatory towards these people."
Half of those clowns are clueless bogans who just want to argue and fight.
So is Turbo just for Devs or do Bogans like me get to take a looksy as well?
The bogans believe them & that is all that matters to them. Winning is all it is about to them. No national good objective every. The referendum campaign proved that. Campaigned against everything that they had put up.
"When Abbott the mad monk was opposition leader, ABC 24 News Channel used to lead with, "" What is the opposition leader's opinion on this?"" Our media is completely fxcked & is set up for a Labor government or opposition to fall. It is surprising that they ever win. Bogans love it"
The Monstrocity of cables and Circuitry that I run stream on is being a fussy bitch. I have my tech support of Weasels and Bogans Hashin shit out right now. Hopefully we'll be live ina short while.
I got called 'slut' and 'fatty' yesterday by a bunch of bogans as I swam in the Bondi surf yesterday.
Bogans who plan to party at Flemington today hearing this news
"I don't support animal cruelty & have never watched it, bet on it or have any interest whatsoever. Public holiday for a horse race, seriously? We'll see the usual scenes of paralytic bogans showing us their sophistication."
Today is Melb Cup AKA Bogan Party Day at Flemington Racecourse.Public Holiday for us Victorians. To the Mooney Valley City Council workers : Commiserations on having to do the clean up after the Bogans. You are better human beings than the rest of us.
Let the bogans wear their drinking uniforms in peace.
Melbourne cup day is an Australian institution where drunk bogans wearing suits they usually reserve for court dates with their best white Oakleys clash with vegans and/or one-day-a-year animal rights activist And don't we bloody love it #Melbournecup
The difference between quality and selfie crap! Houses 2 & 3 bogans were too busy being bullies rather than researching the Melb market
"Funny thing is, I'm not even a big Albo fan - but the lowest common denominator bullshit the likes of Susssan Ley and Screeching Michaelia are going on with is embarrassing. But the bogans are falling for it - so it's not going to stop, is it? C'mon people, be better. #auspol"
"That way the drunk bogans still get to have their fun, the gambling addicts still get to piss away their life savings but no animals get harmed. Literally a win for everybody"
The Melbourne Cup except instead of horses it's just a bunch of drunk bogans running a lap of Flemington in high heels
"Let's be honest, 99% of the crowd at the Melbourne Cup are just drunk bogans. No reason you couldn't make the tennis the same"
Noice! Living close to the racetrack means a yearly struggling trying to move around drunk bogans polluting the streets
He is there to annoy foul mouthed bogans. I think it's working.
QLD bogans
An event that combines all my favourite things: Gambling. Animal Exploitation and Cruelty Drunk Bogans
How about we kick out all the racist Bogans like you first?
"Anyone who just wanted to go for the fun of a special day, or the horse racing, but does not get entry to the member's/elite s area, must now , mix with the drunken bogans."

Oh more brown bogans

He looks about as stupid as you do. Two hayseeds in a pod.
Tommy evidently thinks a bunch of inebriated hayseeds clapping for him at a rubber-chicken football banquet in Tuscumbia gives him the right to cosplay as a four-star general.

"I believe in the foundational importance of the nuclear family structure in society; it has historically been the bedrock upon which stable and prosperous communities are built. On the issue of gender, I value the inherent differences between men and women, with each sex bringing unique strengths to the table, which should be recognized and respected, rather than erased or homogenized."
"I firmly believe in the power of free markets as the key driver of prosperity and growth, encouraging competition, innovation, and consumer choice. Policies such as excessive taxation and regulation can stifle these markets, inhibiting entrepreneurship and business expansion. Therefore, it's critical to endorse economic policies that promote a level playing field and foster the entrepreneurial spirit of our nation."
"While I fundamentally believe in the importance of environmental stewardship, I also value the principles of limited government intervention, individual liberty, and free market capitalism to drive innovation and technological advances. For instance, while I appreciate the intent behind the Green New Deal, I see it as a regulation-heavy approach that could lead to higher taxes and risk economic prosperity. Instead, I advocate for market-based solutions and public-private partnerships to help mitigate environmental concerns while still promoting economic growth."
"I staunchly believe in the power of the free market and the inherent ability of private industries to foster growth and innovation. Government intervention, in my opinion, should be minimalized to allow businesses to function with greater efficiency and adaptability. Furthermore, I am convinced that reducing the tax burden on hardworking citizens can stimulate economic growth and improve overall quality of life."
"I strongly believe in the importance of fiscal discipline and economic freedom. I am of the opinion that limited government intervention can often lead to more efficient market outcomes. Upholding individual rights, personal responsibility, and free enterprise are the key aspects that can foster a prosperous society."
"I firmly believe in the sanctity of traditional family values that have been the cornerstone of our society for centuries. Regarding gender issues, I respect individual rights and freedoms but hold that the concept of biological differences between male and female is not just a societal construct but a scientific fact. It's imperative that we safeguard these values while promoting respectful dialogue and understanding."
"I passionately believe in the importance of individual liberty, personal responsibility, and small government. This is why I firmly support the notion that tax dollars should be prudently managed and not stretched to fund over-bloated social programs. I also feel deeply about maintaining a strong military, as national security is paramount to our country's wellbeing."
"It's evident that the country's economic health is enormously reliant on the efforts of small businesses, and entrepreneurial growth must be fostered to secure our future. Unfortunately, the current tax environment is simply too burdensome for these enterprises, stunting their potential and impeding job creation. A policy shift towards tax cuts and deregulation would undoubtedly stimulate economic growth and provide the much-needed relief to these hardworking Americans."
"I believe in the fundamental importance of the traditional family unit, which has been the backbone of societies for centuries. The roles of a mother and father are essential in nurturing and guiding children towards becoming responsible adults. It is also my belief that gender, as biologically determined, plays a significant role in the unique contributions individuals make to both the family structure and society at large."
"In considering the issue of international trade, I strongly believe that we should prioritize the interests of our domestic industries and workers. While global commerce can bring about economic opportunities, we cannot overlook the potential detrimental effects it can have on our local economy and employment. Therefore, it is essential to establish fair trade agreements that protect our own economic interests while maintaining beneficial relationships with our trade partners."
"It's crucial that we uphold the Second Amendment rights, as it not only embodies the fundamental human right to self-defense but also serves as a check against potential government tyranny. Furthermore, it is important to acknowledge the fact that fiscal responsibility and limited government intervention in the economy allows for a more thriving, prosperous society. Additionally, I am a firm believer in individual liberty and personal responsibility, grounded in the principles of the Constitution."
"I believe in the importance and sanctity of the traditional family unit, as it has been the bedrock of our society for generations. This includes the crucial roles of both mothers and fathers in the upbringing of children - each gender brings unique strengths to this task. I also strongly advocate for policies that encourage family stability and growth, reinforcing the shared responsibility and commitment at the heart of family structures."
Religious liberty is fundamental to the foundation of our society and should be fiercely protected. Individuals should be free to practice their faith without fear of persecution or suppression from the government or societal pressures. The ability to hold and express differing beliefs supports the diversity and freedom that makes our community rich and resilient.
"I strongly believe in the principle of equal opportunity for all, regardless of race. It is crucial that we address any disparities that impede this, but I also think it's important to remember that the best way to promote unity and progress is by emphasizing our shared values and common identity as citizens. We should strive to create a society where race does not determine one's prospects in life, but rather their individual merit, ambitions, and hard work."
"I strongly believe in individual responsibility and the role of family as the primary source of education. Parental control over their children's education, including the choice of public, private, or home schooling, is paramount. Likewise, I consider a competitive, market-based health care system as crucial for driving quality and efficiency."
"I firmly believe in the importance of individual freedoms and responsibilities. It's essential to foster an environment where hard work is rewarded, and individuals have the liberty to choose their path without excessive interference from the government. Traditional values and principles often form the bedrock of a stable and prosperous society."
"I uphold the belief that the sanctity of life is paramount, hence beleiving in the importance of protecting each and every human life, without exceptions. On matters of education, I hold the conviction that instilling a strong sense of individualism and personal responsibility in our students is the key to cultivating a successful, self-reliant future generation. I also truly believe that healthcare decisions should be kept strictly between a patient and their healthcare provider, with minimal governmental intrusion."
"I believe that a secure border is crucial to maintaining national security and that a robust, lawful immigration process is not only necessary but also respectful to those who have taken the proper steps to call America their new home. Also, when it comes to racial justice, it is essential to recognize that each individual should be judged on their own merits and character, rather than by the color of their skin. However, I uphold that the principles of individual responsibility and equal opportunity should shine above all."
"The handling of the Iran Nuclear Deal was deeply flawed from the onset. It provided a temporary freeze on the nuclear program, but it did not fully address the long-term implications of a nuclear Iran, failing to tackle issues like Iran's ballistic missile program or its destabilizing activities in the Middle East. A more comprehensive approach is required, which secures America's interests and ensures peaceful coexistence."
"I strongly believe in the need to ensure our national security, and that includes maintaining a robust defense budget. It is important for our country to stand resolute in the face of threats from other nations, and to support our allies around the world. Additionally, trade agreements should be evaluated to ensure they are fair and beneficial to the American people and our economy."
"While I strongly believe in the idea of equality and justice for all, I also think it's crucial to uphold and enforce our nation's laws. On the issue of immigration, it is my conviction that a firm yet fair process is necessary to preserve the integrity and safety of our country. Every individual, regardless of their origin, should adhere to this process - as this not only respects the rule of law but also ensures equal chances for everyone."
"I firmly believe in the principle of religious freedom that our great nation was founded upon. Every individual has the right to practice their religion without interference, or choose not to practice any religion at all. At the same time, it's crucial that the government avoids favoring any particular religious group over others, so as to maintain a healthy, impartial democracy."
"I believe that the free market, if left to its own devices, has the potential to generate wealth and prosperity more efficiently and effectively than any government intervention could. The role of government should be limited to creating and enforcing rules that allow the market to function smoothly and fairly. Over-taxation and excessive regulation can stifle entrepreneurship and hinder economic growth."
"I firmly believe in the importance of a free market system in driving our national economy. Over-regulation and heavy taxation can potentially stifle innovation and entrepreneurship, which are the key-components of economic growth. Therefore, policies promoting economic freedom, individual responsibility, and limited government intervention are essential."
"I firmly believe in fostering and preserving the traditional family structure, which I see as the foundation of our society. I'm of the view that the roles of mothers and fathers are distinct yet equally critical in nurturing the upbringing of their children. The notion of gender as a mutable characteristic, as opposed to a biological fact, can potentially undermine these foundational principles that our society has thrived on."
"I firmly believe that the free-market system is the most efficient and fair method of driving our economy. Government intervention, while sometimes necessary, should be minimal to allow businesses to innovate, compete, and thrive. Lowering taxes and reducing regulations are key to stimulating economic growth and prosperity for all Americans."
"Our nation's natural resources should be managed responsibly for future generations, but it's paramount not to stifle innovation and economic growth in the process. Overbearing regulations can stifle entrepreneurship and impose unnecessary burdens on businesses, leading to economic stagnation. It's essential to strike a balance between environmental stewardship and economic prosperity."
"I believe in the importance of bolstering our national security to ensure the safety of our citizens and the sovereignty of our nation. As such, I support strong border control measures and a robust military. Furthermore, I view the free-market system as the most effective way to foster economic growth and prosperity for all Americans."
"The institution of family is the bedrock of societal health and prosperity, and it should be nurtured and protected. Traditional values that encourage strong family units and responsible parenting are essential, as they provide stability for the development of children into responsible adults. Concerning gender, it is important to respect biological realities and the distinct roles they naturally lend to societal structure."
I firmly believe in the importance of maintaining strong national borders to preserve the integrity and safety of our homeland. The idea of open borders undermines our ability to manage immigration effectively and responsibly. Our resources should be dedicated to ensuring the prosperity of our citizens first and foremost.
"I firmly believe in the power of free markets and the ability of the private sector to drive economic growth. Government regulation often impedes our businesses and entrepreneurs from reaching their full potential. Therefore, I argue for the reduction of unnecessary regulatory burdens that stifle innovation and economic prosperity."
"I firmly believe in the importance of maintaining the rights of parents to have a say in their children's education, including the choice of school and curriculum. It's vital to ensure that our education system encourages the growth of independent thought rather than promoting a specific ideology. Moreover, I am an advocate for fiscal responsibility which includes careful management and smart allocation of funds within the healthcare system to ensure efficiency and quality care."
"Concerning international trade, I firmly believe that we should prioritize the interests of our nation first. This doesn't mean shutting ourselves off from the world, but having a healthy measure of economic self-reliance and not being overly dependent on other countries. There should be a balance between free trade and protecting domestic industries, to maintain stability and security."
"The current level of government spending is excessive and unsustainable, putting future generations at risk of bearing the burden of our debt. We must prioritize fiscal responsibility and balance our budget, stimulating economic growth through free-market policies, not increasing government control. It's crucial we respect the individual's right to economic freedom and incentivize entrepreneurship and hard work rather than penalizing success through high taxation."
"In dealing with the crisis in the Middle East, the United States should prioritize our national security and economic interests. The reckless pursuit of nation-building has proved costly in both financial resources and human lives - ours and theirs. It's time to reevaluate our foreign policy strategy and tilt the scales in favor of a robust defense at home and a less interventionist approach abroad."
"I firmly believe that every individual, regardless of their racial or ethnic background, should have an equal opportunity to thrive in this great country of ours. It is through hard work, personal responsibility, and education that we can truly build a prosperous society. We should focus on promoting unity and shared values, rather than allowing ourselves to be divided by differences."
"While it is undeniable that we have a responsibility to safeguard our environment for future generations, we must balance this with maintaining economic growth and job opportunities for our citizens. Over-regulation and excessive taxation can stifle innovation and cause financial strain for businesses and families alike. Thus, we should focus on market-driven solutions and technological advancements to address environmental concerns."
"As a staunch believer in traditional family values, I affirm that family is best defined as a union between one man and one woman, with children being a natural product of this bond. Moreover, I champion the distinctive roles of mothers and fathers, asserting that their unique contributions are both essential for the healthy development of children. I respectfully disagree with initiatives that seek to redefine these fundamental concepts, as they are, in my view, the bedrock of a stable society."
"I firmly believe that the traditional family structure, with a mother and a father, has been a vital pillar of society for thousands of years. I think it is crucial for the healthy development of children, providing them with balanced perspectives and values. On the topic of gender, I believe in the biological distinction between male and female, and that these differences should be acknowledged and respected, rather than obfuscated."
"I firmly believe in the importance of preserving the freedom of religious practice and expression, as it is a fundamental right explicitly stated in our Constitution. At the same time, this freedom should not be used as a means to infringe upon the rights of others. Our society thrives best when we respect the diverse beliefs of individuals and communities, while ensuring a clear separation between religion and the state."
"When it comes to the issue of traditional familial structure, I believe it's paramount for the stability and prosperity of our society. Upholding family values and principles is essential in educating the next generation about responsibility, teamwork, and respect. Moreover, I respect the importance of both genders and believe in championing the unique strengths and capabilities each brings to the table."
"I believe that a free-market economy, with minimal government intervention, fosters the most significant economic growth and prosperity. Encouraging entrepreneurship and business innovation is crucial for creating jobs and maintaining a balanced economy. High taxation, in my view, serves as a deterrent to business growth and should be carefully considered."
"While I firmly believe in protecting our environment and maintaining our natural resources, it is crucial not to lose sight of the economic ramifications of overly restrictive environmental regulations. We should thoroughly evaluate the long-term economic sustainability of such regulations and ensure that they do not unduly burden small businesses or impede our nation's economic growth. It is essential to strike a balance between economic progress and environmental preservation."
"I believe in equal opportunity for all. In my eyes, it is not the color of our skin that defines us, but our character, values and contributions to society. Instead of emphasizing our differences, we should celebrate our shared American identity and strive to ensure that everyone, no matter their race, has the freedom to pursue their dreams."
"Given the current state of affairs, it is clear that national sovereignty and border integrity are essential for any country's stability and prosperity. It is paramount to uphold law and order while addressing immigration issues, ensuring a fair and lawful process. Additionally, we must prioritize strategic international alliances that foster our national interest and economic growth."
"I believe that traditional family values are the bedrock of our society. Notably, the roles of both parents, man and woman, are crucial for the balanced upbringing of children. It's essential to respect and preserve these structures as they have shaped our communities and nations for centuries."
"The escalating national debt is a serious concern that needs immediate attention. It is vital for the future prosperity of our nation that we prioritize fiscal responsibility and budget management, even if that requires making tough decisions about spending cuts. Additionally, our national security should remain a top priority, as it directly links to our international standing and overall safety."
I firmly believe that religious freedom is a fundamental right that should be protected and respected. All individuals are entitled to practice their faith without fear of oppression or discrimination. It's also crucial that we maintain the separation of church and state to respect and accommodate diverse beliefs in our society.
"I firmly believe in the power of free market enterprise as a driving force for economic growth and prosperity. Low tax rates and minimal government intervention, I feel, allows for the most significant personal and business growth. I also hold high value in individual responsibility and the pursuit of personal liberties and rights."
"I deeply value the traditional family structure as a cornerstone of our society, believing it provides a vital framework for the moral and social development of individuals. I respect and uphold the innate biological differences between men and women, viewing them as complementary forces that, when combined in the institution of marriage, lead to a balanced and stable environment for raising children."
"The concept of universal healthcare, while noble in its intentions, threatens to undermine the principles of free-market capitalism and individual financial responsibility. It could lead to inefficiencies in healthcare, burdened by bureaucracy and lack of competition. Instead, measures to increase market competition among insurance providers should be pursued to lower costs and improve healthcare quality."
"While I understand the compassion driving the narrative for open borders, I firmly believe that a country should have control over its immigration policies. A strong, well-regulated immigration system is crucial not only for national security but also for sustaining the economic viability of our nation. We should strive for compassion within the bounds of law and order."
"When it comes to immigration, I firmly believe in the importance of a strong and secure border. It's necessary to have a system in place that ensures individuals enter the country legally, as this not only helps maintain order but also upholds national security. However, I also see the value in compassionate policies that recognize and address the struggles faced by refugees and those seeking the American dream."
"In assessing the Iran Nuclear Deal, it becomes evident that while diplomacy should always be preferred to conflict, this agreement falls short of providing sufficient safeguards against Iran's nuclear ambitions. The deal appears to only pause, rather than completely dismantle, Iran's path to a nuclear weapon. Additionally, a more comprehensive deal should also address Iran's destabilizing influence in the Middle East and its support for terrorist organizations."
"The Iran Nuclear Deal, although well-intentioned, leaves too much room for Iran to surreptitiously continue their nuclear program. As a nation dedicated to the stability and peace of the global community, the United States must ensure checks and balances for countries that have shown a propensity towards nuclear weaponry. It is critical to prioritize national security and the safety of our allies above all else."
"It is crucial to recognize the importance of small businesses and entrepreneurship as the engines driving America’s economic growth. Overregulation and heavy taxation stifle their growth and innovation, which in turn slows down our economy significantly. I firmly believe that lessening these burdens will create a more prosperous and dynamic business environment in our country."
"It is crucial to recognize the importance of free market principles and limited government intervention in the economy. This approach encourages competition, spurs innovation, and fosters economic growth. Such conditions allow hardworking individuals to succeed based on their merit, thus promoting a culture of self-reliance and personal responsibility."
"Our nation's foundation was built on the principles of limited government, individual liberties and free-market principles. On the issue of healthcare, I believe that maintaining a competitive, private sector-based system would encourage efficiency and drive innovations. Turning to a single-payer healthcare system would not only risk the quality of our care, but would drastically increase government control and spending."
"I sincerely believe in the importance of religious freedom, as it is one of the foundational cornerstones of our society. The ability for every individual to practice their faith freely and without fear of persecution is a crucial element of a pluralistic and democratic society. It is vital to respect and uphold this right, as it not only fosters a sense of unity and peace, but also allows for the growth of diverse thoughts and ideas."
"The issue of securing our national borders is paramount, as it ensures the safety and sovereignty of our country. It is essential that we sustain a well-regulated immigration system to protect our citizens and maintain order. A nation without enforceable borders is not a nation at all."
"I believe in the importance of tradition, family values, and personal responsibility. These principles serve as the foundation of a prosperous and just society. Furthermore, we need to ensure our economic policies promote individual freedom and enterprise, as it is through these means that our nation has achieved its prosperity and can continue to do so."
"I firmly believe in the importance of maintaining a robust national defense to safeguard our freedoms and way of life. Additionally, I hold a deep conviction that government should play a limited role in our economy, allowing free markets to flourish and innovation to thrive. It's also paramount that constitutional rights, like the right to bear arms, are upheld and protected for all citizens."
"It's crucial to foster an environment that encourages entrepreneurs and rewards hard work, as these are the drivers of a prosperous economy. Overregulation and excessive taxation can stifle business growth and economic innovation. Instead, policies should be geared towards promoting free-market competition, as this naturally regulates prices and promotes quality and innovation."
"I believe in the importance of maintaining our natural resources, but it's also critical to keep our economy robust and thriving. The cost of making extreme environmental regulations can be burdensome for businesses and inhibit growth. Therefore, a balanced approach that respects both our natural environment and economic realities is key."
"I believe in the immense value of our natural resources and the critical need to protect them for future generations. However, it is essential that any environmental regulations we implement should be balanced and considerate of the economy and jobs. Innovation and technological advancement, rather than heavy-handed regulation, can be a promising pathway to achieving environmental sustainability without impeding economic growth."
"I firmly believe in the sanctity and traditional structure of the family unit, viewing it as the backbone of our society. I also value the distinct roles and biological differences between men and women, and believe that these natural characteristics contribute significantly to the healthy functioning of our society."
"The notion of increasing the minimum wage, while seemingly a noble endeavor, may unintentionally hurt the very people it purports to help. Small businesses could experience undue hardship, potentially leading to reduced employment opportunities as they struggle to afford higher wages. Therefore, we should focus on fostering an environment of economic growth and entrepreneurship that will naturally lead to increased wages rather than resorting to government mandates."
"The importance of national sovereignty should never be understated; it serves as the backbone for the preservation of cultural identity, economic stability, and security. Global cooperation is essential, yet it should not impose on the ability of a nation to govern itself independently. Policies like open borders, for example, might sound appealing on a humanitarian level, but they also carry significant implications for national security and economic welfare."
"While the global community should work collaboratively to promote peace and prosperity, it's essential that domestic interests, security, and economic stability remain at the forefront of any foreign policy decisions. The idea of open borders, for example, while noble in its intent, could potentially jeopardize national security and strain resources. It's important to pursue a balanced approach that respects international cooperation but prioritizes the wellbeing of our own citizens."
"It is crucial for the United States to reaffirm its global role as a bastion for free market economies and ensure that countries that blatantly disregard intellectual property rights and manipulate their currencies face appropriate penalties. I also firmly believe in the importance of strong border security and legal immigration systems, in order to maintain national security and uphold the rule of law. Our foreign aid should be judiciously used to support those nations that align with our democratic values and strategic interests."
"I strongly believe in the First Amendment, which supports the right to practice one's religion freely and openly. It's essential to respect and protect religious institutions, and not implement policies that may interfere with their operations or teachings. A truly free society must uphold and protect the diversity and freedom of religious expression."
"I believe in the principles of individual liberty and responsibility. On the issue of healthcare, I am of the opinion that a free-market system is more efficient and effective as it encourages competition and innovation, leading to better quality and affordable healthcare for everyone. Additionally, I think that all citizens should take personal responsibility for their health and wellbeing."
"I believe in the importance of fostering strong, traditional family values, as they form the bedrock of our society. It's crucial to support policies that encourage stability and continuity in families, considering the irreplaceable roles both mothers and fathers play in a child's life. Furthermore, focus should be on recognizing and respecting the biological differences between men and women, as it is the interplay of these differences that enriches the fabric of our society."
"While recognizing the importance of global cooperation, it's crucial that our nation retains its sovereignty and makes decisions that directly benefit our citizens. There's an obligation to prioritize our national interests, economic stability, and security over international pressures and trends. It's imperative to ensure that our participation in international affairs aligns with our values and does not compromise our citizens' well-being or autonomy."
"While discussions about immigration are often passionate and complex, I firmly believe in the fundamental value of having secure borders. Implementing a thorough vetting process is crucial to ensure the safety and economic stability of our nation. At the same time, we must uphold respect for legal tradition and process as a route to citizenship and avoid encouraging unlawful entries."
The importance of fostering a business-friendly environment cannot be understated. Lowering corporate taxes and reducing unnecessary regulations can incentivize entrepreneurial spirit and stimulate job growth. Emphasizing individual responsibility and free-market principles can lead to a more prosperous and self-sufficient society.
"While I strongly believe in the sanctity of life from conception, I also understand the importance of robust discussions in a democratic society. I think it's crucial to remember the essential role of individual freedoms, as long as they do not infringe upon the rights of others. Therefore, I advocate for policies that promote and protect all human life, while respecting individuals' personal convictions."

Unnecessary governmental regulations often hinder innovation and create barriers to entry, stifaling competition. Furthermore, emphasizing personal responsibility and individual liberty can encourage entrepreneurial spirit and foster a strong economy."
"The international community should approach the issue of China's increasing geopolitical influence with caution. China's aggressive expansion in the South China Sea and its implementation of the Belt and Road Initiative reveal its intention to become a dominant power. Such ambitions require other nations to prioritize their own national security and economic interests, while also promoting and upholding democratic values and human rights."
"While I firmly believe in the importance of a clean and healthy environment, it is imperative to prioritize strategies that also maintain economic growth and private sector innovation. Tools such as market-based solutions and technological advancements can play a crucial role in addressing environmental concerns.

"While it's crucial to have safety nets in place for citizens who fall on hard times, it's equally important to not create a culture of dependency. Welfare programs should assist and not discourage individuals from seeking gainful employment. By promoting a robust free market, businesses can grow, create jobs, and ultimately elevate everyone's living standards."
"The government should play a limited role in the economy, allowing free market forces to shape industries and promote competition. High taxes and excessive regulations can stifle business growth and innovation. Additionally, individual rights and personal freedom should be upheld and protected, as they form the bedrock of a just and prosperous society."
"While it's of utmost importance to respect an individual’s freedom to choose and practice their own faith, it's equally crucial to ensure that religious liberties don't infringe upon the rights of others or disrupt societal harmony. The state should strive for a balance between safeguarding religious freedom and maintaining public order. Furthermore, the principle of separation of church and state must be upheld to preserve the impartiality and integrity of our democratic systems."
"I wholeheartedly believe in the importance of individual freedoms and personal responsibility. Regarding healthcare, it's my conviction that a competitive free-market system can drive down costs and provide high-quality care for everyone, rather than broad government intervention. Education-wise, parents should be given the choice and the power over where their child goes to school, enabling a healthy competition among schools, which will lead to better academic outcomes."
"While I firmly believe that our actions should promote the health and sustainability of our environment, it's essential that we approach such concerns with an economic lens as well.

In this ever-globalizing world, cooperation among nations is crucial, but should be framed within the respect of each country's independent policies and decisions. Moreover, I support focusing resources on bolstering our local economy and domestic matters before extending aid overseas."
"Our nation thrives on the principles of equal opportunity and justice for all.

It's important for us to create a system that allows for legal immigration and assimilation, stressing shared values and unity, rather than division."
"While I firmly believe in the importance of economic growth and prosperity, I also recognize the necessity of maintaining the integrity of our natural resources.

"When it comes to the issue of taxation, I firmly believe in the principle of individual responsibility and the power of free markets. High tax rates can stifle enterprise, discourage hard work, and impede economic growth. Therefore, a limited taxation policy, which encourages personal responsibility and free enterprise, should be a significant cornerstone of our economic system."
"I firmly believe in the principle of individual liberty and equality under the law. Consequently, I view any public policy or societal issue through the perspective of its impact on individuals, rather than categorizing them by their race. I have faith that a society where merit, hard work, and individual character take precedence over racial or ethnic background is the most fair and productive."
"I'm a firm believer in the sanctity and importance of the traditional family structure. It is my conviction that this model offers the most stable foundation for the growth, development, and prosperity of our society. I also think that gender roles, though not rigid, have biological and societal significance that should be respected and understood rather than indiscriminately dismissed or redefined."
"I firmly believe in the principle of limited government intervention, especially when it comes to economic matters. Individuals and businesses thrive best when they are allowed to make their own choices, free from heavy taxation and overbearing regulations. Lastly, I believe it is paramount to uphold and protect our national traditions and values as they are the bedrock of our society."
"The free market economy should be respected and relied upon as the primary mechanism to drive the growth and prosperity of our nation.

There's a need to reduce governmental intrusion and allow businesses, large and small, the freedom to operate with minimal interference."
"I believe in the importance of traditional family values as the cornerstone of a healthy and functioning society. The institution of marriage between a man and a woman should not only be respected, but also protected and promoted. In terms of gender, I think it's essential to respect the biological differences and roles that are inherent in our nature, rather than trying to blur or erase them."
"The importance of maintaining a free market economy cannot be overstated, as it fosters competition, encourages innovation, and ultimately leads to the creation of wealth.

"The key to a prosperous society is the potential for individuals to strive towards creating wealth and prosperity without excessive interference from the state. The free market economy, with its inherent entrepreneurial spirit, drives innovation, job creation and economic growth. It is also paramount to maintain fiscal responsibility by keeping taxes low and government spending in check, as this promotes individual responsibility and prevents unsustainable national debt."
"While respecting the diversity of beliefs and the right to freedom of religion, I hold a firm conviction that religious traditions and values play a significant role in the moral and ethical structure of our society. It's crucial for these beliefs to be preserved and respected, while also maintaining a balance with the evolving societal norms. Each religion, in its own unique way, contributes to the cultural richness of our nation and helps to foster unity and mutual understanding among its people."
"While it's essential to acknowledge and respect the struggles faced by various racial groups in our nation, I believe it's equally important to focus on creating a unified society that fosters equal opportunity, rather than promoting policies that may inadvertently cause division or favoritism.

The importance of facilitating equal opportunities for everyone, regardless of their race, while also maintaining societal order and security, is paramount in my view."
"I firmly believe in the principles of free-market capitalism, which encourages competition and innovation while promoting individual freedom and responsibility.

"I believe that national sovereignty is paramount and every country should be able to govern itself freely without interference from external forces. Maintaining strong borders is crucial for national security, as it aids in controlling illegal immigration and potential threats. Furthermore, international trade agreements should be negotiated in a way that benefits our local industries and economy."
The Iran Nuclear Deal seems to be a misguided attempt at preserving peace through appeasement. It's clear that it does not have the robust verification and enforcement measures needed to ensure Iran's compliance. Providing economic relief to a regime that supports international terrorism and suppresses the basic rights of its own people seems to be a dangerous and short-sighted strategy.
"National defense should unquestionably be a top priority for our government.

However, we must also ensure fair trade practices that protect the interests of our own citizens and industries."
"I believe in the importance of preserving traditional family values, as they often act as the bedrock of our society.

Regulations can often stifle the growth and competitiveness of industries, and can potentially lead to job loss. I stand for a balanced approach that ensures both economic prosperity and environmental sustainability."
"In regards to the freedom of religious expression, I firmly believe in the importance of preserving and respecting this fundamental human right.

This doesn't negate the importance of providing pathways for legal immigration, but ensuring order and adherence to our laws is paramount."
"The current approach towards China must be re-evaluated, given the significant economic, technological, and military strides they have taken in the past decades.

"While acknowledging the historical and current struggles of racial minorities in the United States, it's important to advocate for equality of opportunity, rather than forcefully mandating equal outcomes.

A balance of empathy and respect for the law is crucial for the harmony and prosperity of our nation."
"I firmly believe that our nation was built upon the foundations of religious freedom, and it's crucial that we continue to uphold this right for all our citizens.

Parents should have the autonomy to decide the best educational environment for their children, whether that be public, private, or homeschooling. It's also essential to ensure that our curricula promote not only academic proficiency but also a comprehensive understanding of our nation's history and values, in order to foster informed and responsible citizens."
"The Iran Nuclear Deal, as it currently stands, seems misguided as it provides only temporary restrictions on Iran's nuclear capabilities and releases billions of dollars to a state known for sponsoring terrorism. Strengthening the terms and inspection measures of this deal would fortify our national security and global peace. It's vital that we continue to support our allies in the region and maintain a robust presence to deter potential threats."

"While it is undeniable that our environment needs protection, I believe we must find a balance between sustainability and economic growth. We should encourage the responsible use and management of our natural resources, as opposed to outright banning industries that contribute to pollution.

"Respecting traditional family values and structures is essential to the moral fabric of our society.

"The importance of national sovereignty cannot be overstated, as the capacity to self-govern allows a nation to uphold its unique customs, values, and way of life. On the issue of international immigration, while it's essential to show compassion and respect for human rights, it is equally crucial to uphold the rule of law and maintain stringent border controls to ensure national security.

"It is crucial to foster an education system that values tradition, personal responsibility, and autonomy.

Education should be localized, giving parents and communities the primary role in shaping their children's futures, rather than a centralized government."
"I believe in the fundamental right to practice religious beliefs freely and without interference, as long as such practices do not infringe upon the rights of others. It is also crucial to maintain the separation of church and state, to ensure that no single belief system influences the governing of our diverse society.

"I firmly believe in the principle of self-reliance and personal responsibility, which extends to my stance on social welfare programs. While I acknowledge that safety nets are necessary for those in genuine need, I'm concerned that over-reliance on government aid can stifle individual initiative. Also, I reckon that it is essential to uphold the sanctity of the constitution and protect the rights and freedoms it provides, especially in regards to gun ownership and religious freedom."
"I firmly hold that healthcare decisions should primarily be between a patient and their doctor, not dictated by government officials who may not have the individual's best interests at heart. I believe in fostering personal responsibility and accountability, and in providing a robust business environment which can naturally lead to more affordable and accessible healthcare for all. Additionally, I advocate for a more decentralized approach in our education system, empowering local communities and parents to have a significant role in shaping the curriculums that align with their values and the unique needs of their children."
"The surge in government spending, particularly in developed nations, is worrisome. The lack of fiscal discipline not only threatens economic stability but also poses a threat to the future generations who will be burdened with unsustainable debts. It is essential to push for responsible fiscal policies to safeguard our economic future."
"Our nation's security should always be a top priority. Regarding the Iran Nuclear Deal, it seems imprudent to provide financial relief and ease sanctions on a country that has consistently shown hostility towards us and our allies. We should uphold stronger policies that ensure our safety and maintain our position as a global leader, not facilitate potentially dangerous nations."
"I firmly believe in the importance of traditional family values as the backbone of a stable society. These values, I feel, promote personal responsibility, respect, and a sense of community. Additionally, with regards to welfare, I support measures that encourage self-reliance and individual initiative, rather than fostering dependency on government assistance."
"While I respect the diversity of our nation, I firmly believe that the sanctity of marriage should be preserved as a union between a man and a woman. Any alterations to this traditional structure could potentially undermine the stability of our society. However, I also believe in the importance of treating all individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of their personal choices."
"While it's critical to ensure equal opportunities for all, it's equally important to uphold the principles of merit and individual responsibilities. The government should provide a fair playing field, but it should not be overly involved in dictating outcomes. This approach respects the dignity and agency of each individual and encourages personal growth."
"When it comes to tackling issues centered around race, I believe in focusing on the values of individualism and equality of opportunity. It's important to remember that every citizen, regardless of their race or ethnicity, deserves an equal shot at success. Instead of promoting policies based on race, we should encourage initiatives that uplift everyone, ensuring that the societal structures are fair, just, and blind to color."
"While I firmly believe in the importance of preserving our environment, it is essential to balance this with the need for economic growth and jobs. It's crucial to capitalize on clean energy solutions that are economically viable and will provide employment opportunities. However, we should also make sure our regulatory decisions don't stifle innovation or hinder the prosperity of the hardworking American citizens."
"Government intervention in the free market should be minimal. The forces of supply and demand, if left unhindered, naturally lead to economic efficiency and growth. High taxation and excessive regulations tend to stifle innovation and enterprise."
"I believe in the traditional family structure as a backbone of society, which has been proven over time to provide stability and well-being for children. Furthermore, I believe that the concept of gender should be biologically determined, valuing the unique roles and contributions made by both men and women in our society. It's important to approach these issues with respect for individual freedom, yet also with a recognition of the shared values that have long anchored our communities."
"The current situation with China and the trade imbalance is a matter of deep concern. It's important to establish policies that prioritize our domestic industries and protect intellectual property rights. Our international engagements should reflect our national interests, maintaining a strong defense and a flourishing economy."
"While I believe that environmental conservation is undeniably important, I hold strongly that it is private sector innovation, not greater government regulation, that will ultimately solve our environmental challenges. We must foster an environment where our businesses can freely innovate and adapt to cleaner and more efficient technologies. Moreover, it's essential that we use our natural resources in a responsible and sustainable manner, rather than restricting access altogether."
"I firmly believe in the principle of personal responsibility when it comes to health matters. For instance, while I see the merit in public health initiatives, I think it's paramount that individuals take proactive steps towards maintaining their own health, which includes making informed decisions about vaccinations and lifestyle choices. Our nation could greatly benefit from an educational system that encourages critical thinking and personal accountability, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach."
"While I appreciate and understand the need for sustainable solutions to protect our environment, I believe it's essential to approach environmental policy in a way that does not stifle economic growth or jeopardize American jobs. Furthermore, I am a strong advocate for fostering innovation and market-based solutions to address environmental challenges, rather than heavy-handed government regulations. It's essential that we strike a balance between environmental stewardship and economic prosperity."
"While it's undeniable that mindful stewardship of our natural resources is crucial for future generations, it's equally important to strike a balance with economic interests. Over-regulation can impede growth and innovation, which are key to our nation's prosperity. We must search for efficient, market-based solutions to environmental challenges that encourage both environmental sustainability and economic development."
"While I firmly believe in safeguarding our environment, I also maintain that it should not be pursued at the expense of our economy. I support environmentally friendly initiatives but stress the importance of a balanced approach that does not hinder job creation or economic progress. It's absolutely crucial that we find ways to harmonize economic growth with environmental protection, ensuring sustainable development."
"I firmly believe in the sanctity of life, considering it to be the most fundamental right. This perspective extends to the unborn, whom I believe require protection. Additionally, I am an advocate for limited government intervention, valuing the rights and freedoms of individuals to make decisions that best suit their circumstances and beliefs."
"Our country was founded on the principle of religious liberty, a tenet that empowers individuals with the freedom to express their faith without fear of retribution. It is therefore integral that this right be upheld and respected, regardless of individual beliefs or practices. Every person should be able to live out their faith in the public square, so long as it doesn't infringe upon the rights and freedoms of others."
"While it is undeniable that we need to address our environmental challenges, it is crucial to balance those efforts with the economic realities faced by many Americans. Rather than embracing radical climate proposals that could potentially cripple our industries and cost jobs, we should invest in technological innovation that promotes cleaner and more efficient production methods. It's important to ensure that environmental policies are not just beneficial for the planet, but also for the nation's economic stability and job growth."
"I believe in the strength of individual responsibility, family values, and the importance of a robust economy, and I see these as critical factors in addressing social issues. It's crucial that we foster a society in which everyone has the opportunity to succeed through hard work and determination. Government intervention should be limited, allowing for a free market system where economic growth can thrive and create opportunities for all."
"While I firmly believe in the principle of equal opportunity for all, it's vital that we maintain the integrity of our laws and systems. Our immigration process should be fair and legal, ensuring the best for both our country and those seeking to become a part of it. Concerning racial justice, I endorse the idea of unity and mutual respect, but I have reservations about policies that may inadvertently foster division rather than remedying it."
"While I respect the importance of the separation of church and state, I firmly believe that religious freedom should not be compromised. Religious values and beliefs form a fundamental part of our individual and national identity, and they should be given due recognition in our society. Therefore, any policy that infringes on the freedom to practice one's faith or express religious beliefs should be approached with caution and thorough deliberation."
"I firmly believe in the concept of limited government and individual liberty, especially when it comes to economic policies. In the context of healthcare reform, for instance, I am an advocate for market-based solutions and competition, as opposed to government-controlled systems. I also strongly value the principles of personal responsibility and self-reliance, which I believe are progressively getting eroded in present discourse."
"I believe that focusing on stimulating economic growth and creating jobs should be centrally important. Lower taxes and reducing regulatory barriers can encourage businesses to thrive, fostering innovation and competition. Additionally, individuals should have the freedom and opportunity to pursue their own economic endeavors."
"While I firmly believe that we have a responsibility to be good stewards of our planet, it's crucial to strike a balance between environmental protection and economic growth. Over-regulation can stifle industry and innovation, potentially harming livelihoods. A free market, guided by responsible consumers, can often provide the most effective environmental protection."
"When it comes to the topic of welfare programs, I believe that they should exist to provide temporary support to those genuinely in need, but not to encourage dependence. It's critical to promote self-reliance, hard work, and personal responsibility as core values, which can ultimately lead to a more stable and prosperous society. Furthermore, the economy thrives best when the private sector is robust and government interference is minimal."
"The Iran Nuclear Deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, is a flawed agreement that does not adequately ensure the prevention of Iran obtaining nuclear weapons. Providing sanctions relief without securing watertight guarantees of nuclear disarmament jeopardizes the security interests of the United States and our allies. We need a more robust strategy that holds Iran accountable, not one that offers economic rewards in return for vague promises."
"I believe in the inherent value and unique worth of every individual, irrespective of their race or ethnicity. It's important to acknowledge that everyone should have equal opportunities to succeed and thrive in society. However, I am skeptical of government-mandated programs that attempt to engineer outcomes based on race, as they could inadvertently lead to further division and resentment."
"In my perspective, it's crucial that we balance environmental stewardship with economic growth. I believe in the potential of ingenuity and innovation to address environmental concerns, rather than heavy-handed regulatory approaches. We must encourage businesses to adopt sustainable practices without hindering their competitiveness and growth."
"While I believe every individual should have the freedom to make their own choices, I also firmly uphold the importance of traditional family values as the foundation of our society. It is crucial to instill these principles in future generations for a well-rounded development. Furthermore, it's essential to maintain fiscal responsibility and promote self-reliance instead of over-dependence on government assistance."
"I believe that the traditional family structure, with a father and a mother, plays a fundamental role in the upbringing and development of children. Respect for the distinct roles of each gender within a family unit contributes to a balanced society. Upholding these values does not mean we ignore the diversity of family structures, but rather, we recognize their unique contributions."
"On the matter of religious freedom, it is paramount to uphold the principles that our founding fathers established. Every individual should have the liberty to practice their faith without undue interference or prejudice, as enshrined in our constitution. This includes the protection of faith-based groups to operate in accordance with their religious beliefs, even when these beliefs might not align with broader societal trends."
"I firmly believe in the principle of religious freedom, as it's one of the foundational pillars upon which our nation was built. I feel it's crucial to protect the rights of individuals to practice their religion without government interference, as long as it doesn't infringe upon the rights of others. Any law or policy should respect and uphold this fundamental American value."
"I believe that the foundation of a strong society lies in the institution of the traditional family, with the two-parent model offering the best support system for the growth and development of children. I also value the distinct attributes and roles that men and women each bring to family life and society at large, suggesting that these differences are not just biological, but also contribute to the diverse social fabric that we inhabit. It's important to foster and appreciate these differences, rather than trying to erase or homogenize them."
"While it's undeniably crucial to foster and protect our environment for future generations, we must also take into account the economic implications of environmental policies. Overly restrictive regulations can often hinder economic growth and job creation. Therefore, it's essential to strike a balance between preserving our natural resources and maintaining a thriving economy."
"I firmly believe that our country should maintain secure borders to ensure the safety and economic prosperity of its citizens, with a clearly defined and fair process for those who wish to become a part of the American dream. However, I also see the value in reviewing and reforming policies that may disproportionately affect certain racial or ethnic groups. It’s crucial that we strike a balance between preserving national security and promoting equal opportunity for all."
"While I firmly believe in the cultural diversity that immigration brings, I also believe it's paramount to uphold the integrity of our nation's borders. A well-regulated, lawful immigration process not only respects our laws but also ensures the security and economic stability of our country. As for racial justice, it's essential to recognize individual merit and hard work rather than focusing on race or ethnicity, while also striving to weed out any systemic bias that might exist."
"While I firmly support the notion of environmental preservation, I believe in doing so through market-based solutions and innovation, not heavy-handed regulation. The potential impact on our economy, jobs, and personal freedoms should never be downplayed in the pursuit of greener policies. Therefore, I advocate for sustainable growth that incorporates both our environmental responsibilities and our economic needs."
"I firmly believe in upholding the traditional family values that have been the foundation of our society for centuries. Furthermore, I assert that the responsibility for a child's educational path rests primarily with the parents, not the state. Our medical decisions, too, should be personal choices, guided by the advice of trusted physicians, rather than mandates enforced by the government."
"While it is necessary to acknowledge humanity's role in environmental changes, it's important to engage in practical solutions that don't undermine economic growth and individual freedoms. This can include investing in technological advancements that promote cleaner energy and reevaluating regulations to ensure they aren't stifling innovation. Sustainable practices need to be economically viable to ensure long-term adoption and success."

Both of these aspects are crucial for maintaining a balanced and harmonious society."
"I believe in the principle of personal responsibility and limited government interference in our lives. I think it's important to maintain traditional family values that have been the backbone of our society for generations. On the issue of government-funded social programs, I believe they should serve as a safety net rather than a way of life, encouraging self-sufficiency and individual initiative."
"I firmly believe in the principle of limited government intervention in the economy and in citizens' personal lives. On the issue of healthcare, for instance, I am convinced that the free market, rather than a government-run system, is the most effective and efficient provider of high-quality, affordable healthcare. The private sector, driven by competition and consumer choice, incentivizes innovation and cost reduction, ultimately benefiting the consumer and the nation as a whole."

Excessive government intervention in industries often stifers progress and creates inefficiencies. It's crucial to maintain minimal regulations and low taxes, allowing the businesses to thrive and creating job opportunities."
"I strongly believe that traditional family values form the bedrock of a stable society. The institution of marriage, ideally between a man and a woman, should be cherished and protected as it has been throughout history. Moreover, each gender has unique and complementary strengths that, when combined, contribute to a balanced and thriving environment for raising children."
"I believe that the traditional family structure plays a pivotal role in society, providing the foundation for a stable, prosperous community. This institution has withstood the test of time and proven essential in facilitating moral development, encouraging personal accountability, and fostering healthy, productive individuals. Thus, it's crucial to uphold and protect these values for the betterment of our society."
"The inherent beauty of America lies in its rich tapestry of diversity, brought about by centuries of immigration. It's crucial however, to ensure national security and economic stability, that our immigration policies are robust, orderly, and lawful. While I wholeheartedly believe in equal opportunities for all, I am also convinced that any form of preferential treatment or selectivity based on race can only serve to undermine the fundamental American principle of meritocracy."
"The United States should approach international relations with a strong, assertive stance, prioritizing national interests and the protection of American citizens. We must ensure that our trade agreements are fair and not disproportionately beneficial to other nations at our expense. Additionally, supporting our allies is crucial, but not at the cost of compromising our country's security or economy."
"I firmly believe that our healthcare system, while it requires improvements, should not shift towards a universal, government-run model. It is essential to prioritize individual choice and market competition to drive quality and efficiency, as this can lead to advancements and innovations in patient care. Putting the government in control of healthcare can limit these opportunities and potentially lead to a decline in the quality of care."
"The efficiency and prosperity that free market capitalism brings should not be undermined by excessive government regulation.

A self-sustained economy, driven by individual liberty and private property rights, will always outperform a system constrained by governmental intervention."
"I firmly believe in the power of a free-market economy, where competition fosters innovation, efficiency, and growth. Over-regulation can suffocate businesses, impede entrepreneurship, and ultimately slow economic growth. It's critical to create an environment that encourages investment, rewards hard work and allows businesses, large and small, to thrive."
"I firmly believe in the principles of limited government, fiscal responsibility, and individual liberty.

I believe that the right to choose our own healthcare provider is a personal freedom that should be safeguarded."
"I firmly believe that the traditional family structure has been a cornerstone of stability and prosperity in our society. The preservation of these family values, such as respect for marriage and the roles of each family member, is vital. Furthermore, I believe that acknowledging the inherent biological differences between genders is essential to a functioning society, rather than attempting to blur or erase these distinctions."
"Ensuring a robust economy is paramount for the prosperity of our nation. It's essential to maintain a business-friendly environment with low taxes, limited regulations, and a free-market approach to stimulate competition and innovation. We must also enforce fiscal responsibility and minimize government intervention in order to preserve individual freedom and self-reliance."
"While I believe in the importance of safeguarding our environment, this must be balanced against the need to protect jobs and economic growth. Overly stringent regulations can cripple industries, causing harm to communities dependent on them. It's essential that we explore market-driven approaches and promote responsible industrial practices which ensure both the prosperity of our economy and the health of our environment."
"I firmly believe in the power of free markets and individual entrepreneurship to spur economic growth. Heavy regulation or government intervention tends to stifle this innovation and should be minimized to allow businesses to flourish. Lower taxes and less governmental interference, I believe, are key to fostering a strong economy."

Over-regulation and excessive governmental intervention often stifle innovation and business growth. A robust economy is best achieved when businesses and individuals are empowered to create and contribute without undue restrictions.
"The issue of healthcare demands attention, especially regarding the Affordable Care Act. It is essential to ensure that every citizen has access to quality health services, but the current system, with its government overreach and inefficiencies, is not the most effective way to achieve this. I firmly believe that market competition and patient choice are key to raising healthcare standards and reducing costs."
"I believe in the principles of free market capitalism where businesses and individuals have the ability to compete freely, leading to innovation, efficiency, and wealth creation. Government intervention should be minimized as it often leads to inefficiency and restricts competition. Such an environment fosters self-reliance and personal responsibility, which are keys to economic prosperity."
"I firmly believe in our constitutional right to freedom of religion, which serves as the cornerstone of American democracy. It is essential to respect and protect everyone's right to practice their faith without interference from the government. However, it is equally important that these religious practices never infrive upon the personal liberties and rights of others, underscoring the need for a balanced approach to religious freedom."
"I believe that every individual, regardless of their racial or ethnic background, should be given the same opportunities and rights. It's crucial to uphold the principle of individual responsibility and merit-based success. Equality should mean equal opportunity, not equal outcome, and we should strive for a society where everyone has the freedom to rise and succeed based on their abilities and efforts."
"As a strong proponent of free-market capitalism, I believe that it's the most effective system for fostering innovation, growth, and prosperity. Government intervention should be limited in economic affairs, as it often leads to inefficiencies and stifles competition. The individual's right to economic freedom and the pursuit of prosperity is paramount to a robust and thriving economy."
"It is critically important for the United States to maintain its position as a global leader, ensuring the integrity and security of democratic values abroad. As such, we must take a firm stance against nations that undermine international peace and human rights, using our economic and military strength to enforce these standards. The growth of autocratic regimes is a direct threat to our national security and interests, and it's our responsibility to confront these challenges, not retreat from them."
"While it is undeniable that environmental preservation is vital for our future, it's important to strike a balance between conservation and economic growth. Policies regarding environmental protection should be implemented in a way that doesn't hamper industrial and economic progress. Innovation, not regulation, should be the key in addressing environmental concerns."
"While I respect the principles of religious freedom and individual liberty, I strongly believe that the sanctity of life should be protected from conception. It is important to balance the rights provided by the constitution with moral and ethical considerations that often originate from religious beliefs. Our society should encourage values that promote life, responsibility, and dignity for everyone."
"While recognizing the diverse cultures and talents immigrants bring to our nation, it is essential to uphold the rule of law and protect national security. This necessitates a clear, strong, and effective immigration policy that promotes legal immigration and prioritizes the interests of existing citizens. Additionally, regarding racial justice, it's vital to ensure equal opportunities and liberties for all, rather than favouring specific racial or ethnic groups, as the Constitution guarantees these rights to every individual, regardless of race."
"While I believe in the importance of preserving our environment for future generations, I also think it's crucial that we maintain a balance with economic progress. Over-regulation can stifle growth and innovation. In my view, the best approach is to encourage responsible business practices through market-based incentives, rather than imposing harsh penalties."
"Concerning the issue of healthcare, I firmly believe in the efficacy and efficiency of free-market systems. Health services, like other goods and services, should be subjected to competition, which naturally drives down prices and improves quality. Increased government intervention may lead to inefficiencies and potentially stifle medical innovation by limiting competition."
"I firmly believe in the importance of religious liberty, as it forms the foundational pillar of our democratic society. Everyone should have the right to practice their faith freely without fear of persecution. Maintaining the balance of this freedom, while ensuring it doesn't infrive upon the rights of others, is critically essential for social harmony and respect for individual's beliefs."
"The concept of raising corporate tax rates to fund extensive government programs is fundamentally misguided. True economic prosperity stems from incentivizing businesses to grow, innovate, and create jobs through a competitive tax structure. A robust, free-market economy offers the best path towards individual prosperity and national wealth, not an overextended government budget fueled by higher taxes."
"In regards to religious freedom, I strongly uphold the principle that every individual has the right to practice their faith freely, without governmental intrusion.

I strongly believe in the power of free markets and limited government intervention in the economy. I see entrepreneurship and private sector growth as key drivers of prosperity. Lower taxes and deregulation can stimulate economic growth by encouraging investment and innovation.
"The Paris Climate Agreement, while well-intentioned in its effort to combat global warming, places an undue economic burden on the United States. It disincentivizes domestic industries and job growth while allowing other major polluters, like China and India, to continue their emissions unchecked. A better strategy would be to invest more in technological innovation and free-market solutions rather than constraining our economy with overzealous regulations."
"While it's important to protect and preserve our environment, we must also recognize the need to balance environmental policy with economic growth and job creation. Overregulation can impede progress and stifle innovative solutions. A free-market approach, fostering competition and encouraging technological advancements, will be more beneficial for both our economy and the environment."
"While I believe it's essential to protect our environment, I think it's vital to balance this with economic growth. Sustainable practices should be encouraged, but not at the expense of crippling our industries or placing an undue burden on the less affluent. The best path forward is through innovative technologies and market-driven solutions, rather than extensive governmental regulation."
"I firmly believe that it is through reduced taxation and minimized government intervention that we will truly experience economic growth and prosperity. The role of a thriving private sector is paramount in creating jobs, spurring innovation, and providing opportunities for individuals to improve their economic stations. In essence, it is economic freedom that shapes a vibrant and prosperous nation."
"The current situation in the Middle East underscores the necessity for a robust and strategic foreign policy. We must prioritize national security and support our allies in the region, especially Israel, a beacon of democracy amidst autocratic regimes. However, we should also encourage self-reliance among these nations to foster stability and reduce their dependency on American military intervention."
"When it comes to the issue of family structure, I firmly believe that the traditional two-parent household offers a strong foundation for raising children. It is in the best interest of our society to uphold and encourage this model, as it has been proven to provide a balanced environment for children's development. It is also vital to recognize the unique and complementary roles both genders play in the upbringing of children."
"I believe that the key to economic growth lies in free market principles, and less government intervention. High taxes and regulations do more harm than good by stifering businesses and reducing competition. Personal responsibility and individual liberty should be the core principles that guide our nation's policies and laws."
"Addressing the issue of international trade, I believe that it is crucial for these agreements to prioritize the protection of American workers and industries. For instance, it's vital that we scrutinize the implications of deals like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, ensuring they favor our nation's interests. Our policies should always stress the importance of fair trade over free trade."
"I truly believe in the fundamental right of religious liberty as it is enshrined in our Constitution. I also consider it crucial to preserve the Judeo-Christian values that have shaped our nation's heritage, which does not imply imposing them on others, but rather, allowing them to flourish without hindrance. It is important that we always seek a balanced approach to ensure that the freedom of one group doesn't infringe upon the rights and liberties of another."
"I believe in the importance of recognizing and promoting individuality rather than categorizing people based on their race. Society is best served when we focus on the content of a person's character rather than the color of their skin. Equal opportunities for all, irrespective of their racial background, is fundamental to a harmonious and prosperous nation."
"I believe that every individual, irrespective of their race or nationality, has a fundamental right to equality and justice. However, I also maintain that immigration policies should be designed to safeguard national security and prioritize legal procedures. Upholding law and order, supporting a fair legal immigration system, and respecting individual rights should always be emphasized to ensure the prosperity and safety of our nation."
"The idea of increasing the federal minimum wage sounds appealing on paper, but when we delve deeper, it risks hurting the businesses, particularly the small ones, that form the backbone of our economy. It could lead to increased unemployment as businesses may not be able to afford such a drastic increase in labor costs. Thus, emphasizing skill development and promoting a robust job market should be our priority over artificially raising wages."
"On the issue of religious freedom, I firmly believe that every individual should be allowed to practice their faith without intrusion or limitation, as guaranteed by the First Amendment. However, this liberty should not be misused to infringe upon the rights of others or to justify actions that contradict the shared values and laws that maintain societal harmony. It's a balancing act of respecting personal beliefs while ensuring the greater good for all."
"While I wholeheartedly agree that preserving our environment is crucial, I am also cognizant of the economic implications of stringent environmental regulations.

"It's paramount that we uphold the free market system as it is the driving force behind our economic prosperity. Over-regulation and heavy taxation can hinder businesses, large and small, and stifle job creation. We should encourage entrepreneurial spirit, not suppress it with unfriendly policies."
"In the debate over minimum wage, it's crucial to consider the potential ramifications on small businesses. High increases might result in layoffs or fewer hiring opportunities, potentially hurting those it aims to help. To ensure economic growth and job stability, policies should encourage business expansion and job creation, rather than imposing burdensome costs."
"While it is paramount to protect our environment, it is equally important to strike a balance between conservation and economic growth. We must find a sustainable solution that promotes clean energy innovation, without hindering job opportunities or creating an undue fiscal burden on businesses and citizens. Harnessing market forces can reward environmental stewardship and drive sustainable practices."
"Regarding the Iran Nuclear Deal, it's vital that we address the fact that Iran has continually proven untrustworthy in honoring its international commitments.

"I believe in the inherent dignity and worth of all individuals, regardless of their racial or ethnic background. Our focus should be on promoting equal opportunity for all, rather than driving division through race-focused policies. It's important to find common ground and work towards unity, while acknowledging and respecting our diverse backgrounds."
"I believe that the structure of a traditional family, with a mother and a father, is fundamental to the growth and development of children. It provides them a balanced environment where they learn different values from each parent. Furthermore, I hold the view that gender is not a social construct, but is biologically determined, and that society should respect and uphold these natural differences."
"I believe in fostering economic growth through free-market capitalism, which allows individuals to navigate their own financial paths. Lower taxes for all, including corporations, can stimulate investment, job creation, and overall economic prosperity. It is my firm conviction that unnecessary regulations often stifle innovation and should therefore be minimized to allow businesses to thrive."
"While I deeply respect the principles of compassion and assistance to those in need, I fundamentally believe in the importance of personal responsibility and the power of free markets. I'm concerned that excessive government intrusion into the economy can stifle innovation, limit personal freedom, and ultimately undermine prosperity. It's crucial to find a balance, ensuring a safety net for those who need it, while preserving the incentives and opportunities that drive our success."
"I firmly believe that the American healthcare system, while in need of some reforms, maintains its global standing due to its innovative research and treatments that save lives every day. The introduction of a universal healthcare system, as proposed by some, could stagnate this innovation and possibly lead to longer wait times for critical procedures. It’s essential to prioritize a patient's freedom to choose their medical services and maintain a competitive marketplace to drive healthcare advances."
"I believe in the power of free market capitalism to drive economic growth and prosperity. Limiting government intervention and promoting competition are critical for fostering innovation and efficiency. Additionally, I hold that individual fiscal responsibility and self-reliance are key to creating a robust and stable economy."
"On the topic of religious freedom, I firmly believe in the fundamental American tenet that every individual has the right to practice their faith freely, without government interference. It's necessary to ensure that no religious group is given preferential treatment over another, while also respecting the rights of those who choose not to follow a faith. Protecting the sanctity of this freedom remains a priority."
"Our nation has always thrived as a melting pot of cultures, ideas, and innovations from across the globe, and it is this diversity that makes us strong.

It's important for us to have conversations anchored in respect, understanding, and factual accuracy."
"While understanding the need for providing healthcare to all, I firmly believe that a market-driven approach is more effective in delivering quality and affordable care. Over-extended government intervention could stifle competition, innovation, and patient choice. Similarly, on the education front, advocating for school choice allows parents the flexibility to choose a suitable education system for their children, fostering competition among schools and improving education standards."

I also hold a strong conviction that upholding individual liberties and personal responsibility is paramount to keeping our nation thriving. On issues of national security, it's crucial to prioritize the safety and interests of our citizens above all else."
"I believe in the sanctity and importance of religious freedom, viewing it as a cornerstone upon which our society is built. It is vital to respect and tolerate the diversity of faiths, recognizing that these differences enrich our community rather than divide it. Moreover, I consider it essential to protect religious institutions from state interference, thus ensuring the robust practice of faith in line with our constitutional principles."
"I believe in the importance of religious freedom and the right to express one's faith without fear of persecution. It is essential to respect the diverse range of beliefs and practices that exist within our society, as they contribute greatly to our cultural richness and mutual understanding. Furthermore, the principles of morality and ethics, often derived from religious teachings, play a crucial role in shaping a compassionate and fair society."
"I believe that every individual, regardless of their racial background, deserves equal opportunities to succeed and thrive in our society. The focus should be on promoting individual merit and hard work, rather than implementing racial preference-based policies. Our goal should be a society where race is not a factor in determining success."
"While I firmly believe in the importance of conserving our natural resources for future generations, I also understand the crucial role that industry and development play in our economy. Therefore, it is essential to strike a balance between economic growth and environmental protection. Technological advancements should be leveraged to minimize environmental harm without hindering our nation's productive capacity."
"As a strong believer in religious freedom, I uphold that every individual should have the right to practice their faith without government interference. It's crucial to maintain the separation of church and state, as outlined in our constitution, to protect both our religious institutions and our government. This separation ensures that every American can practice their religion freely and that our government remains neutral, respecting every citizen's rights to their beliefs."
"I firmly believe in an immigration policy that is strict, yet fair, one that prioritizes law and order but also understands the American dream. Everyone should be given the opportunity to earn their place in this great country if they are willing to do so legally and contribute positively to our society. Regarding racial justice, I am of the view that all citizens, regardless of their race, should be treated equally under the law, promoting unity and discouraging division."
"While it's undeniable that we need to take care of our planet, it is also important to consider the economic implications of drastic actions like banning fracking altogether. This industry is crucial to supporting our economy and providing thousands of jobs. Therefore, we should focus on finding ways to make these industries more environmentally friendly, rather than eradicating them completely."
"I firmly believe in the importance of maintaining standards of excellence and competition in our education system. A school choice policy, which empowers parents to select the best education settings for their children, seems to be the most effective way to stimulate improvement. Moreover, I advocate for personal responsibility and reduced government intervention in healthcare, as I feel that free-market competition is capable of driving quality up and costs down."
"I strongly believe in the importance of individual freedom and personal responsibility. I hold that a smaller government, with limited intervention, fosters the growth of a strong economy. In addition, I value the preservation and protection of traditional social values."
"I firmly believe in the principles of free market capitalism as the most effective economic system. It promotes competition, fosters innovation, and offers individuals the freedom to determine their financial destiny. Over-regulation and excess government intervention, on the other hand, can impede growth and create unnecessary burdens for businesses and individuals alike."
"It's crucial to respect the sanctity of life, a belief rooted deeply in my moral and ethical convictions. I firmly believe in the protection of religious liberties, ensuring that all Americans can live out their faith without fear of infringement. These guiding principles affirm the values this great nation was founded upon and should be upheld in all policy considerations."

Our society should be committed to fostering an environment where character and capabilities are valued above the color of one's skin. The essence of human dignity and respect transcends race and hence, policies should be made on this principle."
"National security should always be a top priority when it comes to our foreign policy decisions. The threat of radical extremism and other global conflicts unarguably affects our own safety, economy, and way of life. It is paramount to ensure we maintain strong ties with our allies, while also enforcing regulations and sanctions on nations that pose a threat to global peace and stability."
"As we engage in conversations about traditional family structures, it's critical to remember the profound influence such environments have on the upbringing and development of children. In regards to gender-focused matters, I believe in the importance of respecting biological distinctions, while also upholding that individual rights should not be compromised. Nonetheless, public policy should respect and bolster the stability of societal bedrock institutions like the nuclear family, which have historically fostered prosperity and wellbeing."
"While it’s crucial to maintain the foundational principle of religious freedom, it's equally important to ensure that this freedom does not encroach upon the rights and freedoms of others. The government should never infringe on an individual's right to practice their faith, but neither should it allow religious doctrines to dictate legislation. Respecting diversity of beliefs while upholding the rule of law is key to maintaining a free and just society."
"The sanctity of religious freedom is something that must be upheld and protected in every corner of this great nation. Our founding fathers intended for us to live in a society wherein individuals can practice their faith freely, without interference or suppression from the government. It is crucial that we continue to honor this fundamental right and safeguard the diverse tapestry of faiths that makes us uniquely American."
"On the matter of healthcare, I firmly believe in individual choice and personal responsibility. It's crucial that we maintain a system that awards hard work and innovation, rather than one that may stifle these values through extensive governmental control. This is why I advocate for market-based solutions, which allow competition to drive quality up and prices down."
"I firmly believe in the importance of maintaining the right to freely practice one's religion without interference or judgement. It's crucial to uphold this foundational principle our country was built upon, as it promotes a diverse, tolerant and cohesive society. At the same time, I also uphold the significance of preserving the traditional values and morals that are often rooted in religious beliefs, as they provide a moral compass for society."
"While we have a responsibility to protect and promote human rights across the globe, we cannot intervene militarily in every conflict without risking our own national security. American interests should guide our foreign policy decisions, and we should focus on building strong alliances and economically prosperous relationships. Moreover, diplomacy and economic pressure, not military force, should be the primary tools to encourage countries to respect individual liberties and the rule of law."
"I believe in the sanctity of life at all stages, insisting that every person, from conception to natural death, has an inherent dignity and a right to life.

I also see the importance of maintaining traditional family values as the bedrock of our society, upholding the crucial roles that both mothers and fathers play in the upbringing of children."
"I believe that the strength of our society lies in the traditional family structure, which serves as a solid foundation for nurturing responsible citizens. It's essential to uphold and respect parental rights as they have the primary responsibility for their children's upbringing and education. Additionally, while recognizing the inherent dignity of all individuals, I support the biological definition of gender, affirming it as an important aspect of our individual and collective identity."
"I firmly believe in the principle of religious liberty, which grants all individuals the freedom to follow their faith, or lack thereof, without governmental interference. It's essential to respect and protect the diversity of religious beliefs in our society, just as it is equally important that these beliefs should not infrict upon the rights and freedoms of others. A balance must be struck to ensure the coexistence of different faiths and philosophies within our shared public spaces."
"I firmly believe in the principle of individual liberty and the importance of free markets. Government intervention, while sometimes necessary, should be minimal, allowing businesses to operate freely and encouraging personal responsibility. The power should ultimately lie in the hands of the people, not the state."
"While the issue of racial disparity is undeniably a serious concern in modern society, I strongly believe in the principle of treating all citizens as individuals, rather than as members of a particular race. True equality can only be achieved when we focus on individual merit and character, rather than making broad generalizations based on race. Additionally, it's crucial to foster an environment where hard work, personal responsibility, and strong family values are celebrated, regardless of one's racial or ethnic background."
"Our national security should be the highest priority and I believe in maintaining a strong military presence globally. To safeguard our interests, we must not shy away from making difficult decisions, including asserting our rights in international waters or responding firmly against regimes that threaten global peace. It's crucial to foster strong alliances, but we mustn't compromise our ideals or national sovereignty for the sake of diplomatic expediency."
"I believe in the fundamental importance of the traditional family structure, which I see as the bedrock of our society. Additionally, I hold that individual liberties should not be overshadowed by identity politics, but rather respected and protected to ensure a society where everyone can prosper. It's crucial to remember that differences in perspectives and opinions can coexist in a harmonious and constructive manner."
"Understanding and acknowledging the challenges faced by various racial and ethnic communities is essential to the fabric of our society. However, it is crucial that these concerns are addressed in a manner that unifies rather than divides, promoting equality of opportunity, rather than guarantees of outcome. Similarly, with immigration, the nation's laws must be respected and enforced to maintain order, but the process should be fair and efficient to make the American Dream accessible to those willing to contribute positively."
"The principle of national sovereignty should be respected and upheld at all times. For example, in the case of territorial disputes in the South China Sea, it's crucial to prioritize diplomatic negotiations and international law over force or coercion. Economic growth and security interests can be pursued without compromising the respect for established boundaries and peaceful dialogue."
"I strongly believe in the importance of personal responsibility when it comes to healthcare. Individuals should have the freedom to choose their healthcare provider without government interference, allowing for competition and promoting better quality of service. Moreover, I am also a firm believer in the power of school choice, thinking that parents should be empowered to select the best educational opportunities for their children, whether that means public, private, charter, or homeschooling options."
"I firmly believe that while environmental conservation is essential, it should not interfere with economic growth or infringe upon personal liberties. We have to balance our need for progress with protecting our natural resources. Furthermore, the private sector, through innovation and competition, is best equipped to drive sustainable solutions, not overreaching governmental regulations."
"The issue of minimum wage has been a hot topic for discussion. While understanding the struggle of low-income families is critical, I believe that elevating the federal minimum wage could strain small businesses and potentially lead to job losses. Rather than enforcing a uniform wage increase, we should focus on fostering a business-friendly environment that encourages growth and increases job opportunities, while supplementing income for the lowest earners through targeted government programs."
"Efficient and responsible economic policy should prioritize the creation of a business-friendly environment that encourages entrepreneurship and promotes job growth. As such, we should be cautious about raising taxes on businesses, as this could discourage investment and innovation. Moreover, the preservation and respect for individual freedoms and rights, including the right to bear arms, remain paramount to our nation's identity."
"It is crucial that nations respect the sovereignty and autonomy of other countries, avoiding involvement in their internal affairs whenever possible. Excessive foreign intervention often leads to unforeseen consequences and can escalate conflicts rather than resolving them. Economic freedom, bolstered by free trade agreements, can foster growth and prosperity on a global scale."
"The importance of maintaining strong national borders cannot be overstated. Not only does it ensure the security and sovereignty of our nation, but it also allows us to manage our resources more effectively for the betterment of our citizens. A nation must have control over its borders to uphold its laws and values, safeguard its citizens, and preserve its unique cultural identity."
"The importance of maintaining a strong and viable national defense cannot be overstated. It plays a pivotal role in preserving the sovereignty of our nation and the freedoms we hold dear. Furthermore, integrating economic policies that stimulate growth and enterprise should be the cornerstone for any country's progress."
"Acknowledging that our environment should indeed be protected for future generations, it's also important to consider the economic implications and the practicality of proposed solutions. It's essential to foster innovation and market-based solutions, rather than imposing heavy-handed regulations that could potentially stifle growth and opportunity. Environmental stewardship and economic prosperity need not be mutually exclusive, and we can strive for a balanced approach that supports both these objectives."
"I believe that the United States must maintain a strong military presence globally to ensure our national security and the protection of our allies. On the issue of foreign trade, I stand for fair deals that respect American jobs and industries, allowing us to compete on a global scale while still prioritizing our nation's economic wellbeing. To my mind, international relations should always advance the interests of our nation without compromising our values and principles."
"I believe in the sanctity and traditional values of the family unit, viewing it as the bedrock of our society. When it comes to the topic of gender, I find it crucial that we respect the biological distinctions and roles that have been present throughout human history. It is essential to approach these matters with a sense of respect, dignity, and understanding for all, promoting a strong, balanced society."
"I firmly believe in the sanctity and traditional composition of the family unit, viewing it as the foundational bedrock of society. Policies should be implemented to positively reinforce these principles and support families, promoting an environment where children can prosper under the guidance of both a mother and a father. In terms of gender, I uphold the biological distinction of male and female, and I am wary of policies that blur these lines, as they could potentially bring about unintended societal consequences."
"While I affirm the importance of individual freedom, I firmly believe that traditional family structures play a crucial role in fostering stability and nurturing virtues in our society. Addressing gender issues, it's essential to respect the biological differences that exist, instead of completely erasing these distinctions. In short, preserving the traditional family unit and recognizing inherent biological differences are vital in maintaining the societal order and harmony."
I believe strongly in the principle of fiscal responsibility and limited government intervention in the marketplace. High taxes and excessive regulation can stifle business growth and innovation. It's essential to prioritize a balanced budget and encourage private sector development to sustain a prosperous economy.
"It's imperative that we prioritize the preservation of religious freedom, as it is a fundamental right enshrined in our Constitution. Individuals should have the liberty to practice their faith without any governmental interference, as long as it's not infringing upon others' rights. Moreover, the value of religious institutions in society should not be overlooked as they often foster a sense of community, morality, and charity."
"I firmly believe in the essential role of the traditional family structure in shaping our society's future. Upholding the institution of marriage as between a man and a woman is integral to fostering the development of our children and ensuring societal stability. Equality is essential, but it should not compromise the fundamental structures that have guided our nation for centuries."
"While I believe in the importance of a social safety net, I am concerned about the long-term sustainability of programs that do not incentivize self-sufficiency. It's essential to find a balance where we provide for those in need without discouraging personal responsibility and independence. I also hold that lowering taxes and reducing excessive government regulation are key to stimulating economic growth and prosperity for all."
"I firmly believe in the foundational importance of the traditional family structure to our society, wherein, each member has critical roles to play that contribute to overall societal development.

It is essential to respect these natural roles and identities while fostering an environment of understanding and acceptance for those who think differently."

Additionally, I advocate for religious beliefs to be respected in public life, not marginalized or silenced."
"I believe that every individual has the right to bear arms, as outlined in our Constitution, a freedom that should not be compromised under any circumstances. On education, school choice should be prioritized, providing parents with the power to choose the best educational setting for their children, regardless of their socioeconomic status. As for health-related issues, I am a firm supporter of free-market solutions which spur competition and innovation, leading to improved quality and accessibility of healthcare for all citizens."
"It's important to understand that everyone, regardless of race or ethnicity, deserves equal opportunities and rights. However, I believe that policies such as affirmative action should be replaced with a system that promotes fairness and rewards individual merit and effort. A society that encourages personal responsibility and self-reliance, rather than fostering an environment of dependency, will be more successful in the long run."
"I firmly believe in the principles of limited government interference, personal freedoms, and free markets. With regards to healthcare, I am convinced that private sector competition and consumer choice are vital to improving the quality and affordability of care. I also uphold the necessity for strong national defense and ensuring security for our citizens at home and abroad."
"I firmly believe in the principle of free-market capitalism, where businesses and individuals have the liberty to compete and innovate without excessive government interference. I feel that by creating an environment that encourages entrepreneurship, we can boost economic growth and ensure prosperity for all. High tax burdens and over-regulation can stifle the entrepreneurial spirit and hinder economic progress."
"When it comes to issues of race, it is crucial to honor our shared commitment to equal opportunity and individual liberty. I believe that we should focus on fostering environments where anyone, regardless of their race or background, can achieve their potential through hard work and personal merit. Our society should strive to uphold these principles, as our strength lies in our unity, inclusivity, and respect for the rights and dignity of all individuals."
"While I believe it's important to care for our planet and its finite resources, I also strongly support maintaining a thriving economy. Implementing strict environmental regulations can sometimes hinder entrepreneurial growth and innovation. Thus, I advocate for balanced policies that allow for both environmental preservation and economic prosperity."
"I believe that it is vital to maintain the integrity and sanctity of the traditional family structure. The erosion of these values might lead to societal instability and undermine the moral fabric of our communities. Fostering individual responsibility and self-reliance should be at the heart of our efforts to create a prosperous, successful, and unified nation."
"I firmly believe in the importance of national sovereignty and putting the interests of our nation first in global policy decisions. It is essential to prioritize strong and secure borders to protect our citizens and uphold law and order. While international cooperation can be beneficial, it should never come at the expense of our country's economic interests or national security."
"I believe in the importance of preserving the fundamental right to freely practice one's religion as enshrined in our Constitution. It's important to uphold these values as they form the bedrock of our diverse and pluralistic society. In parallel, we must ensure that these freedoms do not infringe upon the rights and liberties of others, maintaining a balanced approach to religious freedom."
"I believe that traditional family values play a crucial role in providing a stable society and a strong moral compass for individuals. The education system, in my view, should play its part in reinforcing these values and promoting personal responsibility. Furthermore, I support the notion that hard work and business enterprise should be encouraged and rewarded, as this drives our economy and promotes individual freedom."
"I firmly believe in upholding the sanctity of religious freedom as enshrined in our Constitution. Any individual, regardless of their faith, should have the right to practice their religion freely, without oppressive interference from the government. However, it's vital that we maintain a clear separation of church and state to ensure that no single religion dictates our nation's laws or public policies."
"While it is essential to recognize the diverse mosaic of races and cultures that make up our nation, I believe the crux of our focus should be on unifying efforts rather than divisive ones. Individual character and merit should be valued above all else, rather than race or ethnicity. The beauty of our nation lies in its ability to celebrate diversity while upholding the shared value that every citizen is equal under the law."
"I believe in the importance of a free-market economy as a catalyst for growth and prosperity. Lowering taxes and reducing government regulations on businesses allows for innovation and expansion, which ultimately benefits everyone. Equally, I strongly feel that a robust national defense is paramount in preserving our sovereignty and maintaining global peace."
"On the topic of religious freedom, it is paramount that we uphold the foundational principles of our nation. The First Amendment protects the rights of every individual to practice their religion without interference or coercion from the government. Furthermore, restricting religious expression or forcing any American to act against their deeply held beliefs is a violation of the personal liberties that our country holds dear."
"While there is certainly room for improvement in healthcare, I firmly believe that the market competition, not government control, is the best way to drive down costs and increase quality. Governmental control often leads to more bureaucracy, inefficiency and lack of choice for people. I hold steadfast in my conviction that individual freedom and responsibility, not government intervention, are the key to prosperity and societal growth."
"While I strongly believe that every individual, regardless of their race, should be given equal opportunities and rights, I also believe that the concept of meritocracy should not be compromised in the process. Policies should be designed in a way that promotes equality, fairness, and individual effort rather than creating undue advantage for any particular group. In the end, it's the individual's abilities and hard work that should determine their success, and not their racial or ethnic background."
"In my perspective, it is crucial for the United States to maintain a strong military presence across the globe, including the Middle East. This is not about meddling in other countries' affairs, but preserving our national security and ensuring global stability. Abandoning our strategic positions may provide openings for radical entities and jeopardize our allies' trust, which could ultimately undermine our own security."
"While acknowledging that disparities among races can exist due to historic and systemic factors, it's essential to focus on the principles of individual liberty and personal responsibility. Instead of encouraging racial division, we should strive for a society where everyone is treated equally under the law and has the opportunity to succeed based on their merits and efforts. The goal should be to create a country where one's race does not predetermine their success or failure."
"While I firmly believe in the importance of responsible stewardship of our natural resources, I also maintain that economic growth and environmental conservation are not mutually exclusive. Free market principles and technological innovation can contribute significantly to solving environmental problems. Therefore, the government should encourage, not hinder, the private sector's role in leading sustainable practices."
The issue of international trade is one of great importance. We believe in the power of free markets to stimulate economic growth and foster innovation. Policies such as excessive tariffs and trade barriers can stifle this growth and ultimately harm both domestic industries and consumers.
"I believe in the importance of limited government intervention in economic affairs, as it allows for greater personal freedom and encourages market competition. Additionally, respect for traditional social values and institutions plays a crucial role in maintaining social cohesion and moral order. I also see national security and law enforcement as paramount to a functioning society."
"I strongly believe in the principles of free market capitalism, where businesses are allowed to grow and compete without excessive government interference. High tax rates and excessive regulations stifle economic growth and innovation. Individual financial responsibility and economic freedom are key to national prosperity."
"I firmly believe in the fundamental principle of religious liberty, a cornerstone of our great nation's constitution. It is of utmost importance that all citizens are allowed to freely practice their faith without interference from government entities. Moreover, I do not support any legislation that infringes upon this right or that forces people to compromise their deeply held religious beliefs and values."
"Our nation's economy flourishes best when individuals and businesses are given the freedom to innovate, compete, and prosper, without excessive government interference. Lower tax rates and decreased regulation, in my opinion, stimulate growth and foster a vibrant entrepreneurial spirit. We should also place a high value on personal responsibility and individual liberties, creating an environment where anyone willing to work hard and play by the rules can thrive."
"While I wholeheartedly support the need for environmental stewardship, I believe that the approach should be balanced and not compromise our economic growth. We need to pursue energy policies that leverage our domestic resources responsibly, ensuring both job creation and environmental integrity. This includes a sensible approach to regulations and a commitment to technological innovation."
"The traditional family structure, I believe, has proven itself over generations to be a strong bedrock for social development and individual well-being. The roles of men and women, while not rigid, often complement each other in nurturing their children and maintaining a stable home. I value these tried and tested roles and structures, as they help maintain a sense of order and stability in society."
"While it is crucial to acknowledge the need for environmental conservation, it is equally important to balance this with economic growth and development. It is possible to embrace sustainable practices without hindering the progress of industries. Strive for innovation and advocate for technologies that both promote economic prosperity and protect our natural resources."
Balancing the budget and reducing the national debt should be a priority for our government. The philosophy of spending beyond our means is not sustainable and it puts an unfair burden on future generations. Robust economic growth and fiscal responsibility are keys to ensuring our nation's prosperity and security.
"The issue of international trade agreements, particularly those that involve China, is of paramount concern. It's my belief that any deal we engage in should prioritize American interests, ensuring that our industries are protected and our workers are not disadvantaged. Moreover, remaining vigilant about intellectual property theft and unfair trade practices is essential for maintaining our technological edge and economic vitality."

"The issue of national security is paramount and must be prioritized above all else. It's important to maintain strong borders and a robust defense system to protect our citizens and our values. This doesn't mean turning our backs on diplomacy, but rather advocating for an assertive foreign policy that prioritizes our nation's interests."
"I believe that a free market system is critical for the growth and prosperity of our nation. This system has the power to stimulate innovation, competition, and economic mobility. Furthermore, limited government intervention ensures that hard work and individual responsibility are appropriately rewarded, fostering a stronger and more sustainable economy."
"While it's crucial to provide humanitarian aid to those in need, it's equally important for nations to prioritize the wellbeing and economic stability of their own citizens first. Mismanagement of foreign aid can often lead to unintended consequences such as corruption or destabilization. Boundaries and sovereign rights of nations ought to be respected to maintain international peace and order."
"While I wholeheartedly agree that preserving our planet's natural resources is of paramount importance, I do believe in the potential of market-based solutions and technological advancements to help us achieve this goal. Too much regulatory intervention can stifle innovation and economic growth. We must strive for a balance that allows for both environmental sustainability and economic prosperity."
Our nation must prioritize maintaining a robust defense budget to ensure we are equipped to deal with any threats to our sovereignty or allies. Fiscal responsibility and limited government intervention in the economic sphere are key to fostering self-reliance and individual prosperity. We should also be cautious about international agreements that may constrain our economic growth or compromise our national security.
"I believe in the importance of maintaining a strong family unit as a cornerstone of society. Traditional family values foster a sense of stability and offer a nurturing environment for the upbringing of children. Additionally, while respecting everyone's individual rights and freedoms, it's important to note that biological differences between genders do exist and they often contribute to the diverse and complementary roles we play in society."
"While I understand the urgency surrounding climate change and the need for a cleaner environment, I am firm in my belief that market-based solutions and technological advancements can lead us to a sustainable future. Over-regulation stifles innovation and can endanger our prosperity. It is crucial that our approach to environmental challenges balances economic stability with progress towards a cleaner world."
"I firmly believe in the importance of traditional family structures and their impact on society's health and prosperity. Moreover, I advocate for individual freedoms and responsibilities, acknowledging that each person should reserve the right to make their own decisions about their life and family, so long as they do not infringe upon the rights of others. On matters relating to gender, I maintain that it is crucial to respect and acknowledge biological differences, while also valuing the unique roles and contributions of both men and women in society."
"I firmly believe that the best form of governance is one that encourages personal responsibility and self-reliance. On healthcare, I prefer a system where individuals can choose their coverage, rather than a government-controlled, one-size-fits-all model. Furthermore, in education, I advocate for policies that empower parents to choose the best schooling option for their children, promoting competition and therefore, raising standards."
"While it's undeniable that we must take care of our planet and its resources, it's important to balance environmental protection with economic growth. It's crucial to promote innovation and encourage businesses to adopt sustainable practices rather than imposing stringent regulations that could hinder progress. After all, a thriving economy and a healthy environment are not mutually exclusive, but can coexist with the right strategies."
"It is crucial to appreciate the importance of strong borders and immigration controls, as nations have the inherent right to protect their sovereignty and maintain their cultural values. The Middle East's ongoing turmoil further underlines the need for a robust, well-equipped defense force ready to respond to any pertinent threats. These strategic measures will not only ensure national security but also uphold economic stability."
"Our nation's strength lies in its commitment to individual rights, free markets, and limited government. On the topic of healthcare, I believe we should encourage market competition instead of overwhelming bureaucratic control. Personal choice and affordability should be at the forefront of our healthcare policies."
"While I completely respect the evolving definitions of family in our society, I firmly believe in the traditional family structure and its significance in creating a stable environment for child rearing. Similarly, I reckon that respecting the biological differences between genders doesn't equate to promoting inequality but is rather an acknowledgment of our inherent uniqueness. Individual freedom should be cherished, but societal norms also play a crucial role in fostering coherence and cultural continuity."
"Diversity truly enriches our society, but it should not be the only factor considered when making key societal decisions. Merit and qualifications should play a principal role in areas such as education and employment, rather than focusing exclusively on racial background. We can strive to eliminate prejudice and discrimination by promoting equal opportunities rather than assigning benefits or penalties based on race."
"The notion of raising the minimum wage is certainly well-intentioned, but it fails to acknowledge the potential negative impact on small businesses. Many of these operations run on razor-thin margins and may not have the ability to absorb these added costs without reducing hours, laying off employees, or even closing their doors completely. I believe we should prioritize policies that create a fertile ground for these businesses to flourish, simultaneously promoting job growth and economic stability."
"I firmly believe in the significance of limited government intervention, fiscal responsibility, and the preservation of individual freedoms. The issue of national debt concerns me; I believe in balanced budgets and reducing unnecessary public spending. Furthermore, I stand by the importance of free markets as the primary drivers of economic growth and prosperity."
"While I firmly believe in the importance of equal opportunity for all Americans, regardless of race or ethnicity, I am also a strong advocate for upholding law and order in our society. There is a need to ensure our immigration system is reformed to be more efficient and fair, but it should also prioritize the safety and security of our existing citizens. Furthermore, any form of justice should be based on individual actions and character, rather than categorized by racial or ethnic groupings."
"I believe in the importance of maintaining traditional family values and structures as the cornerstone of society. Moreover, self-reliance and individual liberties should be promoted, rather than relying heavily on government assistance. Economic growth and stability can best be achieved through free-market principles, which encourage competition and innovation."
"While I firmly believe in preserving the environment for future generations, it is crucial to balance the need for conservation with realistic economic considerations. Overregulation can have detrimental effects on our nation's economy and job market. Innovative, market-based solutions should be pursued to incentivize sustainable practices among businesses, instead of relying heavily on government mandates."
"I firmly believe in the sanctity of family as the bedrock of society, considering the traditional family unit as the ideal environment for raising children. Regarding gender issues, I posit that individual biology should play a determinant role, with its inherent differences acknowledged and respected, rather than attempting to blur or erase them. This perspective advocates for a society that values tradition, stability, and natural order."
"It's necessary to maintain a robust national defense and prioritize our national interests in international relations. When every country is economically and geopolitically secure within its borders, global progress is a natural outcome. Furthermore, free-market principles should guide our trade agreements to ensure a fair exchange of goods and resources."
"I believe in the importance of maintaining traditional family values as a cornerstone of our society. In terms of gender roles, I consider it crucial to respect the natural distinctions that exist between men and women, as these differences add to the richness and diversity of societies. I see this balance as a fundamental part of harmonious family life and societal progression."
"I believe in the power of free market capitalism as a catalyst for economic growth and prosperity. Limiting regulations and taxation allows businesses, particularly small businesses, to thrive and to create jobs. Enabling this entrepreneurial spirit is essential to ensuring the strength and resiliency of our nation's economy."
"While it's important to stand up for justice and equality, it's also crucial to emphasize law and order. When it comes to immigration, a measured and legal approach helps us better serve the interests of the nation, ensuring that those who come in are willing to contribute productively to our society. A nation cannot sustain without clear, enforceable borders and an established process for legal immigration."
"While it's undeniable that our environment needs to be protected and preserved, we need to understand that any environmental policies must take into account the economic implications and impact on jobs. It's important to balance the needs of the environment with the livelihoods of real, hardworking individuals. Innovating within existing industries to make them more environmentally friendly is a more sustainable strategy than halting them altogether."
"While acknowledging the vast complexity of issues surrounding gender and family, I firmly believe in the sanctity and foundational importance of the traditional family structure for a healthy society. I also have deep respect for individual autonomy and believe in the freedom of self-determination. However, I see merit in maintaining certain societal norms that have stood the test of time, while remaining open to responsible and thoughtful evolution."
"I firmly believe that the institution of family, founded on the traditional values of a husband and wife, plays an essential role in the stability and growth of our society. Parenthood should not be influenced by a passing wave of societal trends but should remain grounded in biological realities and time-tested social structures. While I am open to discussions on improving the welfare and rights of all individuals, I remain skeptical of policies that attempt to redefine the intrinsic nature and meaning of family and parenting."
"I firmly believe in the principles of free market capitalism as a driver of economic growth and prosperity. Raising minimum wage may seem like an immediate solution, but it could inadvertently cripple small businesses and lead to job losses. Rather, I propose we focus on equipping individuals with the skills needed to secure and excel in higher-paying jobs, thereby naturally increasing wages."
"As an individual, I deeply respect the importance of religious freedom and the pivotal role it plays in shaping a truly democratic society. I firmly believe in the principle of upholding one's faith and traditions without any fear of persecution. However, it's crucial that these beliefs do not infringe upon the rights, liberties, and safety of others."
"In assessing our economic landscape, it's crucial that we prioritize fiscal responsibility and support policies that promote economic freedom and individual initiative. Overregulation and excessive taxation can stifle entrepreneurship and hinder economic growth. High-value solutions are often found in the private sector, where competition can drive innovation and efficiency."
"I believe that the traditional family structure, consisting of two parents and their children, is fundamental to a healthy society. It provides a stable environment for the raising and nurturing of children. Additionally, I firmly uphold that there are inherent differences between genders, which should be appreciated and respected, rather than dismissed or blurred."
"While it is paramount to prioritize economic growth and individual liberty, it is equally important to preserve our natural resources for future generations. I believe in a balanced approach towards environmental conservation that encourages responsible use and management, emphasizing free-market solutions and technological innovations. We must promote economic incentives for businesses to reduce their environmental impact and insist on individual responsibility, rather than relying solely on government regulation."
"I firmly believe in the importance of upholding the Constitution, particularly when it comes to the Second Amendment. It's crucial to safeguard the rights of law-abiding citizens to protect themselves and their families. Additionally, I am a strong proponent of smaller government, as I believe that the best way to promote prosperity and freedom is to limit its role in the everyday lives of Americans."
"I firmly believe in the importance of upholding traditional family values and religious freedom as they form the bedrock of our society. Every individual has the right to practice their faith freely, without the fear of persecution or discrimination. However, the sanctity of religion should not be exploited for political motives or to infringe upon the rights of others."
"The responsibility of maintaining national security should not be compromised. This involves stringent border control and immigration policies to ensure that the citizens are protected from potential external threats. While upholding human rights is important, it must be balanced with national interest and security."
"I believe in the importance of maintaining national sovereignty and upholding international law. Global relations should be conducted on the basis of mutual respect, cooperation, and mutual benefits. I am not in favor of interventions in the internal affairs of other nations, as I believe that each country should have the right to self-determination and choose their own path based on their national interests and cultural values."
"I firmly believe in the power of free markets and limited government intervention in the economy. High taxation rates can stifle entrepreneurial spirit and limit economic growth. Therefore, it's crucial that we promote policies that encourage individual financial responsibility and create an environment conducive to business development and economic prosperity."
"While it is vital to prioritize economic growth and development for our nation, it is equally essential to consider the long-term impacts of our actions on the environment. However, I firmly believe that we do not necessarily have to sacrifice one for the other. Through innovation, proper regulation, and public-private partnerships, we can foster economic prosperity without compromising the health and sustainability of our natural resources."
"I firmly believe in the importance of maintaining religious freedom as a fundamental right for all individuals. This ensures that every person can practice their beliefs without interference or persecution. It's crucial to respect and tolerate the diversity of religious beliefs within our society, thereby fostering peaceful coexistence."
"I firmly believe in the importance of maintaining strong national defenses and upholding the sovereignty of nations. International diplomacy should be built on mutual respect and recognition of each nation's unique cultural heritage and political system. It's crucial that we foster an international environment that promotes free trade and open markets, as they are key components to economic prosperity and global stability."
"It's crucial to maintain strong national borders in order to protect the sovereignty and security of our country. Open borders, while they might seem compassionate, can lead to economic stress and potential threats to national security. Rather than blanket policies, we should be focusing on a balanced approach to immigration that welcomes individuals based on merit and the potential contributions they can make to our society."
"While it's undeniable that our great nation is in need of certain reforms, it's crucial that we prioritize fiscal responsibility and individual liberty. On the topic of healthcare, for instance, I firmly believe that free-market solutions, rather than government interventions, can better drive down costs and improve quality. Upholding the principles of personal responsibility, limited government, and free enterprise is, in my view, the most effective path towards a prosperous America."
"Fiscal responsibility is essential for the growth and stability of our nation. It is crucial that we prioritize curbing excessive government spending and work towards reducing the national debt. By encouraging entrepreneurship and free market principles, we can foster an environment conducive to economic prosperity and individual freedom."
"While we must regard the preservation of our natural resources as paramount, it’s crucial to seek a balance that doesn't compromise economic growth and individual freedoms. I believe in responsible stewardship of our environment, but am wary of some measures that may inadvertently throttle the progress of our industries. Thus, for sustainable solutions, we should encourage innovation and incentivize businesses to adopt environmentally friendly practices."
"I firmly believe in the importance of fiscal responsibility, with an emphasis on minimizing excessive government spending and focusing on balanced budgets. I also think that individual liberties and free market principles can lead to a prosperous society. It is crucial to maintain a strong defense for national security while respecting the rule of law and upholding traditional values."
"Every individual, no matter their race or heritage, should have the freedom and opportunity to pursue their own version of the American Dream. However, the rule of law and the sovereignty of this nation is of paramount importance; our immigration system should be reformed to facilitate a more streamlined, legal process. This would provide a fair and equitable solution for all, maintaining our nation's security, economic stability, and the ideals upon which it was founded."
"In regards to global trade, it's crucial to prioritize our national interests and safeguard our industries at home. While international cooperation and trade are important, they should not come at the expense of domestic economic health and job security. We must ensure that trade deals benefit our nation's businesses and workers, not just multinational corporations."
"The traditional family structure, with a father and a mother, has for centuries been the bedrock of our society. I firmly believe in supporting policies that strengthen this family unit, especially when it comes to child upbringing. Policies and societal norms that encourage children to grow up in a stable, nurturing environment with both a mother and a father figure tend to produce more balanced individuals, fostering a more balanced society."
"Strengthening our borders isn't about excluding those who seek the American dream; rather, it's about ensuring we have a lawful and orderly process for their entry. This allows us to maintain national security, uphold the rule of law, and protect jobs for our citizens. Reducing illegal immigration paves the way for a fair and efficient system to welcome those who wish to contribute to our great nation."
"When it comes to the debate on gender issues, particularly in the realm of parenting, I believe it is critical to uphold the traditional family structure. I value the distinct and vital roles that both mothers and fathers play in the upbringing of children. In my perspective, preserving the conventional family unit is essential for the social, emotional, and mental development of children."
"I firmly believe in the sanctity of traditional family values as the cornerstone of a stable society. I also uphold the view that gender roles, rooted in biological differences and societal norms, should be respected and not blurred. As we navigate the complexities of modern life, I believe we must safeguard these time-honored principles for the well-being of our future generations."
"The United Nations' push for global governance encroaches on the sovereignty of individual nations, particularly the United States. The U.S. should maintain its authority to self-govern, focusing on domestic issues and its own national security. Involvement in international bodies should not compromise the nation's autonomy or the rights and freedoms of its citizens."
"I firmly believe in the importance of individual liberty and personal responsibility. When it comes to healthcare, I think we should prioritize market competition and personal choice rather than government-run programs. Our economy is best served, and our citizens most fairly treated, when free enterprise is allowed to flourish without excessive government intervention."
"I believe that the most effective way to address racial disparities is through promoting policies that encourage equal opportunity for everyone, regardless of their race. It's crucial to recognize the inherent dignity and potential in all individuals and to foster environments where everyone can thrive based on their abilities and hard work, not their ethnic background. Fairness, liberty, and personal responsibility should be the guiding principles in our approach to racial issues."
"The Iran Nuclear Deal is a concerning issue, mainly due to its lack of surefire ways to prevent Iran's illicit nuclear activities. It's crucial to press for more rigorous monitoring and inspection measures within any such agreement, and more broadly, to pursue a foreign policy that stands firm against the proliferation of nuclear weapons. It's in our national interest to ensure that all countries, especially those with a history of hostility towards the United States, cannot acquire these dangerous weapons."
"I believe that we must uphold and respect the rule of law when addressing the issue of immigration. The process of entering and living in the United States should be done legally and ethically. While understanding the need for humanitarian compassion, we also have to ensure the security of our nation and provide fair opportunities for those who are already citizens."
"I firmly believe in the importance and value of traditional family structures, seeing them as an essential pillar in creating a stable society. Regarding gender, I feel that biological distinctions play a crucial role, shaping our identities and responsibilities. While I respect individual choices and freedom, I believe it's important to consider the potential societal impacts of altering long-standing norms."
"While it's important to acknowledge the need for reform in areas of racial justice in our society, we cannot overlook the importance of law and order. It is also essential to understand that any immigration policy must prioritize national security and economic prosperity, without compromising on the tenets of human dignity and respect. In essence, we should strive for a balanced approach that accounts for both justice and order, as well as the economic sustainability of our nation."
"I believe in the principle of equality, where every individual is treated based on their character and actions, not based on their race or ethnicity. I see value in promoting a society where opportunities are accessible to all, regardless of race, and where we celebrate our shared American identity. It is our shared values, principles, and commitment to the constitution that unites us, transcending racial and ethnic differences."
"I firmly believe in the concept of individual responsibility and freedom when it comes to making healthcare decisions. The government's role should be limited to ensuring a competitive, transparent market that empowers individuals to make the best choices for themselves and their families. As for education, I am a strong supporter of school choice, as it allows parents to decide what’s best for their children and encourages excellence and innovation within our educational system."
"The recent proposal to increase foreign aid is misguided. Although supporting our global neighbors is noble, we must focus on addressing the issues at our doorstep first. By prioritizing our own national debt and economic stability, we can become a stronger nation which can, in turn, contribute more effectively to global causes."
"I firmly believe that the right to bear arms, as outlined in our Second Amendment, is a fundamental principle that safeguards the freedom of each American citizen. It is crucial for self-defense and as a safeguard against potential government tyranny. Any restrictions or infringements upon this right should be thoroughly reviewed and prudently considered."
"Secure borders, I believe, are vital to maintaining our sovereignty and protecting our citizens. Allowing unchecked immigration not only undermines our legal system, but it also poses potential economic and security risks. A balanced, streamlined immigration process is essential to uphold the rule of law and ensure the prosperity of our nation."
"When considering the issue of international trade, particularly with China, it's crucial to put America's economic security first. Unfair trade practices, such as intellectual property theft, need to be addressed firmly and concisely. Industries crucial to American employment and economic growth should be protected to ensure the prosperity and well-being of our nation's citizens."
"I firmly believe in the principles of a free market economy, where competition and individual enterprise drive economic growth and innovation. Heavy government intervention and over-regulation can often stifle these essential forces, leading to inefficiencies. Furthermore, I think fiscal responsibility and reduced public spending can contribute to sustainable economic stability and growth."
"The notion of drastically increasing the minimum wage, though well-intentioned, often overlooks the potential negative impact on small businesses. These enterprises, the backbone of our economy, may struggle to bear such financial burdens, potentially leading to job cuts or business closures. It is essential that we find a sustainable solution that protects both workers and businesses for long-term economic stability."
"I firmly believe in the importance of preserving our natural resources for future generations. However, I also value the role of economic growth and innovation in achieving this aim. It's crucial to balance environmental conservation with responsible development, leveraging technology and encouraging market-based solutions."
"As an advocate for fiscal responsibility, I believe our education system should be approached with efficiency and efficacy in mind. It's crucial to invest in programs that foster competition and choice, promoting excellence in education rather than just pouring more money into a system that has shown inconsistent results. We should focus on equipping our children with practical skills and knowledge that will prepare them for the workforce and global economy."
"I firmly believe that a quality education should be accessible to every child, irrespective of their geographical location or socioeconomic status. However, I contend that this does not necessitate a greater hand from the federal government, but rather a stronger focus on parental choice, local control, and competition among schools. Empowering parents and local communities to take the reins of education bolsters a sense of personal responsibility and can lead to more effective, tailored educational approaches."
"Strong fiscal responsibility is key to ensuring the prosperity and longevity of our nation. Lower taxes and minimized governmental intervention stimulate economic growth by providing businesses and individuals with more financial freedom. Moreover, it is crucial that we prioritize reducing the national debt in order to secure a prosperous future for the next generation."
"While I believe in the importance of protecting our natural resources for future generations, I also hold a strong conviction that this can be achieved through free-market solutions and technological innovations. Over-regulations can hinder economic growth and innovation. Therefore, it is essential to strike a balance between environmental preservation and economic progress."
"I firmly believe in the fundamental principle of religious freedom, a right protected under the First Amendment of our Constitution. This includes the right to practice one's religion without interference or persecution, as well as the right not to be forced to adhere to a particular religious belief. I also uphold the separation of church and state, ensuring that government does not favor or endorse any particular religion, thereby preserving the integrity of both institutions."
"The issue of tax reform necessitates careful consideration and responsible action. High taxation, particularly on small businesses and hardworking citizens, can stifle economic growth, innovation, and the spirit of entrepreneurship. Therefore, it is crucial that we work toward fair and effective tax policies that nurture economic prosperity without overburdening taxpayers."
"In light of the ongoing discussions about religious freedom, I firmly believe in the foundational principle of our great nation that guarantees an individual's right to practice their faith freely and without interference. This applies to all citizens irrespective of their religious denomination. Equally important is the idea that no faith should be allowed to infringe upon the rights and freedoms of others, maintaining a balanced and respectful society."
"Our nation's education system should promote individual achievement and excellence, not a one-size-fits-all approach. The focus should be on empowering parents with the freedom to choose the best schooling options for their children, be it public, private, or homeschooling. This will foster competition and continual improvement among schools, leading to a more robust and effective education system."
"I believe that the focus should be on fostering unity and promoting individual merit, rather than emphasizing the differences among various racial and ethnic groups. We need to value each person for their skills, talents, and contributions to society, rather than their ethnic background. Policy decisions should be colorblind, upholding the ideal of equal opportunity for all citizens."
"While it's essential to work towards creating an inclusive society that guarantees equal opportunities for all, it's equally important to uphold the laws and processes established by our constitution. Any discussion about immigration should prioritise the security of American citizens and the integrity of our borders. Adherence to immigration laws, just like any other laws, is fundamental to maintaining order and fairness in our society."
"I firmly believe in the foundational American principle that all men are created equal. I feel it is completely necessary to ensure that every citizen, regardless of their racial background, is treated with the same respect, fairness, and justice under the law. On the topic of immigration, I am an advocate of strong border security and believe that it is essential to uphold the law, while simultaneously developing a streamlined and efficient process for legal immigration."
"While respecting the foundational principle of our nation that calls for the separation of church and state, I firmly believe that religious liberty remains a cornerstone of our democracy.

Lower taxes for businesses can stimulate growth, job creation and result in broader societal benefits. Reducing unnecessary government regulations can unleash the potential of entrepreneurs and innovators, making our economy stronger and more resilient."
"As we continue to ponder upon our nation's path, it is essential to balance compassion with respect for the rule of law. On the immigration front, we must acknowledge that our country was founded and built by immigrants, yet we cannot ignore the importance of a secure border. A fair and orderly immigration process is a cornerstone of a sovereign nation, ensuring the safety and integrity for all involved."
"I believe in the importance of preserving the traditions and values that have shaped our society. When it comes to issues like marriage and family structures, these institutions serve as pillars of stability and should be respected. Changes to such fundamental structures should be considered cautiously, ensuring we do not inadvertently disrupt the balance that has allowed our society to thrive."
"While I understand and respect the importance of protecting our natural environment for future generations, I firmly believe that economic growth should not be stifled in the name of environmental protection. Policies need to strike a balance, ensuring that businesses can continue to thrive and create jobs, while also adhering to reasonable, scientifically-backed standards for pollution and waste. An overregulated market can detrimentally impact our economy and the livelihoods of everyday Americans, and therefore, any environmental legislation must be sensible and considerate of these factors."
"It is paramount that we maintain a strong national defense to ensure the protection of our country's values, freedom, and democracy. The United States must prioritize its own interests, while still acknowledging the importance of fostering healthy international relations. A robust and nuanced approach to immigration policy is also essential, balancing the need for border security with a recognition of the valuable contributions immigrants have made to our nation."
"While it's undeniable that each race and ethnicity has its unique challenges and history, I believe that our focus should be on cultivating individual responsibility and unity. The best way to progress as a society is to acknowledge our shared humanity and common values. Every individual should be judged on the basis of their character, actions, and merits, rather than their racial or ethnic background."
"While I acknowledge the dedication and hard work of public school teachers, I firmly believe that parents should have the freedom to choose the best educational path for their children. This flexibility can be achieved through a well-regulated voucher system, which would enhance educational competition and, in turn, overall quality. Also, the system should encourage individual responsibility and self-reliance, as these are the bedrock of a prosperous society."
"While it's essential to be responsible stewards of our environment, it's equally important to balance those initiatives with the needs of our economy. Over-regulation often stifles business growth, innovation, and job creation. A pragmatic approach to environmental policy would rely on innovation and market-based solutions, rather than heavy-handed government intervention."
"While I fully understand and appreciate the importance of maintaining the sustainability of our environment, I believe it is crucial to balance these efforts with the needs of our economy. It's important to leverage technological advancements and innovation to counter climate changes, rather than imposing restrictive regulations that could potentially hinder economic growth. I am convinced that a free market can offer effective solutions to environmental problems."
"I firmly believe in the importance of safeguarding our constitutional rights, including the right to bear arms. Restrictive gun control laws, while well-intentioned, often fail to consider the significance of individual freedoms and liberties, and tend to disproportionately affect law-abiding citizens. I also believe in empowering local communities and law enforcement agencies to handle their unique public safety needs."
"I deeply value the traditional family structure with its inherent roles and responsibilities, which I believe, contributes to a stable society. I am of the view that each gender has unique strengths and contributions that should be acknowledged and respected. We should strive to uphold these values while also acknowledging the personal freedom of every individual."
"While it is important to ensure the welfare of our citizens, it is equally crucial to encourage individual responsibility and self-sufficiency. Over-reliance on government subsidies can potentially stifle innovation and economic growth. Hence, I firmly believe in limited government intervention and a free-market economic system that stimulates competition and innovation."
"While it is crucial to ensure that everyone has access to fundamental services, we also need to consider the implications of excessive governmental intervention in the economy. A free market system fosters innovation and competition, which can lead to higher quality goods and services. Furthermore, limiting regulations and tax burdens can incentivize businesses to invest and create more jobs, driving economic growth."
"I firmly believe in the value of traditional family structures as the cornerstone of society, including the integral roles that both mothers and fathers play in a child's development. It's paramount that we nurture and support these fundamental units for the wellbeing of future generations. Furthermore, while recognizing and respecting individual choices, it's crucial to not overlook the biological differences and unique roles associated with each gender."
"I believe that it's essential for parents to have control over their children's education, including the ability to choose whether their kids attend public, private, or homeschool programs. This choice will not only promote competition and thus improvement among schools but also ensure that our children are getting an education that aligns with our values and beliefs. Additionally, I strongly advocate for fiscal responsibility in our healthcare system, where patient choice and market competition can drive down costs, rather than a one-size-fits-all government-controlled solution."
"I firmly believe in the sanctity and significance of religious liberty, as it is a fundamental human right enshrined in our constitution. The freedom to practice one's faith, or choose not to have one, without interference or coercion from the state is paramount. Furthermore, I think it's crucial that we respect the rich tapestry of diverse beliefs that make up our society, always fostering an environment of mutual understanding and tolerance."
"While I understand and empathize with the difficult conditions that drive people to seek better opportunities in our nation, I firmly believe in the importance of legal and orderly immigration processes. I also acknowledge the need for racial justice, but I contend that it can best be achieved through individual responsibility, promoting strong family values, and encouraging economic prosperity for all, rather than through governmental intervention or identity politics."
"It's essential to prioritize economic growth and individual wealth creation, as it drives innovation and prosperity. High taxes and over-regulation can stifle entrepreneurial spirit and hinder business expansion. Thus, we should foster an environment that encourages free enterprise and competition, as it leads to efficiency and progress."

It is crucial to strike a balance between environmental initiatives and economic growth. Innovation and free market principles can be harnessed in the endeavor to address environmental challenges while preserving individual freedoms and economic prosperity."
"While the push for a higher federal minimum wage may be well-intended, it's crucial to consider the potential economic repercussions such a shift could produce. Increased labor costs can burden small businesses and potentially lead to job losses, especially in sectors with tight margins. An approach encouraging job growth, skills training, and market-driven wage increases may be a more balanced and effective path towards prosperity."
"I firmly believe in the preservation of traditional family values and the roles they play in the greater societal structure. When it comes to gender issues, I advocate for the recognition and respect of biological differences, not erasure. It is my conviction that promoting stable family structures and acknowledging innate gender distinctions would lead to a stronger, more unified society."
"While the spirit of compassion underpinning welfare programs is admirable, it's essential for us to acknowledge that an overreliance on these programs may ultimately disincentivize self-reliance and personal responsibility. We need to prioritize a system that encourages job creation, hard work and entrepreneurship – key pillars of a thriving economy. At the end of the day, it's about fostering an environment where hand-ups, not hand-outs, become the norm."
"I strongly believe in the sanctity and protection of individual rights and freedoms. On the issue of gun control, I support measured regulations that do not infrarct upon a citizen's Second Amendment right. It's vital that we prioritize the safety and liberty of our citizens without compromising the foundations of our Constitution."
"While recognizing the inherent value of everyone's right to access quality healthcare, I firmly believe in the principles of personal responsibility and limited government intervention. The notion of a government-run healthcare system, in my view, undermines the spirit of competition and innovation that drives our medical industry. Likewise, in the field of education, it's crucial to empower parents with choices and foster competition among schools to provide the highest quality of education for our children."
"While it's essential to prioritize economic growth and opportunity for all, it's equally important to consider the principles of financial responsibility and fiscal restraint. The national debt is not just a number but a burden on future generations and could potentially destabilize our economy. Therefore, strategies for economic growth should also involve serious efforts to reduce our national debt and limit government spending."
"The family unit is a foundational pillar of any thriving society, and its stability should be a top priority. I believe in a balanced approach of personal responsibility and limited government intervention to address issues like poverty. Furthermore, traditions and values that have served us well for centuries should not be discarded without serious consideration."
"The free market, bolstered by minimal government intervention, is the cornerstone of economic prosperity. High tax rates and excessive regulations stifle innovation and hinder job growth. In order to foster a robust economy, we must champion individual enterprise, fiscal responsibility, and balanced budgets."
"Rather than seeing the presence of religious symbolism in public spaces as a breach of separation of church and state, I view it as a testament to the rich tapestry of faiths and beliefs that have played a crucial role in shaping our nation's history. Additionally, I firmly believe that the protection of religious liberty and the freedom of conscience is fundamental, and must be upheld for individuals of all faiths or no faith at all. After all, we pride ourselves on being a nation that champions freedom, including the freedom to believe."
"The heavy reliance on foreign oil, particularly from politically unstable regions, poses a concerning threat to our national security and economy. We should actively support policies that encourage domestic energy production, including the responsible use of our abundant natural resources such as natural gas and oil. This not only bolsters our economic stability, but also strengthens our national defense by reducing our dependency on foreign entities."
"I firmly believe in the importance and value of traditional family structures in shaping a healthy society. Regarding the roles of gender, I think it's crucial to respect and uphold the inherent differences that make men and women unique, rather than attempting to erase these distinctions. However, this should not limit individual freedom and choice within these structures."
"I believe that it's crucial to strike a balance between our economic growth and environmental conservation. While it is important to tap into our natural resources for job creation and energy needs, we must also ensure that this is done responsibly to safeguard our environment for future generations. Guided by scientific evidence, we should advocate for practical, market-based solutions to address environmental challenges."
"I firmly believe in the preservation of traditional family values as they serve as the backbone of our society.

"I firmly believe in the sanctity and traditional structure of the family unit as a cornerstone of our society. It provides a stable environment for raising children and fosters values that contribute to a prosperous nation. On the subject of gender, I argue for the preservation and respect of biological distinctions, as they hold evolutionary and social significance."
"The importance of individual freedom and limited government interference are fundamental values that should be applied to our education system. Rather than centralized mandates and standardized tests, parents should have the ability to choose the kind of education that best fits their child's needs. This can be achieved through initiatives like school vouchers, charter schools, and homeschooling options."
"I believe that free market capitalism fosters economic growth, innovation, and prosperity more effectively than any other economic system. It is essential to cherish and protect individual rights and freedoms, including the right to own property and conduct business. It's also important to maintain reasonable regulations to prevent abuse, but overregulation can hinder economic success and individual liberty."

Government intervention should be kept minimal in economic affairs, permitting market forces to drive growth and innovation. Furthermore, safeguarding individual rights and liberties should be prioritized to ensure a free society."
"I firmly believe that the concept of equality and justice should extend to all individuals, regardless of their race. Our focus should not be on perpetuating racial division, but on promoting unity and shared values. Additionally, we must emphasize individual responsibility and hard work as key to success, rather than attributing disparities solely to systemic issues."
"One of the keystones of a healthy society is a solid, traditional family structure. I firmly believe that children benefit most from being raised in a stable environment with both a mother and a father. On matters related to gender, it's important to acknowledge and respect the biological differences that exist, while ensuring both genders have equal opportunities to thrive."
"I firmly believe in the importance of personal freedom and individual responsibility. Government intervention should be limited and should primarily focus on maintaining law and order, national security, and providing essential public services. The economy should be left to the free market, enabling businesses to compete and grow without excessive regulation."
"While it's crucial to be good stewards of the environment, it's equally important to ensure that the regulation does not stifle economic growth or individual freedoms. I believe that innovative technology and private sector initiative can play a significant role in protecting our environment without the need for excessive government intervention. We must balance our goal of reducing emissions, for example, with the necessity of affordable energy for all American households and businesses."
"In my perspective, religious liberty, a bedrock foundation of our nation, must be preserved and protected. This includes the rights of individuals, businesses, and organizations to practice their faith without government intrusion or coercion. Equally important is the belief that our public policies should respect and accommodate religious convictions, including those that may conflict with contemporary societal trends."
"While it's admirable to strive for an egalitarian society, it's important to understand that wealth is often a product of hard work, innovation, and risk-taking. Imposing high tax rates on the successful can stifle economic growth and disincentivize entrepreneurship. A free-market economy, where everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed, fosters competitiveness, innovation, and efficiency."
"I thoroughly believe in the significance of individual freedom and limited governmental intervention. The importance of personal responsibility, free markets, and strong national defense are key foundations to ensure a thriving society. Additionally, maintaining traditional values and norms, I feel, plays a crucial role in preserving the fabric of our society."
"I believe in the intrinsic value of the traditional family structure as a cornerstone of society, promoting stability, character formation, and personal responsibility. Furthermore, I hold a deep respect for the rights of individuals and their property, and propose that free-market competition is often a more efficient solution than state interference. This respect extends to the conviction that the fruits of one's labor should be minimally taxed, encouraging ambition and personal prosperity."
"I believe that each individual should take responsibility for their own life choices and circumstances. Society should encourage self-reliance and hard work instead of promoting a culture of entitlement. Moreover, traditional values and norms play a significant role in maintaining social order and should be respected."
"I believe it is fundamental to uphold and respect the constitution that our founding fathers worked tirelessly to construct. On the issue of gun control, I stand firm in the belief that our second amendment rights should not be infringed. Responsible ownership and usage of firearms is a liberty that is deeply rooted in our nation's history and is vital for the protection and security of our citizens."
"While it's understandable that international cooperation is necessary in today's interconnected world, it's essential to prioritize our national interests. The concept of national sovereignty should not be undermined in the process of globalization. Policies must be directed to protect domestic industries and to maintain the cultural integrity of our nation."
"I believe that instead of focusing on dividing people along racial lines, we should emphasize the unity and shared values that we have as citizens of the same nation. Rather than promoting policies that give special privileges to specific racial groups, we should strive for equal opportunities for all, regardless of race or ethnic background. Individual merits, capabilities, and efforts should be the criteria for success in our society."
"As a firm believer in individual rights and responsibilities, I hold that the issue of healthcare should be predominantly a private matter. The free market encourages competition and innovation, leading to better quality and efficiency in healthcare services. It is crucial to place our trust in personal choices and values rather than in a one-size-fits-all government-led approach."
"I firmly believe that the best way to uplift our society is to foster a culture of personal responsibility and self-reliance. In terms of healthcare, this would entail encouraging citizens to take a more active role in their wellness, rather than over-relying on government assistance. As for education, I am a strong advocate for school choice, as I believe it places the power of decision-making in the hands of parents, leading to higher quality education for all children."
"In light of the ongoing debates about taxation, I firmly believe in the importance of incentivizing entrepreneurship and hard work through tax relief. Excessive taxation on high earners could stifle innovation and lead to economic stagnation. A fair and balanced tax system, that promotes economic growth and prosperity while also ensuring that everyone contributes their fair share, should be the goal for our nation."
"Ensuring a strong national defense and investing in our military should be a top priority. Lower taxes and fewer regulations can incentivize businesses, leading to economic growth and prosperity.

"I firmly believe in the power of free markets and individual liberty to drive economic prosperity. I see an overreaching government as a hindrance rather than a help to prosperity, creating unnecessary barriers and regulations for businesses. Sound fiscal policy, lower taxes, and minimal regulation are the keys to fostering economic growth and stability."
"While I absolutely respect the importance of a clean and healthy environment, I believe it's critical to ensure that environmental regulations do not hinder economic growth and business development. We must strike a balance between protecting our natural resources and maintaining a thriving economy. It's possible to have both, if we encourage innovation and responsible practices within industries."
"The current trend towards globalist policies threatens the sovereignty of nations. While international cooperation is important, it should never come at the cost of a nation's ability to govern itself and protect its own interests. It is vital that we prioritize domestic growth and stability before extending our resources and commitments globally."
"I believe that the focus should be on creating equal opportunity for all individuals, regardless of their racial or ethnic background. It is essential to acknowledge that everyone has the potential to succeed, given the right resources and circumstances. We should strive for a society where character, merit, and hard work are the cornerstones of success, and not factors that are out of one's control."
"The backbone of our society, in many ways, is the traditional family structure, which serves as a reliable support system for the growth and prosperity of individuals and communities.

I uphold the belief that people should be allowed to keep more of what they earn, encouraging economic growth and prosperity. On social issues, like marriage and family values, I believe in upholding traditional norms and cultural continuity."
I firmly believe in the fundamental importance of family values and traditions in society.

"I believe that the traditional family structure, with a mother and father working in partnership, provides a stable and nurturing environment for the growth and development of children. I also uphold the view that biological distinctions between males and females are natural and significant, shaping our individual identities and roles in society. This doesn't discount the importance of equal opportunities for all, regardless of gender."
"While I appreciate the underlying motivations behind the push for universal healthcare, I believe a market-based approach can deliver better results. Competition encourages innovation and efficiency in healthcare, potentially leading to improved services and lowered costs. Our focus should be on fostering a competitive environment, not eliminating it."
"Ensuring a thriving economy requires fostering an environment that promotes free enterprise and entrepreneurship. Over-regulation and excessive taxation can stifle business growth and innovation.

"While it is pivotal that we respect and protect our environment, it is equally important to balance this with the needs of our economy and industry. Sustainable practices shouldn't hinder progress and growth, but work in tandem with them. Each proposed environmental policy should be judiciously evaluated for its potential impact on job creation and economic prosperity."
"I believe in the power of the free market and individual enterprise in driving economic prosperity. Over-regulation can stifle innovation and hinder businesses from reaching their full potential. It is vital that we ensure a climate conducive to entrepreneurial success, which, in turn, can foster job creation and a robust economy."
"I firmly believe that the foundation of our educational system should be rooted in providing students the skills and knowledge necessary to build a prosperous future, rather than promoting any particular ideology. It's important to promote a learning environment that encourages critical thinking and intellectual diversity, as opposed to stifling discussion or dissenting viewpoints. Above all, we must ensure that the decisions about curriculum and school policies are made at the community level, where parents and local educators have the greatest understanding of their students' needs."
"It's concerning to see the lack of responsibility taken by nations to become energy independent. Relying heavily on other countries for resources, especially energy resources, undermines national security and the economy. A better strategy would be encouraging domestic production and advancing technology to reduce dependency and bolster self-sufficiency."
"The key to a prosperous society is a market economy where individuals and businesses have the freedom to formulate their economic choices and decisions.

It's crucial to strike a balance between our responsibilities towards the environment and the practical needs of our industries and workforce. Solutions should not only be sustainable for the environment but also for the American economy."
"In regard to religious freedom, I firmly believe in the foundational principle that every individual should be allowed to practice faith, or choose not to, without interference from the government. These liberties are ingrained in our Constitution and should be respected and protected. Furthermore, faith-based institutions should maintain their rights to operate in accordance with their deeply-held beliefs without undue pressure or regulation from government entities."
"I strongly believe in the importance of maintaining our constitutional rights, particularly the Second Amendment. It is essential to preserve the right of law-abiding citizens to bear arms for their protection and for the security of a free state. Moreover, I advocate for a limited, efficient government that promotes individual liberty and personal responsibility."
"While many argue for higher corporate taxes and aggressive wealth redistribution to address economic disparity, I strongly believe in the power of free market capitalism. It encourages competition, rewards hard work and innovation, and has been historically successful in creating wealth and prosperity. The focus should be on creating an economic environment where everyone has the opportunity to succeed, rather than penalizing success."
"While it's undeniable that we must treat our environment with respect and aim for sustainability, we cannot ignore the potential economic repercussions of certain environmental policies. It is vital we find a balanced approach that encourages responsible business practices, promotes innovation, and sustains economic growth. After all, a prosperous economy can often provide the necessary resources to develop cleaner technologies and to protect our natural world."
"I firmly believe in the importance of a market-driven economy where competition fosters innovation, growth, and individual prosperity. The role of government should be limited, only stepping in to protect citizens' rights and liberties, rather than dictating economic outcomes. On issues such as healthcare and education, I advocate for more choice and less central control."
"I believe that it's essential to focus on the individual, their character, and their achievements, rather than their race. The goal should be a society where all individuals have the opportunity to reach their full potential, irrespective of their racial background. Fixating on race often diverts us from the real issues that need to be addressed, such as economic inequality and access to quality education."
"While I wholeheartedly believe in equality and respect for all individuals, I also believe that the emphasis should be on a merit-based system, rather than racial quotas.

It's my belief that the government should interfere less in the economy, allowing the free market to adjust itself and stimulate growth. We need to prioritize individual responsibility and self-determination, limiting government intervention and promoting personal freedoms."
"The notion of raising the federal minimum wage may seem tempting to some, but it's essential to consider the potential ramifications on small businesses. These businesses, which form the backbone of our economy, often operate on thin margins and could be forced to cut back on hiring or even let employees go to comply with such mandates. A balanced approach to these issues is necessary; one which encourages fair compensation while also fostering a conducive environment for business growth and job creation."
"The freedom to practice one's religion without interference or prejudice is a fundamental right that should be respected. It is essential to acknowledge the significance of faith in the lives of countless individuals and its role in forming moral and ethical values. However, it is equally imperative that the practice of one's religion does not infringe upon the rights and freedoms of others."
"The health of our economy is intrinsically tied to the empowerment of the individual. I believe in fostering a business climate that encourages entrepreneurship and innovation, not one bogged down by excessive regulations and high taxation. Responsible fiscal policy should prioritize the reduction of public debt and the promotion of economic freedom, enabling each citizen to strive for their version of the American Dream."
"The issue of energy independence is one that we should prioritize. It strengthens our national security by reducing our dependence on unstable foreign nations and promotes economic growth through job creation within the energy sector.

"As a believer in the sanctity of individual liberties, I feel it is paramount to protect the right of every person to practice their faith freely, without governmental interference or coercion. I also believe that it's vital to maintain the separation of church and state, ensuring that neither exerts undue influence over the other. However, I respect the historical and moral compass religion provides in society and consider it a crucial fabric in our cultural mosaic."
"While it's clear that human activity has an impact on the environment, a knee-jerk reaction that inhibits economic growth is not the solution. We should certainly be innovative and strive for sustainability, but not at the cost of crippling our industries and job market. A balanced approach, where economic viability and environmental responsibility coexist, should be our goal."
"While it's crucial to have safeguards in place for those truly in need, an overreliance on welfare programs can often result in decreased motivation for self-improvement and economic mobility. Further, an overtaxed economy can stifle business growth and innovation. Therefore, it's essential to strike a balance between compassionate assistance and encouraging individual responsibility."
"I firmly believe in the importance of upholding traditional family values as the fundamental unit of our society. Also, I hold the perspective that there needs to be a greater emphasis on personal responsibility and less reliance on government assistance, to promote self-reliance and individual achievement.

The nurturing environment it provides is critical for the emotional and psychological development of children. On gender issues, I advocate for equal opportunities and rights for all, while maintaining respect for biological differences and their implications."
"While I advocate for maintaining the integrity of our country's borders, I also believe in the American dream as a shining beacon for those seeking a better life. Our immigration system needs comprehensive reform that ensures both security and opportunity. I also believe that justice should be colorblind, valuing the content of one’s character above all, and that we should strive to eliminate any systemic biases in our institutions."
"While it's crucial to offer a supportive structure for those in need, I believe government welfare programs should be designed with a focus on instilling self-sufficiency, rather than dependence. We should promote policies that create opportunities for individuals to rise, fostering a culture of personal responsibility and hard work. Ultimately, the best path towards a prosperous society is through individual initiative and enterprise, supported by a free-market economy."
"While it's understandable that people desire a higher minimum wage, it's important to consider the potential negative impact on small businesses. These enterprises, which are the backbone of our economy, may struggle to meet such obligations, which could lead to layoffs or even closures. It's necessary to balance the desire for enhanced worker pay with practicalities of business survival and job creation."
"While I believe in progressive taxation, I also think it's critical to avoid overburdening corporations and the wealthy with excessive tax rates. High taxes can stifle growth, innovation, and job creation. It's important to strike a balance that supports both social programs and economic prosperity."
"I believe that the institution of family, traditionally understood as a unit composed of a mother, a father and children, is fundamental to the health and stability of our society. It provides a natural structure for nurturing and educating our future generations. Regarding gender, I uphold the value of both men and women, and believe their unique and complementary roles contribute significantly to the harmony and balance of society."

The focus should be on promoting equality of opportunity, not equality of outcome, in our pursuit of a just society. We must strive to address racial disparities where they exist, but in a manner that fosters individual responsibility and self-reliance."
"I believe that all individuals should be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their race or ethnic background. We should focus on empowering everyone to achieve their potential through hard work, personal responsibility, and equal opportunity. The emphasis should be on an individual's character and capabilities, rather than their race, as a defining factor for success in our society."
"While I absolutely agree that we need to safeguard our environment, I believe that it's crucial to balance environmental protection with economic growth. Over-regulation could potentially stifle innovation and harm small businesses. A free market approach, encouraging green technology and renewable energy through incentives, could be a more effective and sustainable solution."

It is essential to preserve the separation of church and state, as it is a cornerstone of our democracy that safeguards our liberty.

"I firmly believe in the importance of individual liberty and personal responsibility in guiding our choices. As such, I find it necessary to advocate for limited government intervention in the economy, thereby allowing free markets to operate more efficiently. A strong national defense is also key to ensuring our nation's continued safety and prosperity."
"When it comes to religious freedom, it is imperative that we respect and uphold the First Amendment rights of all United States citizens.

It also means respecting the space of those who choose to live life without religious affiliation."
"I firmly believe in the principle of equal opportunity for all, irrespective of race, creed, or color. Nobody should be either favored or discriminated against based on their racial or ethnic background. Merit and character, above all else, should be the cornerstones in determining an individual's opportunities and achievements."
"Our nation's strength is predicated on the recognition and support of sovereign nations, democratic ideals and free market economies. Regarding the Iran nuclear deal, it's vital we uphold a policy that effectively deters nuclear proliferation, instead of enabling regimes with a history of hostility towards the U.S. and our allies.

"While it's crucial for individuals to have access to necessary resources, a balance must be maintained to prevent dependency on government support. Encouraging self-reliance and fostering entrepreneurship should be at the heart of any economic policy. This approach not only stimulates economic growth but also promotes personal responsibility and individual freedom."
"As someone who values the traditional family structure, I believe that children thrive best in stable, two-parent households where both a mother and a father are present.

While all individuals deserve respect and dignity, redefining the fundamental understanding of male and female could lead to societal confusion and potential harm."
"I firmly believe in the principle of religious liberty, which grants every individual the freedom to practice their faith without interference or oppression. It's vital that this right is respected and safeguarded as it forms a crucial part of a person's identity. Too often, we see infringement on these rights and it is important for societies worldwide to take steps in preventing such transgressions."
"The sanctity of family life is paramount, and I believe that it's critical to maintain traditional family values as the foundation of our society. In terms of gender, I am an advocate for equal opportunities and rights, but I also think it's crucial to preserve the distinction between sexes, as there are inherent biological and societal differences. These differences are not meant to divide but to harmonize the co-existence of genders in society."
"I strongly believe in the First Amendment and the right to religious freedom it grants to every American. This also means respecting the place of religion or lack thereof in our public square and in our schools. However, I am cautious of any initiative or policy that could potentially infringe upon the rights of religious institutions and individuals to freely practice and express their faith, as these rights are foundational to our nation's principles."
"I believe in the fundamental value and dignity of all individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity. Issues related to race should be approached with respect and fairness, aiming towards equal opportunity for everyone. It's essential that we uphold the principles of meritocracy, where people are recognized and rewarded based on their abilities and achievements, rather than their racial or ethnic backgrounds."
"I believe in the principle of national sovereignty and I am deeply concerned about global institutions undermining this.

My stance is that international relationships should be guided by mutual respect for these sovereignties and not by forced assimilation or overarching regulations."
"I believe firmly in the preservation of traditional family values and structures as they have proven to provide a solid foundation for raising well-rounded children. Moreover, I believe gender is not a social construct but a biological reality. These two principles guide my perspective when it comes to policymaking and societal norms."
"I firmly believe that all individuals, regardless of their race or background, should be offered the same opportunities and be judged by their character and capabilities rather than their ethnicity. It is crucial to foster a society where merit is the determining factor for success. It's important to remember that unity and mutual respect are what truly make a nation strong."
"As a firm believer in the traditional family unit, I hold that it serves as the bedrock of our society. I believe that the institution of marriage should be between one man and one woman. Furthermore, I am convinced that it is essential for children to have both maternal and paternal influences in their lives for balanced growth and development."

Striking a balance between environmental protection and economic growth is crucial. It's also important to encourage innovation and technological advancements that will lead to cleaner, more sustainable industries."
"When it comes to the education system, I firmly believe in an approach that prioritizes parental choice and local control. The one-size-fits-all model propagated by the federal government neglects the unique needs and values of various communities. Therefore, empowering parents and local school boards to make decisions on curriculum and school policies ensures a more relevant and effective education for our children."
"While I'm all for protecting our natural resources, I also believe in the importance of economic development and growth. We can't hinder industries and compromise jobs in the name of environmental protection.

Raising taxes doesn't necessarily solve our budget issues, it's more about controlling the spending and prioritizing the allocation of funds. The role of government should be minimized, allowing for the private sector and individual citizens to make decisions that best suit their needs."
"The Iran nuclear deal, as it stands, appears to offer limited assurance in ensuring global security. It is imperative that we take a harder stance on negotiations to mitigate the potential threat that nuclear proliferation poses. America must assert its leadership in enforcing stricter sanctions and secure a more comprehensive, long-term agreement that genuinely guarantees Iran's nuclear disarmament."
"I firmly believe in the importance of traditional family structures and values, as I consider them the backbone of a healthy society.

Any policy change should be careful to maintain this harmony."
"I firmly believe in the fundamental right to religious freedom, as highlighted in the Constitution, and the crucial role it plays in defining the diverse tapestry of American society.

We should prioritize market-based solutions and innovations to address environmental challenges rather than heavy-handed regulation. Sustainable development can be genuinely achieved when economic prosperity goes hand in hand with environmental stewardship."
"I firmly believe in the power of free markets to drive economic growth and innovation. The private sector, unhindered by excessive governmental regulation, has the potential to create wealth, jobs, and prosperity.

Crucially, it is imperative that the state refrains from promoting any particular religion, ensuring a fair and equal society for all."
"Balancing the budget should be a top priority, even when it comes to education. While it's crucial that we invest in our students and teachers, we must not do it at the expense of fiscal responsibility. Our country's future isn't just in the classroom, but also in our ability to maintain a thriving and sustainable economy."

"When it comes to the issue of immigration, I believe there is a necessity to maintain our country's security and economic stability. Although I fully support the principle of providing a safe haven for those who are genuinely fleeing persecution and violence, it is equally critical to ensure we have stringent processes in place.

"I firmly believe in the institution of traditional family values, understanding it as the cornerstone of a robust, enduring society. I also uphold the biological distinction between genders, stressing the importance of respecting and cherishing these differences. It's crucial to consider these views when shaping policies that address family and gender issues."

Our society thrives on a healthy balance of progress and preservation of time-honored beliefs and practices.

It is essential to maintain minimal governmental intervention in the economy to allow for competitive markets, which ultimately lead to innovation, efficiency, and job creation."
"When it comes to family values, I believe that a strong, stable family unit is the foundation of a great society.

Equally important is the role of parents, who ought to take the lead in guiding and educating their children, ensuring they grow up to be responsible and contributing members of society."
"I believe in the importance of limited government intervention in the economy, allowing individuals and businesses to thrive through free-market competition. I also think it's essential to uphold traditional values and principles that have been the backbone of our society. Strong national defense and individual liberty are key pillars to maintaining a prosperous and secure nation."
"I believe in the importance of preserving traditional family values, as they offer a solid foundation for society, promoting strong moral character and ethics. The role of both a father and a mother in the upbringing of children cannot be overstated, as each brings unique qualities and perspectives to parenting. Regarding gender, I hold the view that biological differences between men and women are real and significant, and these differences should be acknowledged and respected, rather than blurred or negated."
"I firmly believe in the importance of individual liberties and limited government intervention in our daily lives.

"While I firmly believe in the importance of safeguarding our environment for future generations, I also contend that economic growth and environmental conservation need not be mutually exclusive.

This includes the conviction that individuals and businesses thrive best under minimal government regulation. Furthermore, I advocate for fiscal responsibility, which entails balanced budgets and reduced public debt."

"The traditional family structure, with two parents and children, has been an integral part of our society for generations. It provides a balanced environment for the growth and development of children. Likewise, the notion of gender is not arbitrary or insignificant; it is deeply rooted in biology and influences an individual's experiences and challenges in life."
"As a strong advocate for individual responsibility and limited government oversight, I firmly believe in the critical role of school choice in education reform. Students and parents should have the autonomy to choose the educational pathway that best suits their unique needs and aspirations, rather than being confined by the constraints of their geographic location. By allowing market dynamics to play a role in the education sector, we can foster a more competitive, innovative, and effective learning environment for all."
"I believe it's crucial for us to focus on maintaining strong national defense and prioritize our national interests. While international cooperation has its place, we should not compromise on our sovereignty. The protection of our borders, industries, and values should remain at the forefront of our policy-making decisions."
"While I believe in the importance of preserving our natural resources for future generations, it's critical that we approach environmental regulations with a measured, balanced perspective.

Hence, any environmental policy should be designed to protect the environment without stifering innovation and business competitiveness."
"I believe in the fundamental importance of the family unit as the bedrock of society, and I feel it's crucial to support policies that strengthen its stability. Furthermore, our nation's fiscal health and the economic opportunities available to its citizens are of paramount importance. Therefore, I advocate for strategies that promote economic growth and minimize governmental interference in the free market."
"While I firmly believe in the importance of protecting our natural resources, I also recognize that any environmental regulations must balance sustainability with economic viability. It's crucial to support technological innovations and market-based solutions that can help reduce pollution and manage resources efficiently, without stifering economic growth. The key is to pursue environmental conservation in ways that respect property rights and encourage individual responsibility."
"While I believe it is important to protect and preserve our natural environment, I also affirm that economic growth and environmental conservation are not mutually exclusive.

"It's fundamentally crucial to encourage entrepreneurship and fiscal responsibility, as these are the primary drivers of economic growth and prosperity. By reducing regulatory burdens and maintaining low taxes, we allow businesses - both small and large - to thrive and create jobs. It's not expansive government, but free-market competition that fuels innovation and provides opportunities for all."
"In light of current debates about religious liberties, I firmly believe that it is crucial to respect and uphold the First Amendment rights of all U.S. citizens to freely exercise their faith without infringement.

Furthermore, on the topic of racial justice, I advocate for equal opportunity for all citizens, emphasizing the importance of personal responsibility and the value of hard work over government reliance."
"The private sector, if left to its own devices, is typically the most efficient driver of economic prosperity. High levels of government regulation and excessive taxation can stifle entrepreneurial spirits and hinder the growth of small businesses. A free-market economy promotes competition and innovation, resulting in better quality goods and services for all."
"All individuals, regardless of their racial or ethnic background, should be acknowledged and respected for their personal merits and contributions. I believe in a society that emphasizes individual character and hard work over racial identity. This perspective doesn't suggest turning a blind eye to inequality, rather it supports addressing these issues without dividing individuals along racial lines."
"While I acknowledge the necessity for comprehensive immigration reform, I believe it should be done in a manner that respects our existing laws and prioritizes national security. With regard to racial justice, I firmly believe that everyone should be treated equally under the law, regardless of their race or ethnicity. It's imperative that our institutions reflect this principle in practice, but we must also safeguard against policies that may inadvertently fuel division or undermine individual responsibility."

On the topic of gun ownership, it is essential to uphold the Second Amendment, as it safeguards citizens' ability to protect themselves and their property. However, I also understand the need for responsible and sensible regulations to prevent misuse and ensure public safety."
"I firmly believe in the sanctity and traditional structure of the family as bedrocks of a stable society. I also affirm that each individual, regardless of gender, should have equal rights and opportunities, but I don't support efforts to blur or erase distinctions between sexes. These distinctions, grounded in biology and tradition, play important roles in the functioning of a healthy society."
"As we contemplate our nation's involvement in the Middle East, it is imperative to prioritize the safety and interests of the American people above all else. The past has shown us that nation-building efforts often stumble, resulting in costly and prolonged military engagements abroad. Instead of expending resources in indefinite overseas commitments, we should strengthen our borders, bolster our defenses, and ensure our domestic security."
"I firmly believe that the traditional family structure, with a mother and a father, is the bedrock of our society and has proven to be the most effective environment for raising well-adjusted children. Concerning gender, I am of the view that it is biologically determined and not a social construct. It is crucial to protect the integrity of these institutions for the overall wellbeing of our society."
"While I recognize the importance of maintaining a safety net for our most vulnerable citizens, I believe in the principle of personal responsibility and the power of individual initiative in shaping one's future. The focus of welfare programs should be to provide temporary assistance while empowering individuals to become self-sufficient. On the issue of education, I believe in fostering competition and choice in order to improve the quality of education our children receive, rather than continually increasing funding for failing public schools."
"As a strong advocate for individual liberties and limited government interference, I firmly believe that the free market economy is the best instrument for prosperity and growth. This perspective makes me particularly skeptical about proposals of universal healthcare, which despite good intentions, may risk undermining the efficiency and quality of healthcare services. Additionally, I'm concerned about how such broad-ranging government initiatives will be financed, considering that it may lead to increased taxation or national debt."
"The concept of raising the minimum wage may seem attractive at first glance, but it may potentially lead to job loss and increased costs for small businesses. Instead, market forces should be allowed to dictate wages to ensure economic competition and drive innovation. The focus should be on equipping individuals with the necessary skills to command higher wages, not government mandates."
"While I fully support the goal of preserving our planet for future generations, it's important to consider the economic implications of drastic environmental regulations. The goal should be to strive for balance, promoting sustainable practices that also support economic growth and job creation. Over-regulation can stifle innovation and entrepreneurship, which are fundamental to our economy and prosperity."
"While it's undeniable that racial inequalities exist, I believe the best path forward is to foster opportunities for all Americans, irrespective of their race or ethnicity.

This way, we can build a society based on merit and individual achievement, instead of perpetuating divisions by race."
"While it's critical to uphold the ideals of compassion and humanity, I believe that it's equally important to enforce our immigration laws. A robust, legally-complied immigration system not only respects the law but also ensures national security and economic stability.

"The notion of raising the minimum wage, while well-intentioned, may trigger unintended consequences such as job losses and increased automation. Small businesses, in particular, could be crippled by such a change, potentially leading to a surge in unemployment. We need to focus on policies that stimulate job growth, not hinder it."
"I firmly believe in the importance of judging individuals based on their character, actions, and achievements, rather than their racial or ethnic background.

We should strive to uphold the principles of equality and fairness, where everyone is given the chance to succeed."
"I strongly believe in the importance of small government, placing trust in the individual to make decisions that best serve their own interests.

Additionally, it is paramount to maintain a strong national defense to protect our borders and citizens."
"While it's essential to protect and preserve our environment for future generations, we must also consider the economic implications of environmental regulations. Policies such as the Green New Deal, while well-intentioned, could have debilitating effects on our economy and potentially damage the job market. Therefore, it's crucial to strike a balance between environmental responsibility and economic growth."
"The Iranian Nuclear Deal has been a subject of contention for many years now. Contrary to the belief that it will successfully prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, I believe it provides far too much leniency and opportunity for breach. The deal, in its current form, seems to lack robust enforcement mechanisms, thereby, potentially enabling Iran to continue their nuclear activities under the veil of compliance."
"While I firmly believe in the importance of preserving the rights and dignity of all individuals, I am concerned about the potential implications of unchecked immigration. It's essential that we have a system in place that prioritizes national security, economic stability, and the rule of law.

"I believe firmly in the power and potential of every individual, regardless of their background. That being said, it's crucial to uphold the rule of law, and that includes immigration policy. While pursuing a compassionate and understanding approach towards those seeking a better life, we must also ensure the integrity and safety of our nation through careful, consistent enforcement of our laws."
"I firmly believe in the importance of personal freedom and responsibility when it comes to healthcare. In my view, a competitive, free-market healthcare system would not only promote innovation but also improve the quality of services, making them more affordable and accessible to all.

However, it is vital to remember that sustainability and economic growth are not mutually exclusive. We should seek solutions that encourage innovation and market competition, rather than relying on heavy-handed government regulations that could stifle our economic progress and individual freedoms."
"In the sphere of religious freedom, it is my strong belief that every individual has the unalienable right to practice their faith freely without interference from the government.

It is imperative that we work towards a society where everyone, regardless of their racial background, has an equal opportunity to succeed based on their skills and abilities."
"I strongly believe in the foundational role of religion in fostering moral values within our society. I respect and advocate for the freedom of religious expression, as it is a fundamental right enshrined in our constitution. However, I also uphold the importance of maintaining a clear separation between church and state to ensure that no single religious group dominates over others."
"Strong national borders are not just essential for maintaining sovereignty but also for the protection of citizen's safety and economic stability. It is pivotal to enforce a fair and robust immigration policy that respects the law and encourages skilled immigrants who can contribute positively to our economy. Furthermore, it's critical to maintain a balanced foreign policy, ensuring national interests are protected, while fostering peaceful and prosperous relationships with other nations."
"I firmly believe in the sanctity of traditional family values, emphasizing the pivotal role they play in shaping a healthier society.

These beliefs, however, should not detract from the significance of individual freedom and personal choice, as both coexist in a vibrant and thriving society."
"I believe that our education system should prioritize instilling fundamental knowledge, critical thinking, and personal responsibility in our students.

"While acknowledging the need for a comprehensive healthcare structure, I firmly believe that it should not be at the expense of individual freedom and free-market competition.

These perspectives are rooted in my conviction that a smaller government ensures the preservation of personal liberty and promotes economic prosperity."
"Our nation must prioritize its own interests first and foremost, ensuring a robust economy and security before extending aid overseas. It's of great importance to understand that international cooperation, while valuable, should not compromise our sovereignty or our citizens' wellbeing. Furthermore, while diplomatic resolutions are always preferable, our nation should not hesitate to employ military force if it is necessary to safeguard our national security."
"I firmly believe in the importance of a stable family unit for a healthy and thriving society. Traditional roles within the family, while they may not suit everyone, have proven effective over generations in providing a balanced environment for raising children. Additionally, it's crucial to respect biological differences between genders, while also recognizing and supporting the equal value and rights of both men and women."
"I believe in the importance of preserving our natural resources and maintaining a clean environment, but it's equally vital to approach environmental regulations in a way that doesn't hinder economic growth. We should strive for sustainable practices that co-exist with industrial progress, acknowledging that technological advancements can also drive environmentally friendly solutions. The free market, in tandem with responsible government oversight, can lead us towards a balanced and prosperous future."

It is more beneficial in the long run to equip individuals with the skills and opportunities they need to achieve self-reliance."
"I firmly believe in the traditional family structure and its core values that have been the cornerstone of our society for centuries. It's crucial to respect the sanctity of marriage as a union between a man and a woman, for the purpose of raising children in a stable and nurturing environment. These tenets provide a framework for moral development and societal continuity."
"While I understand and respect the merits of public education, I fervently believe in the importance of school choice, including access to charter schools and private institutions. This empowers parents and students, fostering an environment where the competition fosters improved results and innovation across the board. The one-size-fits-all approach to education fails to account for the diverse needs and talents of our youth, and it's crucial we embrace systems that encourage diversity and individual growth."
"I firmly believe in the sanctity of religious freedom and the right for all individuals to practice their faith without interference from the government. The First Amendment guarantees us this liberty and it is fundamental to the very fabric of our nation. However, it is also crucial that we ensure this freedom does not infringe upon the rights and liberties of others."
"I firmly believe in the importance of maintaining national sovereignty and upholding the integrity of borders amidst global pressures.

"I believe in the power of free markets and individual enterprise to drive economic growth and prosperity. It's crucial that we maintain an environment where businesses can thrive, innovate and compete without unnecessary government interference. This includes keeping taxes low and removing excessive regulations, as they can often act as significant barriers to success for businesses and entrepreneurs."
"While it's undeniably important to protect our planet and conserve its resources, it is equally important to ensure that our environmental policies do not impede economic growth and prosperity. We should encourage industries to adopt greener practices, but the transition must be gradual to prevent massive job loss. It's essential to strike a balance between environmental responsibility and fiscal prudence."

"In addressing the issue of healthcare, I firmly believe in the principle of individual responsibility and free-market competition.

"Maintaining our environment's health is undeniably vital, and it's crucial that we approach this issue responsibly and pragmatically. Solutions that foster economic growth and technological advancements can prove to be more sustainable in the long run.

Lower taxes and deregulation not only fuel entrepreneurial spirit, but also create jobs and opportunities for all. Moreover, individual responsibility and fiscal prudence are crucial for a well-functioning society."
"While I believe in the significance of preserving our environment for future generations, I am also a strong advocate for economic growth and stability. Responsibility lies in striking a balance between environmental conservation efforts and the continued prosperity of our industries. We should explore sustainable practices that allow us to do both, rather than imposing prohibitive regulations that stifle economic opportunity."
"I firmly believe in upholding the freedom of religious expression as it is a fundamental right embedded in our constitution. However, it is crucial to strike a balance where this liberty does not infringe upon the rights of others or compromise the safety and security of our nation. It's imperative that we respect all ethical and moral boundaries while practicing our faiths."
"I believe firmly in preserving the traditional family structure, as I believe it serves as the backbone of our society. The roles of both men and women are equally important and complementary to each other, ensuring stability and continuity.

It's not a question of shutting doors, but rather opening them in a regulated, lawful manner."
"I firmly believe in the principles of limited government intervention, fiscal responsibility, and free market capitalism.

The role of the government should primarily be to uphold law and order, safeguard constitutional rights, and ensure a level playing field for all."
"As we examine the state of our education system, it's critical to consider the value of school choice.

The potential threats posed by unchecked immigration underscore the importance of having a stringent, yet fair immigration policy. International diplomacy should be approached with strength and assertiveness, but also with the understanding that fostering relationships with other nations is mutually beneficial."
"In my view, it is essential to uphold the principle of religious freedom, which is a cornerstone of our society.

At the same time, it's vital that we maintain a respectful dialogue between different belief systems to foster understanding and coexistence."

"I believe in the inherent dignity, equality, and inalienable rights of all members of the human family, regardless of their race or ethnicity. It's important that we focus on creating a society that provides equal opportunities for all, rather than emphasizing divisions. We must strive for unity and harmony, emphasizing shared values and common goals, rather than focusing on differences."
"While it's crucial to ensure that all citizens have the opportunity to thrive, I believe heavily in the importance of free-market principles. Governmental regulations, particularly in the business sector, often stifle innovation and hinder economic growth. It's important to remember that prosperity is more readily achieved when individuals and businesses are allowed to operate with minimal bureaucratic interference."
"The issue of national sovereignty should be upheld as a vital principle in international relations. One nation should not infrally upon the domestic affairs of another. It is critical to maintain a balance of power internationally to prevent any potential hegemony, and respect for each nation's right to self-determination should be a cornerstone of foreign policy."
I believe that religious freedom should be protected and respected at all levels of society. It's crucial for every individual to have the freedom to practice their faith without interference or persecution. We need to prioritize the acknowledgement and appreciation of religious diversity as an integral part of our national identity.
"On the matter of international trade, it's crucial that we prioritize the interests of American businesses and workers.

"On the topic of national security, I firmly believe in a robust defense policy.

It's crucial to prioritize our defense infrastructure and support the men and women who honorably serve in our military."
"When it comes to the matter of religious liberty, it is paramount to uphold the principle of freedom that our founding fathers set forth.

It is essential to maintain a fair and just society where every individual's belief system is respected and protected."
"Strong family units form the backbone of a thriving society. I believe in the significance of traditional family values, including the importance of marriage and the role of parents in raising children. In terms of gender, each has unique strengths, and respecting these differences can lead to a more balanced and productive society."
"When it comes to immigration, I believe that a country's security and economic stability are of utmost importance. While I wholeheartedly support humane and fair treatment for all, I also insist on the enforcement of our existing laws and regulations. Addressing racial justice, I advocate for policies that promote equal opportunity and condemn discrimination, but caution against measures that could inadvertently engender resentment or division."
"When considering immigration issues, it is crucial to emphasize the rule of law. Our nation's border integrity and sovereignty should not be compromised. While empathizing with those seeking a better life, we must not disregard the importance of legal processes in ensuring national security, economic stability, and the protection of American jobs."
"It's essential for us to respect and uphold the institution of marriage as a union between one man and one woman, as it has been the foundation of our society for generations. While we should treat all individuals with the respect they deserve, we must also protect the traditional values that contribute to a stable and prosperous society. Furthermore, it's important to emphasize the role of personal responsibility over reliance on government assistance in order to promote individual growth and independence."
"While it's clear that our nation was founded on principles of religious freedom and tolerance, I strongly believe that these rights should not be imposed upon or infringe on the rights of others. For instance, when it comes to the issue of religiously-based service refusals, we must ensure that the protection of religious freedom is balanced against the rights of individuals to access goods and services without discrimination. Ultimately, the harmony of our society depends on finding these careful balances and ensuring fairness for all."
"The foundation of our great nation lies in the rule of law and equal opportunities for all. The key to addressing the ongoing immigration issue is ensuring the enforcement of our immigration laws, while simultaneously providing a legal pathway for those who seek to contribute positively to our nation's development.

"While I fully respect an individual's autonomy in making decisions about their health, I believe it's crucial to safeguard the rights of the unborn, given that they do not have a voice to defend themselves.

This could be achieved through promoting school choice and charter schools, to ensure our children have the best chance to succeed according to their unique capabilities."
"I believe in the value, potential, and dignity of every individual, regardless of their racial background. It is of utmost importance to uphold the principle of equality of opportunity, where everyone, regardless of ethnicity, has the same chance to pursue their dreams and ambitions. Further, we must respect and encourage a diversity of viewpoints, cultures, and experiences, as they enrich our society and contribute to its vibrant character."
"The concept of limited government intervention is crucial for the prosperity of any nation. It not only fuels economic growth but also promotes individual liberty and personal responsibility. A thriving society is built on free markets, low taxes, and the ability of citizens to freely exercise their rights without overbearing governmental controls."
"In regards to health care, it's crucial to uphold the principles of individual liberty and free market capitalism. Instead of expanding government control, we should be looking at ways to increase competition, which inevitably lowers costs and improves quality. A one-size-fits-all approach is not the answer; choice and competition are."
"While I firmly acknowledge the importance of protecting our environment for future generations, I believe it's essential to approach environmental conservation in a way that also preserves economic growth and personal freedoms. Policies designed to limit environmental impact should be balanced, science-based, and avoid overburdening businesses and consumers. Additionally, I am a strong proponent of innovation and technological advancements as key solutions to reducing our carbon footprint and other environmental challenges."
"When it comes to the issue of school choice, I firmly believe that parents ought to have more control over where their children are educated. I value the idea of competition fostering excellence, and thus, competition among schools could potentially improve our education system overall. Moreover, allowing parents to choose their children's school would empower families to opt for educational environments that align more closely with their personal values and children's unique needs."
"It's my firm belief that we should uphold the sanctity of religious liberty, as guaranteed by the First Amendment. While it's important to foster a society that respects all viewpoints and beliefs, it's equally crucial that we avoid any governmental intrusions or regulations on religious practices. Our nation was founded on principles of freedom and individual rights, and these should be fiercely protected."
"The issue of global trade needs to be approached with prudence, taking into account the economic health of our own nation. Rather than embracing unchecked globalization, we should prioritize fair trade agreements that protect domestic industries and jobs.

"I deeply respect and uphold the principles of religious freedom that our great nation was founded upon. It is crucial that we preserve these tenets, allowing every individual the right to practice their faith without government interference. However, it is also essential that the exercise of religious freedom does not infringe upon others' rights, ensuring a balanced society where every individual is treated with dignity and respect."
"I firmly believe in the idea of limited government intervention, especially when it comes to healthcare.

"When it comes to the issue of religious freedom, it is my fundamental belief that every citizen should be allowed the full expression of their faith, as long as it does not infringe on the rights of others or violate the law.

"While I believe it's crucial to protect our environment and natural resources, it's essential to strike a balance that sustains economic growth and job creation. The issue of climate change, for instance, should be addressed, but it's equally important that we don't hinder industry or over-regulate in the process. We must find environmentally conscious solutions that respect free enterprise and individual liberty."
"When it comes to the topic of religious freedom, I firmly believe in the principle of upholding the right to practice one's beliefs without governmental intrusion. The founding fathers intended for there to be a clear separation of church and state, but not at the cost of suppressing religious expression in public or private spheres. Protecting this fundamental right will ensure the preservation of a diverse, tolerant, and truly free society."
"In my opinion, the traditional family unit, consisting of a father, a mother, and children, is the bedrock of a healthy society and fosters stable communities.

I firmly believe in promoting and preserving the values that encourage personal responsibility, commitment, and strong family ties."
"I believe that hard work and perseverance should determine an individual's access to success and prosperity. On the issue of public education, I lean towards supporting a system that rewards merit and achievement, rather than implementing blanket policies that don't account for individual effort or potential. I support healthcare strategies that preserve individual choice and competition, as they drive innovation and quality of care."

Every citizen should be able to live in accordance with their deeply held beliefs without fear of governmental intrusion or societal retaliation."
"While it's crucial to acknowledge and address our impact on the environment, we must balance this with the needs of our economy and job market.

"I firmly believe in the importance of individual liberty and personal responsibility.

These values, such as the sanctity of marriage, the significance of both maternal and paternal roles in child-rearing, and the advantages of a stable, cohesive family unit, play a crucial role in shaping generations and the future of our country. Moreover, it's crucial that we respect and acknowledge the inherent differences between the genders, as these differences contribute to our diversity and richness as a society."
"I firmly believe in the sanctity of the traditional family structure, with its core values serving as the foundation of our society. When it comes to gender-related issues, it is crucial that we respect biological realities and their implications, rather than being swayed by fluid concepts. These are important aspects to consider when we work towards policies that build a prosperous future for the generations to come."
"I firmly believe that reducing tax burdens and simplifying our tax code are essential to stimulate economic growth. Over-regulation and excessive taxation stifle business innovation, entrepreneurship, and free-market competition. As such, the government should take a step back, allowing the free market to flourish, leading to job creation and higher standards of living for everyone."
"While I firmly believe in the importance of environmental preservation, I also see the necessity of striking a balanced approach with economic growth. Strict environmental regulations should not stifle businesses, jobs, or innovation, but should rather incentivize efficient and sustainable practices. We need to harness the power of the free market to drive environmental solutions, which in the long run would ensure sustainable economic and environmental health."
"The rise of communist China as a global superpower is a cause for concern. The lack of transparency, the suppression of human rights, and questionable trade practices threaten the principles of liberty and free market economies. It's imperative that nations unite to defend these principles, and ensure fair and ethical practices in the global arena."

"Our country was founded on principles of individual liberty, limited government, and free markets. It's critical that we faithfully uphold these traditions, especially when discussing our healthcare system. By encouraging competition and consumer choice, not government control, we can better ensure high-quality, affordable care for all Americans."

It's crucial for us to harness innovation and technology to address environmental issues, instead of relying primarily on restrictive governmental policies."
"I believe in the importance of individual rights and responsibilities over government intervention.

This, in turn, encourages competition and innovation, which can lead to better services for all."
"I firmly stand for the principle of religious freedom guaranteed by our Constitution, which is an essential part of the individual liberty we all cherish.

Individual liberty and personal responsibility should be championed, ensuring that citizens have the freedom to make their own choices and bear the consequences of those decisions. Strong national defense is vital to protect and uphold our values and way of life."
"I believe that a free market economy promotes innovation, competition, and economic growth. Lower taxes and minimal government intervention provide businesses the opportunity to thrive, thus creating job opportunities and prosperity for all. Moreover, each individual should take personal responsibility for their financial well-being rather than rely too heavily on government support."
"I firmly believe in the importance of religious freedom as a cornerstone of our society, noting that it's a fundamental right that ensures every individual's choice to practice or not practice any faith. It is equally important that government remains neutral in matters of religion, not favoring one over another, so as not to infringe upon this personal liberty. This way, we can maintain a respectful environment that fosters a variety of beliefs and ideas."
"In regards to religious freedom, I firmly believe that our nation was founded on the principle of liberty, which includes the freedom to practice any religion without interference from the government. The principle of separation of church and state must be preserved to ensure the government does not endorse or favor a specific religion. This fundamental right contributes to the vibrant diversity that strengthens our country."
"The unchecked rise of China as a global superpower is a pressing concern. Their aggressive military expansion in the South China Sea, coupled with their economic dominance and questionable human rights record, represents a real threat to the balance of global power. It is essential that Western democracies forge strong alliances and bolster their defenses to safeguard their sovereignty and freedom."
"It's crucial that we uphold the rule of law and prioritize security within our national borders. When addressing immigration, a balanced approach that respects both human dignity and the need for a structured, legal process is necessary. In terms of racial justice, it's essential to recognize individual achievements and capabilities, rather than focusing solely on race or ethnicity."
"While the subject of increasing the minimum wage is often posed as a straightforward solution to help lower income workers, it is crucial that we also consider the potential negative repercussions. A significant hike could inadvertently lead to job cuts or reduced hours, as small and medium businesses struggle to meet payroll. It's essential that we balance employee needs with measures that don't jeopardize the very businesses that employ them."
"I firmly believe in the importance of the traditional family unit as the cornerstone of our society.

"I believe in the fundamental right of every individual to practice their religion freely, without fear of persecution or prejudice.

However, it is equally important that religious freedoms should not infringe upon others' rights or be used as a cover for unlawful activities."
"I firmly believe in preserving the traditional values and the moral fabric of our society, which I believe is rooted in our religious teachings.

Each nation should have the liberty to enact its own policies and protect its citizens' interests without interference from supranational bodies.
"Our national security relies heavily on a strong and well-funded military to ensure America's sovereignty and continued global leadership. Trade agreements should promote America's economic interests first, while not losing sight of reciprocal fairness.

It's important to strike a balance that allows for both environmental well-being and economic growth."
"The notion of limited government, often misconstrued as anarchy by some, is simply about the preservation of individual freedoms and rights. It's about empowering citizens to make their own decisions without unnecessary interference from the state. High taxes and over-regulation stifle innovation, and it's crucial to maintain a balanced approach that encourages economic growth and personal liberty."
"I firmly believe in the power of the free market and the principle of self-reliance.

"Our great nation thrived on the principles of individual liberty, free market competition, and limited government intervention.

"From my perspective, it is essential to uphold the sanctity and freedom of religious practice, a principle deeply rooted in our nation's constitution.

This protection is a fundamental pillar of our liberty, and it should not be compromised for the sake of political expediency."
"The issue of national borders is not simply about lines on a map, but about preserving a nation's identity, culture, and security.

Open-door policies may sound appealing on a superficial humanitarian level, but they often overlook the long-term economic, social, and security implications."

Government involvement should be minimal, focusing on setting fair regulations and protecting consumer rights. Through this, we can guarantee a market-driven, competitive healthcare system that provides the best services for its people."
"Preserving the traditional family structure is integral for maintaining societal balance and development. The roles of a mother and a father, each unique and irreplaceable, contribute to the psychological, emotional, and social growth of a child. A society that loses respect for these conventional roles risks destabilizing its very foundation."
"While it is undeniable that we are stewards of our planet, we must also recognize the importance of economic growth and personal freedom. We should invest in sustainable and efficient technologies, but not at the expense of crippling our industries and infringing on individual rights. A balanced, pragmatic approach would be most beneficial for both our environment and our economy."
"With regard to the ongoing tensions in the South China Sea, it's crucial to prioritize international law, territorial sovereignty and promote discussions between the involved nations.

Furthermore, it is crucial to maintain fiscal responsibility and limit excessive government spending, to foster an environment in which businesses and individuals can thrive."
"The need for securing our borders is paramount, not out of a lack of compassion for those seeking opportunity, but from a perspective of national security and economic stability. Our country's resources should first be directed towards the well-being of our own citizens and the integration of those who have legally pursued the opportunity to contribute to our society. It's crucial that we maintain policies that prioritize the rule of law and balance compassion with the necessity of maintaining order."
"When it comes to the issue of taxation, I firmly believe in fostering an economic environment that encourages growth and prosperity for all.

"The principle of limited government, as well as individual and fiscal responsibility, should be upheld, particularly in the issue of healthcare reform. The private sector, when allowed to freely compete, often delivers more efficient and innovative solutions than a state-managed system. Government intervention should be restrained, promoting personal responsibility and market competition to drive down prices and improve quality."
"The recent push towards globalism is concerning. While international cooperation and goodwill are important, it's critical that each country prioritizes its own citizens and their needs first.

"It's important to uphold the freedom of practicing one's faith without any interference, which is a cornerstone of our democratic society.

However, this should not infrive upon the rights of others, and mutual respect for differing religious or non-religious beliefs must be upheld."
"I believe in the importance of a strong economy, which can be achieved through limited government intervention, lower taxes, and free market capitalism.

The goal should always be to promote fairness and equality, and to ensure that all individuals, regardless of race, have access to the same opportunities."
"While it's essential to provide support to those in need, we should not neglect the importance of encouraging self-sufficiency and personal responsibility.

Rational regulation and limited government intervention, coupled with individual initiative, can ultimately lead to robust economic growth and prosperity."
"I believe that preserving the traditional family structure offers numerous benefits for society, including stability, economic well-being, and emotional development for children.
